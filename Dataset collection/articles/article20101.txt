5 2010-01-01 The Eureka, a Zeppelin NT, one of only three in the world, cost about $15 million and took 18 months to build. It is a reminder of the airships that once flew regularly from the Naval Air Station at Moffett Field. The Navy’s last rigid dirigible, the Macon, went down in bad weather off Point Sur in 1935. The Navy also flew blimps — smaller non-rigid aircraft — from Moffett Field until 1947, when jets supplanted them for offshore surveillance.

The idea of updating the decades-old technology of rigid airships appealed to Ms. Hall and her husband and co-founder of the company, Brian Hall, who had already started a software company that he still runs. On a trip to Germany, Mr. Hall was surprised and delighted to find that the company Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik had already done it.

That company was founded by Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the inventor of the rigid dirigible, and grew into a multibillion-euro supplier of construction equipment. In the 1980s, Zeppelin decided to build an updated, semi-rigid version of its flagship called the Zeppelin NT, for “new technology.” The first one flew in 1997.

Unlike the infamous Hindenburg — whose hydrogen gas exploded in flames in 1937 at Lakehurst, N.J., killing 36 people and ending the commercial zeppelin business in the United States — the Eureka is held aloft by inert helium gas. Other modern improvements in the Zeppelin NT include carbon fiber struts, computerized helium management, fly-by-wire controls and custom-designed swiveling engines.

At 246 feet long, the Eureka would be dwarfed by the 803-foot Hindenburg, yet it is among the largest objects in the skies today, longer than any passenger jet. The Goodyear Blimp “Spirit of America” is 192 feet long.

The Halls turned to Silicon Valley to raise money, planning to earn revenues through ticket sales, advertising, and scientific and other special missions. The pair eventually raised $12 million, which included money Mr. Hall had earned from his other company, cash from the sale of Ms. Hall’s Oakland home and money from four outside investors. Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik provided lease financing.

Then Ms. Hall scored another coup: she was able to convince the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which currently operates Moffett Field, to keep the Eureka there. The Macon had been housed in Hangar One, the massive grey dome that still looms above the Spanish-style buildings of the main base and is a well-known landmark in the largely uninspiring Silicon Valley landscape. Airship Ventures pays $6,000 a month for part of Hangar Two, which was once home to a squadron of blimps.

The Bay Area seemed ideal for all three of the company’s planned revenue streams. According to census data, one in 10 Bay Area jobs was related to tourism in 2007; the Outdoor Advertising Association of America says the region is the fourth-biggest outdoor advertising market in the country; and the area is home to several big research institutions, including NASA.

But the timing was atrocious. In the past year, tourism expenditures across the region have declined sharply. According to a new report from PKF, a hospitality industry consulting firm, San Francisco lodging revenues in 2009 declined by about 20 percent from 2008.

John duGan, who has operated a helicopter tour company called Bay Aerial for the past decade, said his business was easily down 50 percent. “Things fell off a cliff,” Mr. duGan said.

Advertising, which Airship Ventures had hoped would yield a quarter of its revenues, has fared no better. Nationwide, outdoor advertising was down 17 percent in the first nine months of the year. Advertising spending over all was down more than 10 percent, and most forecasts do not predict recovery until 2011 at the earliest, especially for expensive placements like the zeppelin. Typical deals using the Eureka start at $250,000 a month, and the ship has flown just two major placements in its first year.

Airship Ventures originally expected to earn 60 percent of revenues through ticket sales, but Ms. Hall said the share had ended up being much higher due to the weak advertising and stronger-than-expected demand for private charters. Bay Area residents have also been surprisingly eager to fly — about 80 percent of the zeppelin’s customers are from the region — cushioning the balance sheet somewhat from the worldwide decline in tourism.

Most of the 12 seats are filled on each flight, and the company has nearly $750,000 in advance bookings — an indication of future demand but, under state law, money it cannot touch until passengers actually fly.

The flight experience is remarkably casual. The pilots sit in the same space as the passengers. The cabin is reminiscent of a comfortable business jet, but with huge picture windows, some of which open. “We encourage people to get ‘Zep head,’ ” Mr. Hall said, “like a dog sticking its head out of the window of a car.” (The airship typically cruises at half its top speed of 60 knots, or about 70 miles per hour.)

The Eureka’s motion is stable and smooth, said Brian Kusler, who recently spent nearly a thousand dollars on a pair of tickets for an hourlong flight above San Francisco to celebrate his partner’s 40th birthday. “It was a little scary leaning out the window,” he said, “but now I’m hooked.”

Some of the slack demand from tourists and advertisers may be picked up by special missions, which have been growing faster than expected, Ms. Hall said. This fall, the Eureka flew a scientific mission for NASA above the salt ponds in the South Bay. The craft is also slated to hover above the big waves at Mavericks, near Santa Cruz, when the annual surfing competition takes place in the coming weeks.

For now, the Eureka typically flies five days a week rather than the planned seven, and some of this winter’s flights are being operated from Long Beach, where the weather is more reliably friendly.

So far, Airship Ventures has avoided any layoffs or pay cuts among its staff of 38, which includes two pilots. But in order to stay aloft, it has had to return to its investors for additional financing, and its original plan to order two more Zeppelin NTs — one for special missions and one for the East Coast — has been delayed.

“We can continue to ride this out for some time yet,” Ms. Hall said, “but not indefinitely.”
6 2010-01-01 Re “How to Find the Bridge? First, Pay Your Respects” (news article, Dec. 28):

The article on the Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp states, “The shooting was considered an act of terrorism.”

Yes, the 1994 shooting of Ari Halberstam was an act of terrorism, but, astonishingly, it was not labeled as such by the F.B.I. until December 2000.

Despite the efforts of elected officials and, above all, Ari’s mother, Devorah Halberstam, the F.B.I. insisted on attributing the horrific crime to “road rage.” Only in 1999 did the F.B.I. initiate a review of the case.

Six years after the shooting, it finally acknowledged the obvious — this was a planned attack to kill Jews, and the van carrying Ari Halberstam and other religious youngsters was an inviting target.

Our country at times still has difficulty connecting the dots and understanding what constitutes terrorism. Witness, for instance, the fatal shootings at Fort Hood in November, and the painfully slow recognition of the killer’s motives, not to mention the pattern of missed signals preceding the attack.

The Halberstam tragedy is a case study in what can go wrong with a terrorism investigation.

It should not require a victim’s determined mother to set the record straight and try to wake up America.
7 2010-01-01 Economics rather than politics will be the main driver of the fight against global warming in 2010. In 2009, the global recession had a greater impact than all the diplomatic efforts that ended in the Copenhagen flop: energy production had not declined on such a scale since 1981, according to the International Energy Agency.

Here are five economic reasons for the world to become slightly greener in the coming year (just a few of them could be wishful thinking).

First, high oil prices. Costlier crude encourages investments in alternative energy sources. Crude oil has been trading in a fairly narrow — and reassuringly expensive — range of $64 to $80 a barrel since June. It is not likely to fall below that level.

True, inventories are abundant, and in the longer term Iraqi oil is emerging from the rubble. But there are several reasons to think oil prices will hold up through 2010 and beyond. Demand growth in big emerging nations like China and India is a solid support. Downward pressure on the dollar would probably help sustain prices. And OPEC probably still has enough power to keep prices from plummeting. So while the oil price is not likely to shoot up to recession-inducing highs, it is likely to stay high enough to keep alternative energy resources profitable.

Second, the low price of natural gas. Cheap gas encourages utilities to build more gas-fired power plants, which are cleaner than coal-powered ones. The current gas supply glut is not likely to go away soon. Even the always-possible Russia-Ukraine row, or a colder than usual winter, probably would not be enough to raise world prices.
8 2010-01-01 Among those killed, officials said, was the chief of the Khost base, who was a mother of three and a veteran of the agency’s clandestine branch. Besides the seven C.I.A. operatives who died, the blast also wounded six agency employees, according to a C.I.A. statement.

Current and former intelligence officials said Thursday that early evidence indicated that the bomber, in Afghan military fatigues, might have been taken onto the base as a possible informant and might not have been subjected to rigorous screening. But details about the episode remained murky, and a NATO official said the bomber had managed to elude security and reach an area near the base’s gym.

C.I.A. personnel regularly take foreign agents onto the base before sending them on intelligence collection missions in eastern Afghanistan and across the border into Pakistan, said one Pentagon consultant who works closely with the C.I.A. in Afghanistan.

“You must to some degree make yourself known to people you don’t trust,” said one American intelligence official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to discuss classified information.

The bomber appears to have worn an explosives-laden suicide vest under an Afghan National Army uniform, two NATO officials said Thursday. The attack happened close to dusk, when some people at the base were relaxing before dinner.

In a statement to the C.I.A.’s work force, President Obama said that the spy agency had been “tested as never before,” and that C.I.A. operatives had “served on the front lines in directly confronting the dangers of the 21st century.”

Forward Operating Base Chapman sits in an isolated spot several miles from the town of Khost, but not far from Camp Salerno, a larger base used by Special Operations troops.

American officials said that the C.I.A. base had been a focal point for counterterrorism operations against the Haqqani network, a particularly lethal militant group that operates on both sides of the Afghan border.

“Those guys have recently been on a big Haqqani binge,” said the Pentagon consultant. “I would be really shocked if the bombing on Wednesday wasn’t some kind of retaliation.”

There was an air of defiance among intelligence officials on the day after the attack, and some spoke of their fallen comrades using military language.

“There is no pullout,” the American intelligence official said. “There is no withdrawal or anything like that planned.”

The C.I.A. has always had a paramilitary branch known as the Special Activities Division, which secretly engaged in the kinds of operations more routinely carried out by Special Operations troops. But the branch was a small — and seldom used — part of its operations.

That changed after Sept. 11, 2001, when President George W. Bush gave the agency expanded authority to capture or kill Qaeda operatives around the world. Since then, Washington has relied much more on the Special Activities Division because battling suspected terrorists does not involve fighting other armies. Rather, it involves secretly moving in and out of countries like Pakistan and Somalia where the American military is not legally allowed to operate.

The fact that the agency is in effect running a war in Pakistan is the culmination of one of the most significant shifts in the C.I.A.’s history. But the agency has at times struggled with this new role. It established a network of secret overseas jails where terrorist suspects were subjected to brutal interrogation techniques, and it set up an assassination program that at one point was outsourced to employees of a private security company, then known as Blackwater USA.

Some longtime agency officers bristled at what they saw as the militarization of the C.I.A., worrying that it was straying too far from its historical missions of espionage and intelligence analysis.

When he took office in January, President Obama scaled back the C.I.A.’s counterterrorism mission, but only to a point. He ordered that C.I.A. prisons be shut and that C.I.A officers no longer play a role in interrogating suspects accused of terrorist acts.

At the same time, the administration has accelerated the C.I.A.’s drone campaign, using Predator and Reaper aircraft to launch missiles and rockets against militants in Pakistan.

In early 2009, the White House approved a C.I.A. plan to expand the drone operations in Pakistan into Baluchistan, where top leaders of Afghanistan’s Taliban militia are thought to be hiding. The agency has also recently begun sending more operatives into Pakistan to, among other things, gather target intelligence for the drone program.
9 2010-01-01 “This is a simple, common-sense solution to ensure that New York City residents are breathing cleaner air,” said Michael Seilback, vice president for public policy and communications for the Lung Association in New York State and New York City.

City officials say they have been trying to settle on the best approach for ridding buildings of the dirty oil for about a year and expect to issue new rules early this year.

Building owners say it can take more than $100,000 to replace oil burners, clean up tanks and switch their heating systems to cleaner oil or to gain access to suitable natural gas pipelines.

Rohit T. Aggarwala, director of the mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, said the city must weigh the costs of a changeover and the availability of natural gas citywide. “We’re working on a fix,” said Jason Post, a spokesman for the mayor’s office. “We want to do this right.”

The Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group, recently issued its own report saying that just 1 percent of all buildings in the city — about 9,000 large commercial, residential and institutional structures — create 87 percent of the soot pollution arising from heating oil. (The group has posted a list at www.edf.org/dirtybuildings so New Yorkers can see which kind of oil their buildings burn.)

If those buildings were to burn cleaner oil, the fund’s report said, the amount of airborne pollutants they release would decline by as much as 65 percent to 95 percent.

The numbers by which heating oil is classified are based on boiling temperature, composition and other factors. No. 2 heating oil, which is cleaner but more expensive than No. 6 or No. 4, accounts for an estimated 73 percent of the heating oil burned in the city, the environmental group found.

Evan Thies, a spokesman for the group, said users of the most polluting fuels tended to be larger buildings that could accommodate huge boilers that generate the heat necessary to burn heavy oil.

The dirtiest oils can cost about 60 cents less a gallon, which has been another disincentive for buildings to upgrade their boilers. But in its report, the Environmental Defense Fund said that cleaner fuels improve the efficiency of burners and reduce operating costs, compensating for the up-front costs and the higher price of No. 2 oil.

The group, using records from the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, which approves boiler permits, points out in its report that heavy oil heats buildings in some of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the city, most of them in Manhattan.

The pollution is aggravated by diesel fuel emissions from heavy car and truck traffic in some areas. But Stuart M. Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, says the assumption that only the rich live in the buildings at issue ignores the reality that even at wealthy addresses, “there are people living on fixed incomes or on Social Security who bought their apartments 40 years ago.”

Aside from the $100,000 that he estimates it would cost up front for the average 100- to 150-unit building to replace its oil burner and clean up its oil tanks to make the switch, the cost difference between the dirty and cleaner oils is substantial, Mr. Saft said.

His group, he said, would oppose any phase-out that did not exempt “functioning” heating systems, as opposed to those at the end of their life.

But some buildings are already converting their systems as part of broader environmental efforts.

Diane C. Nardone, president of the board at 11 Fifth Avenue, a 288-apartment cooperative in two 20-story buildings in Greenwich Village, said it was in the midst of converting to natural gas from two boilers that use No. 6 oil. She said the switch would cost roughly $225,000, which the co-op will be able to cover after refinancing its mortgage.

But the cooperative expects to recoup the up-front costs in about two years through fuel savings, she said, given that natural gas will be cheaper than oil in the long run.

“We understand the impact it will have on the economics of the building and, equally important, on the environment,” she said.

The co-op is also installing two new roofs with vegetation that will absorb rainwater, and energy-efficient windows. Still, Ms. Nardone said that city and state governments needed to offer more financial incentives to help buildings meet any new environmental regulations.

“Give property tax credits, make loans available at low interest, if you want the general population to take the measures that need to be taken to improve the environment,” she said.

City officials say older people and young children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, which can irritate the lungs and worsen conditions like asthma and emphysema, as well as increase the risk of heart attack and premature death.

Mindful of the health risks, the city is already converting some of its own heavy-oil-burning boilers to natural gas, after identifying 100 city school buildings burning No. 6 oil in neighborhoods with high asthma rates.
10 2010-01-01 The memorial service for Percy E. Sutton, the legendary Harlem politician and mentor to Gov. David A. Paterson, has caused a major scheduling headache: The service is scheduled to start just hours before Mr. Paterson is to deliver his 2010 State of the State address.

The family of Mr. Sutton, a former Manhattan borough president and Harlem elder statesman who died on Saturday, is holding his memorial service Wednesday at 11 a.m. at Riverside Church in Manhattan.

But Mr. Paterson is scheduled to deliver his address at 1 p.m. in Albany, 140 miles to the north, to an audience of hundreds of lawmakers and dignitaries.

The scheduling conflict was not intentional.

“The deciding factor had to do with getting the most people, family members and close friends who wanted to be there,” said Terrie M. Williams, a spokeswoman for the Sutton family. “This is what the family decided to do.”

On Thursday morning, a Manhattan news Web site, DNAinfo.com, reported that Mr. Paterson would be unable to attend the memorial service. Later in the day, however, Mr. Paterson said that he would attend the beginning of Mr. Sutton’s memorial, then return to Albany, probably on a state aircraft.
11 2010-01-01 The government of Xinjiang, the restive, predominantly Muslim region in far western China shaken recently by ethnic strife, said Thursday that it had adopted what appeared to be a sweeping law barring the spread of views deemed to threaten national unity. The government said on its Web site that the measure, a vaguely described law on “education for ethnic unity in Xinjiang,” was adopted Tuesday by the local legislature and would take effect in February.
12 2010-01-01 Hundreds of police officers broke up an anti-Kremlin protest in Moscow on Thursday and detained dozens of people, including Lyudmila M. Alekseyeva, 82, one of this year’s recipients of the European Union’s top human rights award. In a statement released in Washington, Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said, “The United States expresses dismay at reports that authorities in Moscow prevented Russian citizens from exercising their right to assemble peacefully.” Protests were also held on the 31st of July, August and October; the right to assembly is guaranteed in the 31st Article of the Russian Constitution. In seeking to abort plans for Thursday’s protest, the police had said it would interfere with New Year’s festivities.
13 2010-01-01 Wells Fargo & Company, the San Francisco-based bank, said Thursday that it gave its chief executive, John G. Stumpf, and three others stock bonuses worth about $25 million, but that none of the executives will receive a cash bonus for 2009.

Mr. Stumpf received 379,600 shares, valued at about $10 million. The chief financial officer, Howard I. Atkins; the head of wholesale banking, David A. Hoyt; and the head of home and consumer finance, Mark C. Oman, each received 189,800 shares, worth about $5 million each.

The stock payouts will vest after three years and only if the bank meets certain performance goals, Wells Fargo said in a statement. The executives will forfeit the payouts if they leave the company for a rival, and they must hold a portion of all their shares for as long as they are employed by Wells Fargo, according to the statement.

Wells Fargo’s move follows that of the Goldman Sachs Group, which in December said it would pay its top managers their 2009 bonuses in stock rather than cash.

Morgan Stanley also is considering proposals to align pay with long-term performance, through measures like awarding compensation based in part on the bank’s share performance relative to peers, according to media reports.
14 2010-01-01 So, 19 months ago, the program hired Jim Russell, a news consultant who created “Marketplace” in 1989 and ran it for many years, to come up with a new approach.

“They were particularly concerned, and I believe properly so, that the show was old-fashioned,” Mr. Russell said. “When it was born 30 years ago, it was novel, exciting, radical, but 30 years had passed.” Today, he said, as he analyzed the problems, “nobody waited until 6:30 in the evening to get stock market information.”

The show’s mission, he said, would not change: “To educate its audience and empower viewers to make better financial decisions.” And it will still avoid hyperbole and sensation, he said, but it will focus “less on being the show of record in terms of what’s happening.”

In addition to more analysis and enterprise reporting, Mr. Ward said, “we’ve been working really hard with our reporters, producers and photographers about the way in which we tell stories,” to make the approach more conversational, and “not deliver a message from the mount.”

Those associated with the show are prepared for some audience complaints, but Mr. Russell said that by introducing the changes over a year, the evolution should be less jarring to dedicated viewers. “We’ve got a very critical audience, and I’m sure we will continue to hear from them,” said Ms. Gharib, adding, “So far, the feedback has been very positive.”

Ratings have been slipping but remain strong; Stuart Zuckerman, vice president for sales and marketing for “Nightly Business Report,” said the program in November drew an average 205,000 adult viewers ages 35 to 64 each night, putting it ahead of CNBC’s top-rated “Closing Bell.”

Over all, he said, it reached 530,000 viewers on average daily. The show needs additional underwriters, in addition to Franklin Templeton and Exxon Mobil, to meet its fiscal year budget, he said.

More than 100 candidates were considered to succeed Mr. Kangas. Mr. Hudson, who had been co-anchor of the nationally syndicated “First Business” report, is relocating from Chicago for the job. He got it, Mr. Russell said, because “he’s unpretentious. He’s not a golden throat, he’s not beautiful, he has kind of a normal look, a real person look. But he’s substantive; he cares about this stuff.”

Once the changes are in place, PBS plans to begin a promotion for both “Nightly Business Report” and “The PBS NewsHour,” which had its own reformatting in early December, including the addition of a co-anchor for Jim Lehrer, and a new emphasis on sending viewers to the show’s Web site.

While some viewers have complained to the PBS ombudsman about the “NewsHour” revamp, during the Dec. 7 week of the revised program, “NewsHour” executives said, traffic at the redesigned Web site jumped by double digits, online video views nearly doubled from a year earlier and the average time spent on the site increased. Ratings for the TV program are not yet available.
15 2010-01-01 Gone will be any events featuring the mayor hobnobbing with rich and connected friends at a postinaugural fete.

Instead, Mr. Bloomberg will participate in volunteer projects around the city. First, he will prepare meals at an emergency food program in Park Slope, Brooklyn. After delivering his speech, he will head to Staten Island’s borough hall to assemble care packages for soldiers. Then, onto an arts warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, where he will sort donated items to be distributed to schools and cultural groups. And finally, Hunts Point, in the Bronx, where he will help to paint a mural at a recreation center.

Gone, as well, will be the grand approach as a triumphant mayor wades through the crowds for his big inaugural close-up.

Instead, Mr. Bloomberg will enter from the back of the stage that has been erected outside City Hall, and he will be accompanied by two new citywide officials who are likely to be fierce watchdogs over the next four years: John C. Liu, the new comptroller and the first Asian-American to be elected to citywide office; and Bill de Blasio, the new public advocate.

Instead of tapping Al Leiter (2002) or Barbara Walters and John Lithgow (2006) as the masters of ceremonies, there will be six this time: students from Newcomers High School in Long Island City.

Mr. Bloomberg’s inaugural speech, estimated to be roughly 12 minutes long, is expected to touch on a few big-picture ideas and exhort New Yorkers to work together during difficult times.

“The mayor wanted to put service ahead of celebration,” said James Anderson, the mayor’s communications director.

Legally, Mr. Bloomberg signed the official oath on Thursday afternoon, after paying his $9 registration fee in the presence of Michael McSweeney, the city clerk. Mr. Bloomberg is an independent who ran as a Republican.

About 4,200 people are expected to attend the one-hour ceremony, in which Mr. Liu and Mr. de Blasio will also deliver addresses.

A few prominent people won’t be there. Gov. David A. Paterson is hosting an open house at the governor’s mansion in Albany. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is traveling. Neither of New York’s senators, Charles E. Schumer or Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrats who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg’s opponent, William C. Thompson Jr., will attend. But former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins will attend.

One person who won’t make it for the third time in a row is Mr. Bloomberg’s mother, Charlotte. She turns 101 on Saturday and is not inclined to travel as much these days. Still, Mr. Bloomberg plans to celebrate her birthday by returning home to Medford, Mass., as he does every year.
16 2010-01-01 Since March, the Dow has jumped about 60 percent, in part because of growing confidence that the deepest downturn since the Depression was beginning to subside. Rock-bottom interest rates have also helped lure investors to stocks and away from safe havens like government bonds.

But boom years do not usually follow boom years, and few economists expect the turbocharged atmosphere of 2009 to extend into the new year. Growth is expected to continue as spending by consumers increases and job losses dwindle, but analysts say the gains will be less substantial now that the economy has come back from the brink.

Financial shares helped drive the market in 2009, and that sector is expected to do the same in the new year with the help of gains in energy and technology.

Shares of banks and investment firms started 2009 at a fraction of their levels from before the financial crisis, positioning them to benefit significantly as the economy improved, analysts said. As nervous investors shifted billions into bond markets, banks profited by underwriting those securities. As stock market trading picked up, investment firms reaped the benefits.

“Once we started seeing a turnaround in these banks, we saw a turnaround in the stock market,” said Ashwani Kaul, a market analyst and head of global research for Thomson Reuters. “Financials were the backbone in 2009.”

Goldman Sachs, for instance, tumbled to $59.20 a share in January but finished at $168.84 a share on Thursday.

In 2010, analysts expect financial stocks to continue to rise, though at a slower pace. Investors acknowledge that the sector faces several obstacles: the threat of increased oversight from the federal government, for instance, and the potential for more losses on bad loans.

“What are the new rules of the world? What does the industry look like? How do we plan strategically for growth?” said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup’s chief equity strategist. “These are significant unknowns to investors, but they are pretty important to determining the future of the industry.”

Another question is how companies, particularly banks, will pump up revenue. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, companies achieved better-than-expected earnings through heavy cost-cutting, but many now seem reluctant to cut any more, fearing that quality will suffer.

Banks will also face added pressure from Washington, which is set to crack down on credit card penalties and debit card overdraft fees, two crucial revenue streams. In addition, a few firms are still repaying emergency federal aid. And a large part of the industry is tied to the housing market, which could stumble as mortgage rates climb and foreclosed homes inundate the market.

As they tried to pay back emergency aid from the federal government, many banks raised additional capital through share offerings, leaving them with a larger number of shareholders. Analysts said that may increase the pressure for bigger earnings, which may lead to tighter lending standards as banks try to prevent losses on loans.

“It will hold the banks’ feet to the fire a little more on their earnings,” said Brian A. Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight.

Thomson Reuters researchers expect S.& P. 500 financial firms to bring in $102 billion in earnings in 2010 — double the $51 billion in 2009 — as consumer spending picks up and loan losses ease. They predict 12 percent overall growth in the equity market next year, much of it driven by banks and investment stocks.

“As they start to post healthy profits, financials are really ripe for a rally,” Mr. Kaul said.

Some analysts expect an increase in mergers and acquisitions as business confidence improves, and they say write-offs that drained earnings in 2009 will decrease.

“Financial institutions have a long road back to get back to the mid-2007, pre-subprime crisis levels,” said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla. “But if you post four or five consecutive quarters of growth, credit markets unfreeze, the economy recovers and you start doing business again — voilà! — Bank of America starts to look good again.”

The rally was moved to South America in 2009 because of safety concerns and the possibility of a terrorist attack in Africa.
21 2010-01-02 One rainy day in late autumn, the scene in the family’s two-bedroom apartment — the boys share one, and Ms. Byers and Rayshell the other — is the familiar chaos of teenagers coming home, sharing stories from school, and then racing out to meet friends.

Curtis, now 16, well over six feet tall and with a thick halo of hair, is the first home, but he is out the quickest. He’s shy, Ms. Byers says, and doesn’t like to talk about himself, even with her.

“He’s smart, and he likes science and history,” she said. “But his mind is not at school.”

Rayshell comes in next. Fourteen and a student at the High School for Law and Public Service, she has a plan: to become a model and use her earnings to pay for college and law school.

“I want to become a lawyer because I’m loud,” she jokes. In a more serious vein, she confides that her goal is to become a judge because “I like helping people, and everyone deserves a second chance.”

Daniel, 17, is last in the door after a day of classes at Park West High School in Hell’s Kitchen, where he is preparing for a career in cooking.

“He’s wanted to be a chef since he was 5 years old,” Ms. Byers said. “He says he wants to be a pastry chef, and I told him, ‘I don’t like pastry. I like food.’ ”

Daniel says he would like to enroll in a culinary school and is looking for restaurant jobs to hone his skills. To help him prepare, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, has provided $110 to help him buy an electric mixer and baking tins. The agency also has given the Byers family $50 in Neediest Cases money to pay for Rayshell’s application fee to an after-school arts program and $129 for a toolbox for Curtis.

The children have never heard from the woman who gave birth to them, but they are clear on who their mother is — even when others are not.

Rayshell says people often ask if Ms. Byers is her grandmother.

“I don’t get mad. I just say, ‘This is my mom, and I love her,’ ” she says, “and my brothers.”
22 2010-01-02 British house prices rose for an eighth straight month in December as a scarcity of homes for sale and signs that the economy was emerging from the worst recession on record pushed up prices, the Nationwide Building Society said. The average cost of a home increased 0.4 percent from the previous month, to £162,103 ($260,086), the mortgage lender said Thursday. Prices rose 5.9 percent from a year earlier. Home values are 12.2 percent lower than at their peak in October 2007. The “restriction in supply meant that even a relatively modest pickup in demand was able to put upward pressure on house prices,” Martin Gahbauer, Nationwide’s chief economist, said in a statement.
23 2010-01-02 MOSCOW — Russia’s cheapest thrill disappeared at dawn on Friday, when the minimum price for a half-liter of vodka rose to 89 rubles, or around $3, from an earlier price of $1.69.

The change is part of an anti-alcoholism campaign by President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who had said he was shaken by recent data showing that Russians consume 4.75 gallons of pure alcohol per capita every year, more than double the level that the World Health Organization considers a health threat. (The average American, by comparison, consumes 2.3 gallons of pure alcohol per year.)

A study published in The Lancet, a British medical journal, found that more than half the deaths of Russians between the ages of 15 and 54 were caused by drinking.

A raft of new measures will be imposed on July 1, including a crackdown on the production of illegal vodka, known as samogon. Mr. Medvedev has proposed banning sales of beer from sidewalk kiosks and prohibiting the large, cheap containers of beer preferred by young Russians. But the increase in vodka prices — especially at the outset of a 12-day winter holiday — drives straight at one of Russia’s fundamental appetites.

Viktor Zubkov, Russia’s first vice prime minister, told the RIA-Novosti news service that regulators would begin spot checks of wholesalers to make sure they were complying with the new norms. Already, 50 licenses for vodka producers have been suspended and 10 have been revoked, he said.

In 1985, Mikhail S. Gorbachev began a widespread anti-alcohol campaign, ordering distilleries, breweries and vineyards razed. The measures at first seemed effective but gave way to a public backlash that irretrievably damaged Mr. Gorbachev’s popularity. It also bolstered production of samogon, distilled from fermented sugar, yeast and water, and proved a serious blow to state revenues. The campaign was abandoned in 1987.
24 2010-01-02 Those figures are measured in dollars to assure international comparability. The dollar also weakened over the period, meaning that the apparent returns were even worse when measured in other currencies.

Of course, things looked much worse a year ago.

In 2009, stock markets around the world recovered strongly after hitting bottom in late winter. For the year, the American index was up about 27 percent and the developed world rose about 31 percent.

But it was a different story for emerging markets, which actually did emerge. When the decade began, China had the 43rd-largest stock market in the world, trailing such countries as the Philippines, Peru and Poland. At the end of the decade, its market capitalization ranked ninth in the world, having passed countries like Brazil, Spain and Italy.

Much of that growth was the result of new issues, as China partly privatized many government-owned enterprises. But an investor in Chinese stocks over the decade would have earned more than 150 percent, or a compounded 9.7 percent.

Among emerging markets, that return was actually a little below average. As a group, emerging markets gained about 160 percent, or 10.1 percent a year. Brazil’s market grew more than 500 percent, or 20 percent a year. India climbed at an annual rate of 14.1 percent, for a total gain of more than 270 percent.

Among the developed countries, the best performers for the decade were those that were most dependent on natural resources, whose prices generally rose, in part because of additional demand from expanding economies in emerging markets. Canada’s stock market more than doubled, providing an annual return of 9.2 percent, while Australia’s tripled, giving investors an annual return of 12.7 percent.

Just as few forecasters predicted the sad performance of most developed countries, so, too, did few foresee the gains for emerging markets. In 1999, memories were fresh of the Asian currency crisis and Russian default, which scared some investors away. There was also talk of a “digital divide,” in which the rich countries would profit from the Internet while poorer ones could not afford the needed infrastructure.

As it happened, the lessons of the Asian currency crisis served many emerging countries well, by encouraging them to amass large reserves of foreign currency, principally dollars. To do that, they sought to keep their currencies undervalued to encourage exports, and as a group they succeeded.

In the United States, and to some extent Europe, the end of the technology stock bubble brought on a recession, which was worsened by the reaction to the shock of Sept. 11, 2001. The Fed responded by driving interest rates to historic lows and keeping them there longer than now appears to have been wise.

Low interest rates stimulated consumer demand and caused Americans to buy more things, many of them imported. At the same time, the low rates, combined with a lowering of credit standards by mortgage issuers, caused home prices to soar, providing more consumer spending power as homeowners refinanced their loans and extracted equity.

When the party stopped in America, many emerging countries were well equipped to deal with the sudden difficulty in finding loans. With large foreign currency reserves, they were lenders, not borrowers.

The MSCI world indexes have a relatively short history, but the similar Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in the United States dates back to 1928. The decade of the zeros was the first decade ever that the S.&. P. 500 had a negative total return. Prices fell in the 1930s, but dividends moved the index narrowly into positive territory.

Bring on the teens. Please.
25 2010-01-02 The Musée du Luxembourg in Paris will close when its current exhibition, a display of Tiffany glass works, ends on Jan. 17, the French government has announced. The museum, housed in the Luxembourg Palace, has drawn more than 5.5 million visitors since its administration was turned over to a private company in 2000; its exhibitions have included shows focusing on Modigliani, Botticelli and the holdings of the Phillips Collection in Washington. But according to the Paris daily Le Monde, museum administrators and the French Senate, which controls the museum building, have quarreled over administrative and financial issues, and the Senate has decided to reassert its control. Two planned exhibitions, including one on Impressionism, have been canceled, and 100 full- and part-time employees are to be laid off.

31 2010-01-03 Ole Miss and Oklahoma State, also 9-4 a year ago, were both in the Associated Press preseason top 10 before early losses. They finished with a game of mistakes and missed opportunities. Each was stopped on fourth-and-goal from the 1, and Ole Miss missed two field-goal attempts.

Ole Miss quarterback Jevan Snead was 13 of 23 for 168 yards with three interceptions. Robinson was 13 of 27 for 118 yards with four interceptions.

McCluster leaves Ole Miss with 3,921 career all-purpose yards, second in team history behind Deuce McAllister’s 4,889.

ARKANSAS 20, E. CAROLINA 17 Alex Tejada kicked a 37-yard field goal in overtime to lift Arkansas in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis after East Carolina’s Ben Hartman missed two field-goal attempts late in regulation and another in overtime.

Hartman missed from 39 yards with 1:03 remaining and from the same distance on the final play of the fourth quarter, then missed from 35 in overtime. He missed four attempts in all.

Arkansas (8-5) won despite going 0 of 13 on third down. East Carolina (9-5) lost in the Liberty Bowl for the second straight season. Last season, a late fumble return by Kentucky doomed the Pirates.

Arkansas, which had averaged 37 points a game, had the ball for only 22:05. Ryan Mallett was named most valuable player, but he went only 15 of 36 for 202 yards and a touchdown.

Dominique Lindsay rushed for 151 yards on 33 carries for East Carolina. His 3-yard touchdown run opened the scoring in the second quarter, ending a 99-yard drive by the Pirates. It was 10-0 at halftime, the first time the Razorbacks had been shut out in the first half since September against Alabama.

The Razorbacks tied it in the third quarter when Tramain Thomas intercepted a pass and ran 37 yards to the end zone.

East Carolina retook the lead on Patrick Pinkney’s 13-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Harris with 5:52 left in the third. Arkansas answered 36 seconds later when Mallett threw a 41-yard scoring pass to Jarius Wright to make it 17-17.

S. FLORIDA 27, N. ILLINOIS 3 Mike Ford ran for a career-high 207 yards and scored a touchdown, and B. J. Daniels threw two scoring passes to A. J. Love as South Florida cruised past Northern Illinois in the International Bowl in Toronto.

Carlton Mitchell caught six passes for 94 yards for the Bulls, who won back-to-back bowls for the first time. South Florida beat Memphis, 41-14, in last year’s St. Petersburg Bowl.

South Florida scored 24 points in the second half after a dreary first half ended 3-3.
32 2010-01-03 Mr. Lanchester suggests that there are larger cultural forces at play. He traces the roots of the crisis to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before this transformative moment, he writes, Western democracies kept their banks on a relatively short leash. Otherwise, he says, they might have forfeited whatever moral authority they enjoyed over their Communist foes.

“The jet engine of capitalism,” Mr. Lanchester writes, “was harnessed to the oxcart of social justice, to much bleating from the advocates of pure capitalism, but with the effect that the Western liberal democracies became the most admirable societies that the world has ever seen.”

But when the Soviet Union fell, Mr. Lanchester laments, so did the checks and balances on capitalism. After that, he says, the forces of capitalism, particularly the harsher variety practiced in the United States and Britain, held a two-decade-long victory party.

Emboldened by their triumph, he writes, bankers made shameless demands of their governments and got nearly everything they wanted, including the right to trade dangerously complex securities with virtually no regulation.

When Mr. Lanchester delves into the crisis itself, the shortcomings of the book become apparent. He has obviously spent a great deal of time reading and thinking about the debacle. But if you are a student of the crisis, you have probably absorbed much of the same stuff.

Mr. Lanchester is fascinated with what he calls an almost mystical belief by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, in the self-regulating power of the markets, a view that fit perfectly with the post-cold-war mood. The author cleverly deconstructs Mr. Greenspan’s now-famous mea culpa before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the fall of 2008.

But Mr. Greenspan’s testimony has been much parsed lately. In recent months, I’ve read books by at least two authors who made the same points as Mr. Lanchester, albeit in less sophisticated prose.

Mr. Lanchester’s most insightful moments about the financial mess come in his reporting. He visits Baltimore, where thousands of borrowers have had their homes repossessed. Now their credit has been ruined, and many are having trouble renting apartments.

The author also spent considerable time talking to bankers, and comes away thinking that they suffer from an exalted opinion of themselves. “One of our culture’s deepest beliefs is expressed in the question, ‘If you are so smart, why ain’t you rich?’ ” he writes. “But people in finance are rich — so it logically follows that everything they chose to do must be smart. That was a syllogism followed by too many people in the money business.”

It’s also false. Mr. Lanchester writes that part of the reason many bankers are rich is that their profession has rigged the system. When the markets are good, they make money hand over fist. And when markets collapse? All too often, they are bailed out by the government.

Maybe that’s just another indication of how smart they are. Or it could be a dangerous moral failure. Mr. Lanchester says it is the latter.

It would have been nice if Mr. Lanchester had explored the psychology of the people who caused the crash much more deeply. But he decided not to. I have a feeling that he may be saving his best material for his recessionary novel. If so, it should be worth picking up. Until then, “I.O.U.” will have to do.
33 2010-01-03 Mary Willis White and Paul Edward Means were married Friday at Bourbon and Branch, a bar in San Francisco. Jeffrey Speckels, a friend of the couple who was named a deputy marriage commissioner by the city and county of San Francisco for the event, officiated.

Ms. White, 30, is keeping her name. She is a founder of Heiress Productions in New York, a nonprofit theater company that earmarks some of its proceeds for cancer-related charities. Its most recent production was “Belles,” by Mark Dunn, which was staged in March and April at the Lion Theater in New York. She graduated summa cum laude from Shenandoah University in Winchester, Va. The bride’s first marriage ended in divorce.

She is a daughter of Glenne W. White and C. Ridgely White V of Winchester. The bride’s father, who is retired, was a vice president of the F & M Bank there. Her mother retired as the library media coordinator for the Winchester public schools.

Mr. Means, 30, is a second-year law student at Brooklyn Law School. He graduated from the University of California, Davis.

He is the son of Joan M. Means and P. Richard Means of Pleasant Hill, Calif. The bridegroom’s mother is an adjunct professor of early childhood education at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill and at Solano Community College in Fairfield, Calif. His father is the general manager of the Keys Condominium Owners Association in Walnut Creek, Calif.
34 2010-01-03 The Department of Labor’s time-use surveys show a similar trend: compared with 2005, Americans spent less time in 2008 buying goods and services and more time cooking or taking part in “organizational, civic and religious activities.”

Just as tellingly, evidence can also be found in culture. While one new study shows that attendance at museums and cultural events dropped from 2002 to 2008, it has climbed in 2009 at many major institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the . Movie attendance was also up 5 percent in 2009, and in the world of the , product sales have declined as the company’s theme parks enjoyed a 3 percent increase in visitors last quarter.

Even here in , a city famous for its materialism, retailers are hurting while audiences continue to grow at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, at parks and for cheap activities like by the beach.

“It’s a different kind of recession,” said Richard Florida, the author of several best-selling books about the economics of cities. “It’s not like in the ’30s when people stopped going to concerts. Now people seem to be keeping up with experience consumption and cutting back on other necessities.”

Psychologists have been saying for years that shared experiences like vacations lead to more long-term happiness than the latest bauble. And perhaps the change was inevitable — to be expected when a shopping-spree nation trades a glut of for layoffs and furloughs.

“Part of it is cyclical,” said Scott Hoyt, senior director of consumer economics for Moody’s Economy.com. “They have less money, so they’ll spend less time and money shopping, whether they want to or not.”

Still, the New York Times/CBS News poll — a telephone survey of 855 adults, conducted Nov. 6 to Nov. 8, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points — found that the shift spanned income brackets. And in interviews, many Americans described motives beyond pure economic necessity.

Barbara Koricanek, 73, a retired nurse in rural , said she cut back on shopping after a recent mission trip to made her realize that “we don’t need half of what we got.” Over the past few months, Ms. Koricanek has started purging her closets and baking bread from scratch, partly because it tastes better, she said, partly to become more independent.

“We cannot rely on money and the banking system and government to come up with all the answers,” she said. “People years ago were more self-reliant and were more able to take hold of the reins and do things themselves. I think we need to get back some of those basics.”

Many young people, experiencing their first economic downturn, are also making different choices. Megan Stallings, 25, an analyst in , N.C., said she first learned to value experiences while studying abroad in college, when the dollar was weak and trips brought her better memories than souvenirs. Now, she said, she spaces out her shopping trips to preserve time for activities. She has even studied how stores organize displays to make people buy more than they need.

“That awareness has saved me a lot of money,” she said. “Now I am having fun working on projects around my house, even if it is just pulling weeds or taking my dog, Amos, for a long walk.”

Those with diminished incomes described activities in slightly different terms: as a distraction from financial fear. Some, like Rebecca Heverin, 57, a former tollbooth collector in who now lives on disability payments, have hunkered down with hobbies. Ms. Heverin said she worked on her doll collection at home instead of accepting dinner invitations from neighbors because “it’s kind of embarrassing to be struggling.”

Others have been desperate to get out of the house, though in many cases, what began as psychic necessity ended with deep appreciation. Rosa Claudio, 47, of , said that since her husband was laid off from his job in construction last year, she and several relatives had made a family ritual out of going to museums. “It’s something we can do for free,” she said. “It’s enjoyable.”

The Montoyas, meanwhile, likened canoeing to therapy. “When you’re out there in the water,” Mr. Montoya said, “you can think about things openly and freely,”

Only a few years ago, Mr. Montoya and his wife — who worked as a freelance wardrobe stylist, mainly for — had enough disposable income to spend up to $1,000 a month on designer clothes for themselves and their children, Camila, , and Diego, 6. But after major advertising cutbacks last year, work practically disappeared. Their lives, they said, were thrown into reverse.

First, they told their children that “we can’t spend money every day” and that they were living on savings and family help. Then they started camping more. And as they hatched plans to start a catering business in the spring, Mr. Montoya discovered a used canoe on .

He talked the seller down to $150, from $200. “Money is tight,” Mr. Montoya said, as he packed a picnic in the boat on a recent Saturday morning. “But it’s worth it.”

There are, of course, potential problems as the drops old habits of consumption. On the macro level, economists worry that it could undermine a recovery. And the shift may be temporary: holiday shopping appears to have increased a little in 2009.

But in many homes today, experiences have become a more valued element of life. Mr. Hoyt, at , said that the behavioral changes were likely to be less transformative than what followed the Depression but that after three decades when consumer spending outpaced gross domestic product, the end of a spendthrift era may be here.

Camila Montoya said that even teenagers were now wearing old clothes longer. And for Christmas this year, she said she wanted something different and a little more hands-on: a camera.

Her parents gave in only after finding a discount they could afford.

“It’s the only present that she got,” said Mrs. Montoya, 43. “We didn’t want to spend too much money on someone who is 13 years old.”
35 2010-01-03 “At one point I said ‘I have nothing to lose, I’m the one coming from behind’ and I definitely enjoyed it,” Cirstea added.

Hewitt said he had not played in three months, “so the first match of the new year was always going to be tough.”

“Victor’s an extremely tough player, he likes to dictate play from the back of the court and he served extremely well close to the line, so it was hard for me to get any rhythm against him,” Hewitt said. “But I’m glad the match went three sets because I got better as the match got on.”

The American team, represented by the United States Open quarterfinalist Melanie Oudin and John Isner, plays Maria José Martínez Sánchez and Tommy Robredo of Spain in the only match Sunday indoors at the Burswood Dome.

Britain, with Andy Murray and Laura Robson, plays its first match Monday against Kazakhstan. Germany takes on Russia, also on Monday.

Australia, Spain, Romania and the United States are in Group A. Russia, Britain, Germany and Kazakhstan make up Group B. The winners of each group play in next Saturday’s final.

SHARAPOVA WINS EXHIBITION Maria Sharapova outplayed an error-prone Venus Williams to take a 6-3, 6-4 victory in an exhibition match in Hua Hin, Thailand.

In a warm-up ahead of this month’s Australian Open, Sharapova converted 75 percent of her break points, compared with 13 percent by Williams.

Both players appeared in trouble in the basking heat and low sun, but Williams particularly struggled to keep the ball in play.

Sharapova, ranked No. 14 in the world, displayed a solid baseline game in putting away Williams in 1 hour 34 minutes and recording her first win against her since 2007.

Sharapova broke Williams three times to take the first set in 49 minutes. The second set was on serve until the final game, when Williams missed two forehands to lose the match.

“It’s good to be back; I’m glad to play against Venus in my first match of the year,” Sharapova said.

Williams, who is chasing her first Australian Open title, acknowledged she was a little off the pace after the off-season.

“Maria played so well,” Williams said. “I was slow in my first match of the season. It’s good to be here hitting the ball.”

NADAL BEATS SODERLING Rafael Nadal ended a two-match losing streak to Robin Soderling, winning, 7-6 (3), 7-5, in the final of the season-opening Capitala exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Both players held serve throughout the first set before the second-ranked Nadal won the tie breaker. Nadal then broke decisively in the sixth game of the second set at Zayed Sports City.

Soderling ended Nadal’s 31-game unbeaten run on clay at the French Open last year and beat him again at the season-sending ATP Tour World Finals in London.

Nadal said overtaking Federer was not his main focus for 2010.

“Everybody wants the No. 1 ranking, but, believe me, for me it is not my goal for this year,” the Spaniard said. “To play competitively throughout and win as many tournaments as I can, that is my goal.”

Nadal will play in this week’s Qatar Open, the Australian Open beginning Jan. 18 and the ABN AMRO starting Feb. 8 in the Netherlands before taking a break. He injured both knees and his abdomen last season, missing Wimbledon among other tournaments.

“After the end of the season, I didn’t stop and practiced for two and a half weeks,” Nadal said. “I hope to have good tournaments in Doha, Australia and Rotterdam, and then have three weeks off because I have to rest a little in order to play the American season and play many seasons afterwards.”

Soderling was the more aggressive of the two in the opening set. Facing two break points at 5-5 in the first set, Soderling pulled through with the help of some big first serves.

Nadal then saved two set points from 15-40 down in the next game before forcing the tie breaker. Soderling needed to save another break point to avoid going down by 1-3 in the second set before pulling even at 2-2.

But two games later he handed Nadal two break points with a weak volley at the net and Nadal banked the second of these when Soderling hit wide. The door was wide for Nadal, but Soderling broke back in the next game, pulling even at 4-4.

Two games later, Soderling saved three match points with an angled volley to get to 5-5, but Nadal won the next two games to finish the match.
36 2010-01-03 Party-switchers have fared better in the Senate, though of , who defected to the Democrats after his vote for the economic stimulus bill proved unpopular back home, is facing re-election challenges from both the right and the left.

Mr. Griffith, the first-term lawmaker who signed on with Republicans last month, can probably relate to Mr. Forbes at the moment. He has outraged Democratic colleagues who cannot fathom that he jumped ship less than a year into his first term after the party invested in his initial election. Democrats are casting about for a top-tier opponent for their ex-candidate.

At the same time, some Republicans in are not eager to have Mr. Griffith as a new member of their club, saying his regular votes for Democratic initiatives — not to mention his supporting for speaker at the start of 2009 — show that he is not conservative enough at a time when the party is looking for true-blue Republicans.

Party strategists in say they expect Mr. Griffith to hang on in his district and become a dependable Republican vote, even though he is taking a pounding at the moment. They say that his decision to abandon the majority party shows just how frustrated conservative and centrist Democrats are with their party’s direction. They hope to persuade a few more to cross the aisle.

“Nancy Pelosi’s decision to move her extreme agenda against the will of the American people has alienated a number of members within her own caucus to the point they are opting for or even willing to switch parties,” said Ken , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.

If they are able to bag another Democrat or two, Republicans could claim a sense of momentum as they enter 2010, a welcome shift for them after losing the last two special House elections. And they have made some interesting overtures, with Senator of reaching out to Representative Christopher Carney of Pennsylvania, a Democrat and fellow naval officer, to ask him to consider a change.

But party-switching is a delicate and typically secretive process, and the first move usually has to come from the switcher. Republicans risk losing potential conquests if they get too aggressive and public. And despite obvious unrest among more-conservative Democrats about the difficult environment lying ahead in the midterm elections, only the most optimistic Republicans anticipate a wave of defections.

But Mr. Griffith’s move, which came after a poll showed him in re-election trouble, certainly caught the attention of Democrats. They moved quickly to take the temperature of other House Democrats considered potential Republican targets, including Representatives Bobby Bright, Mr. Griffith’s fellow Alabamian; Travis W. Childers of ; and Walt Minnick of . Along with Mr. Carney, the Democrats indicated they were not contemplating a change.

Representative Chris Van Hollen of , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he believed that Mr. Griffith could have won re-election as a Democrat and that the lawmaker miscalculated. He does not anticipate more desertions.

“People don’t like finger-to-the-wind politicians,” Mr. Van Hollen said. “I am very confident that we are not going to see any more people switching parties.”

Mr. Forbes remains comfortable with his move and noted that even some Republican friends who ostracized him at the time eventually came around. But his advice on party-switching is to make the decision based on true philosophical reasons, not political expediency.

“I thought about it for more than a year, and intensely for more than six months,” Mr. Forbes said, recalling his deliberations. “And I was probably naïve to believe some factions were not going to be as hostile as they ended up being. It was rough.

“But my life has gone in a direction now that basically confirms every day that it was the right decision for me.”
37 2010-01-03 William Beavers, a county board commissioner from the South Side, was once among Mayor Daley’s key City Council allies and is now one of the relatively few longtime backers who have remained loyal to Mr. Stroger.

“I think the mayor thinks that Todd is dead, but he doesn’t want to be the one that killed him,” Mr. Beavers said. “There might be a backlash if the mayor totally dissed Todd after all that John Stroger did for the Daleys.”

John Stroger, Todd Stroger’s father, was the county board president from 1994 to 2006 and was loyal to the Daleys for almost half a century. The current mayor’s father and predecessor, Richard J. Daley, gave John Stroger his start by helping him become Eighth Ward Democratic committeeman in 1968, Todd Stroger said in a recent interview.

The bond between the families grew closer even after Richard J. Daley died. In the 1983 mayoral primary, John Stroger endorsed Richard M. Daley in his failed run against Mayor Jane Byrne and the eventual winner, Harold Washington, Chicago’s first black mayor. John Stroger also helped the younger Mr. Daley when he became mayor in 1989 and in his re-election campaigns. After becoming county board president in 1994, John Stroger deferred to Mayor Daley and worked closely with John Daley, the mayor’s brother, who is chairman of the county board’s finance committee.

Mr. Daley and every other major Democrat supported John Stroger again as he won the party’s nomination in 2006, despite suffering a debilitating stroke shortly before that primary. Soon after Mr. Stroger’s primary victory, party leaders anointed his son to replace him as the nominee, and the younger Stroger won the November 2006 general election in the heavily Democratic county.

But earlier this year, the Daleys rescinded their support for Mr. Stroger’s 1 percent increase in the sales tax. They said the increase was hurting business in the county, and the county board recently forced through legislation that rolls back half of the increase.

Within minutes of that vote, Mr. Stroger gave an interview to the Chicago News Cooperative in which he blasted the Daleys for their lack of support.

John Daley said that he and Mr. Stroger did not have the same sort of bond he enjoyed with John Stroger, who died in January 2008. But he said the Daley family’s rupture with the Strogers “has been blown out of proportion.”

“He has his own friends,” John Daley said, adding, “You can’t just expect the endorsement. You have to reach out to everyone and talk to the people about it.”

The mayor heatedly rebutted the county board president’s accusation that his lack of support was a slap in the face to Mr. Stroger. “I never slapped anybody in the face,” Mr. Daley said to reporters last month. “Even symbolically, I haven’t. How does he know he doesn’t have my support?”

Asked if he would indeed support Mr. Stroger after all, Mr. Daley said, “No, I didn’t say that.”

Also professing neutrality is the speaker of the State House, Michael J. Madigan, Democrat of Chicago, and the only other politician in the state whose influence can come close to Mr. Daley’s. Their public stances have only fueled rumors that the mayor and Mr. Madigan are secretly aiding other candidates.

Toni Preckwinkle, the 4th Ward alderman, has been coy about her efforts to gain the mayor’s backing. “He came to a fund-raiser that one of his friends had for me,” Ms. Preckwinkle said. “That was helpful.”

Pressed to name the mayoral friend, she interrupted the interview and asked her aides, “Am I at liberty to say?” She concluded that she would not reveal the name.

Ms. Preckwinkle, who is black, has the most cross-racial support of any of the candidates, with endorsements from Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, as well as Democratic organizations in such largely white suburban townships as New Trier and Northfield.

But the early front-runner in newspaper and campaign polls is Dorothy Brown, clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court. Mrs. Brown was first elected in 2000 after winning the Democratic nomination over the officially sanctioned candidate.

Mrs. Brown garnered little support in a 2007 challenge to Mayor Daley. She is getting help in this campaign from Fred Moody, a longtime political supporter of Mr. Madigan and a high-ranking manager in the clerk’s office.

“I am the only real independent in this race,” said Mrs. Brown, who also is black.

Mr. O’Brien, president of the water district, has received the backing of almost all of Mr. Daley’s most important white and Hispanic allies, including the Democratic organizations in the 19th, 23rd, 25th, 33rd, 36th, 38th, 40th, 45th and 50th Wards.

This led Mr. Stroger to assert that the three black candidates could divide black support, which makes up about 40 percent of the primary vote, and clear the way for Mr. O’Brien to win.

Mr. O’Brien said he had helped Mr. Daley as far back as his 1979 race for Cook County state’s attorney. Mr. O’Brien’s senior strategist is Thomas Manion, the City Hall lobbyist who once was a top aide in the mayor’s re-election campaign.

But Mr. O’Brien and Mr. Manion said this did not mean that Mr. Daley was backing Mr. O’Brien.

“All of the Daley guys with us are there because they like Terry,” Mr. Manion said. “They’re not there because the mayor cleared it, like in the old days.”

Mr. Daley has stayed out of the fray in the important local primaries since the 2006 conviction of his patronage chief, Robert Sorich, and the subsequent decline of the campaign armies that worked for his endorsed candidates.

Candidates with little establishment backing won both the March 2009 special primary for a seat in Congress and the 2008 primary for Cook County state’s attorney. The mayor did not issue an endorsement in either of those primaries. The victors squeaked by against multiple rivals, winning with relatively small pluralities of only about a quarter of the vote.

John Daley, who is also party chairman in the family’s 11th Ward power base, said the influence of the local machine had been greatly exaggerated. He then issued a surprising call for something that would have been heresy in his father’s day: the end to all official endorsements by party leaders.

“I’m to the point where I believe we should do open primaries for any race,” he said. “The voters will decide.”
38 2010-01-03 FOR two years motorists on Route 25A in Huntington could see the transformation of the former Empire Szechuan into the dazzling Dao, which opened in August.

The lavishly decorated exterior has Japanese gardens with rocks, waterfalls, bonsai and fish ponds. The interior is equally elaborate. Diners first see a marble-topped, backlighted bar in a lounge area with circular leather booths and a baby grand player piano (which can be heard throughout the restaurant). Overhead is a glittery gold ceiling made of glass and stone tiles. The rest of the restaurant features four massive crystal chandeliers, marble columns, a tropical fish tank and pale marble floors.

On a takeout menu I picked up in August, the food was labeled “Fine Asian Fusion.” A more recent menu changed that to “Modern Asian Cuisine.” There are a few fusion dishes, like the Caesar salad, but a majority of offerings reflect a pan-Asian approach: Peking duck is listed alongside Japanese gyoza and sushi, pad Thai and Vietnamese pork chops.

The food at Dao is mixed in quality as well as in its national origins. You can skip that Caesar salad. The lettuce is mixed greens, not romaine, and any taste of Parmesan cheese is masked by a sweet yuzu tofu dressing. Garnishes of pineapple cubes and orange segments made the salad even more cloying.

Rock shrimp tempura was another dish to miss. The small pile of crustaceans was neither crisp nor spicy, and the dipping sauces — green tea aioli and a “spicy creamy sauce” — were bland. We liked the filling in the chicken lettuce wraps, a takeoff on chicken soong, but the use of Boston rather than iceberg lettuce kept the dish from being properly crunchy.
39 2010-01-03 But I keep coming back to the crisis of relevance that the events of 9/11 stirred. In retrospect, that challenge was beneficial. In a country where popular culture is omnipresent and powerful, opera companies, orchestras and chamber ensembles have to combat the perception that classical music is elitist and inaccessible. These issues had been developing years before 9/11.

In its aftermath many classical music artists and institutions found ways to respond. Maybe I am making too much of 9/11 as a prod to this self-examination and renewal. But what seems indisputable is that outreach and education programs have become central to the missions of many artists and institutions.

In 2007, when Carnegie Hall presented the Berlin Philharmonic as the centerpiece of its festival Berlin in Lights, the players performed chamber music in schools and communities around New York. This initiative was an outgrowth of an education program in Berlin, established by Simon Rattle after he became that venerable orchestra’s principal conductor in 2002, determined to take it into the 21st century.

For me the highlight of the festival came when 110 New York schoolchildren, working with a choreographer and Berlin Philharmonic educators, performed an original ballet to Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” at the United Palace Theater in Washington Heights, a former movie house, now a church and concert hall. The pit band was the Berlin Philharmonic, no less, conducted by Mr. Rattle.

A year later, in a follow-up project sponsored by Carnegie Hall, Marin Alsop, the music director of the Baltimore Symphony, took her orchestra to the United Palace to perform Bernstein’s “Mass,” abetted by a chorus of some 250 New York schoolchildren. A racially diverse audience packed the place and broke into ovations. Just as with Mr. Rattle’s “Rite,” I took it all in and thought: Something new is going on.

Perhaps Ms. Alsop’s background as a woman in the overwhelmingly male field of conducting has made her a natural at education. She has been forced to change minds all her life. And unlike many complaining musicians, she accepts the responsibility of reaching new audiences. “We have to forget about blaming the education system for the lack of music in the public schools,” she said in a 2007 interview. “We have to be the leaders on this.”

That other prominent musicians increasingly agreed and took action was a hallmark of the decade. Since the death of Leonard Bernstein, the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas has been America’s most charismatic music teacher. In recent years, using his post as music director of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, he has taken his campaign to television and the Internet through the impressive Keeping Score programs.

Then there is Gustavo Dudamel. One of the most auspicious events for classical music in recent years came on a sunny Saturday at the Hollywood Bowl in early October, during the all-day festivities to celebrate Mr. Dudamel’s arrival as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Before conducting the orchestra in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, Mr. Dudamel led a performance with the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, the training ensemble that the Philharmonic, inspired by Mr. Dudamel, inaugurated two years ago. The young players, drawn mostly from South Central neighborhoods and mostly from minorities, sawed through an arrangement of Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” as 18,000 people — including their proud families, seated prominently in the front rows — listened and cheered.

Mr. Dudamel is a product of El Sistema, Venezuela’s nationwide youth music program. Replicating that program in Los Angeles is central to how he sees his mission with the Philharmonic.

Over the last 10 years the New York Philharmonic was nowhere near as innovative as the two West Coast orchestras. Kurt Masur had his heart in the right place. But his most admirable quality as an artist — his conviction that great music is ennobling — also limited his imagination. Orchestral music was serious business to Mr. Masur. Rectitude emanated from his Beethoven performances. Devising exploratory programs and fostering young composers were never his strengths. Still, when a profound statement was called for, Mr. Masur was your man. I will never forget the memorial concert he conducted in late September 2001 for victims of 9/11, a magnificently restrained account of Brahms’s “German Requiem.”

At the start of his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic in 2002, Lorin Maazel conducted the premiere of a work that grappled directly with 9/11, “On the Transmigration of Souls,” by John Adams. The piece, for which Mr. Adams won the Pulitzer Prize, was less a formal musical composition than a “memory space,” to quote Mr. Adams, in which taped sounds of city life and traffic, phrases from personal letters and victims’ names are folded into a hauntingly atmospheric musical score.

Over time, however, it became clear that Mr. Maazel’s great failure as music director was his abdication of the role of cultural leader and educator. A sure sign that Alan Gilbert was going to embrace that role came in the summer of 2008, a year before he took charge, when he conducted the Philharmonic in Central Park for the first time. As a child he used to hang out at parks concerts with his parents, both Philharmonic violinists. He was elated to find himself on the makeshift podium. His first concert at Central Park this summer drew 80,000 people.

His initiatives so far include appointing a composer in residence, Magnus Lindberg, and inaugurating Contact!, a series of programs of contemporary music for chamber orchestra at halls outside Lincoln Center. The Philharmonic is not about to install a youth orchestra. But for an institution that was behind the curve for a decade, it is catching up fast.

Carnegie Hall was deeply involved in education long before Clive Gillinson became its executive and artistic director in 2005. But early on, Mr. Gillinson met with Joseph W. Polisi, the president of the Juilliard School, to formulate an innovative program that embodied the dual goals of relevance and responsibility.

That program, the Academy, run by Carnegie and its Weill Music Institute, Juilliard and the New York City Education Department, brings together top-notch postgraduate musicians who receive training and perform concerts. The participants also filter into the city’s public schools, where they work with students.

The program is founded on the principle that it is not enough today to be a terrific performer. A musician must be able to connect with people and take music outside the concert hall. The goal is not necessarily to direct members into public school teaching but to make them good musical citizens.

Mr. Polisi says the Academy can cultivate attractive candidates for professional ensembles. If an orchestra has an opening, rather than just recruiting the “best” violinist (however such a thing is measured), the committee might just go for an exceptional violinist with proven skills at engaging the public and the young.

It is too early to assess the program’s long-term impact. For now the Academy musicians are presenting adventurous concerts, most recently at Le Poisson Rouge, the hip nightclub for all kinds of contemporary music in Greenwich Village, whose very existence heralds a new paradigm for reaching young audiences.

Outreach can take many forms. Opera buffs may quibble about Peter Gelb’s artistic vision for the Metropolitan Opera since he became general manager in 2006. But he jolted the opera world with the Met’s high-definition broadcasts, which carry live performances to movie theaters nationwide. No other innovation since supertitles has done more to make opera accessible. Companies everywhere, from La Scala in Milan to the San Francisco Opera, are following suit.

The decade has ended with an encouraging story of perseverance. A year ago City Opera, the “people’s opera,” came close to going under. With a new leader, a refocused mission, a renovated house and a couple of innovative productions, it has returned. How fitting that the musical decade in New York was more or less framed by the City Opera, beginning with that brave opening day in 2001.
40 2010-01-03 The apartments run between $1.325 million and $10.75 million; a round of price cuts in April ranging from 6 to 14 percent brought the building to its current numbers.

The Chelsea Enclave opened for advance sales on Sept. 15, 2008, the day Lehman Brothers collapsed and the economy went into a tailspin. In addition to that painfully bad timing, the building was still under construction, and potential buyers had to content themselves with renderings and models. In recent years, plans and pretty pictures used to be enough for deals to go forward. Not anymore.

“Buyers literally refuse to buy in presales,” Mr. Lansill said. “People just don’t believe the lobby is going to be nice, they don’t believe that the apartments are going to have good finishes until they see it.”

Now, however, there are things to see and tires to kick. In the last three months, since around the time the lobby was finished and model apartments were available for show, six apartments have sold. That brings the total of apartments in contract up to 13, with another unit closed and one contract pending.

This project, like almost all new construction, is in a difficult position: Until a certain percentage of apartments have sold, many banks are unwilling to make loans to people who want to buy there.

“It’s a little bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,” said Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage. “In order to get the deals done, you need to get buyers into the building. But banks have been hesitant to let buyers into the building.”

Nonetheless, Ms. Cohn says, some lenders are willing to take the plunge on this project — she arranged one of the sales in the building herself — though they demand a higher interest rate.

Slow presales have not been the only hitch at the Chelsea Enclave. The proposed size of the building caused quite a stir in the planning stages a few years ago.

Originally, the seminary and the project’s developer, the Brodsky Organization, envisioned a 17-story building replacing a mid-20th-century building called Sherrill Hall.

A building that tall, however, required special approval, because this part of Chelsea has a height restriction of 75 feet. The proposed skyscraper hit stiff resistance from the community board and local politicians.

“They came forward with this out-of-scale building,” State Senator Tom Duane said. “This is the core of not just the historic district, but of the whole neighborhood. We fought them and we won.”

Eventually, the Brodsky Organization and the seminary settled for the standard seven-story limit and signed a land lease for 99 years and about $30 million, paid upfront.

Though sales are slow, construction continues on schedule. And if it takes years to sell the entire building?

“So be it,” said Daniel Brodksy, a managing partner at the Brodsky Organization. “Our family has been in the real estate business for three generations, and we’ve never dropped a project. We’ve lived through great markets and through lousy markets. We’ve always held onto our buildings.”
41 2010-01-03 The Right Hand of the Fathers

It is clear to me on reading David D. Kirkpatrick’s article that Robert P. George has hijacked the word “reason” to suit the beliefs and purposes of the group of Catholic bishops who espouse his philosophical dogma. Recognizing reality is a better guide toward truth. As Louis Pasteur once said, “The greatest derangement of the mind is to believe in something because one wishes it to be so.”

As a Catholic who has spent his life serving the poor, I am dismayed at the right-wing politicization of the American bishops, exemplified by their reliance on the advice of folks like Robert George. I am a firm believer in the church lifting up its prophetic voice. As I understand the Gospel, though, it should be a voice speaking truth to power across the board and protecting the poor and powerless. The bishops’ voice, in my view, is not that of the Gospel nor that of broad Catholic teaching. Abortion is an issue, to be sure, but it is only one of many critical life issues. The bishops do not show leadership against war, poverty, gross capitalism or institutional structures of oppression, as did Jesus. Whenever they do speak on those matters, it is only with pious platitudes. They have become too ensconced in comfortable living and in the corridors of privilege. For myself, I can reject their misdirection and speak truth to their power. What pains me, though, is how they have driven so many from the church. I see this in my own children, whom I did my best to raise devoutly. When they came of age and compared the current Catholic leadership with the life of Jesus, they, like so many younger adults, saw little value in the bishops’ example and drifted from the church.

By tethering marriage rights to procreation, Robert George betrays the flaws in his circular reasoning against same-sex marriage: arguing that gay pairs shouldn’t be allowed to wed because they can’t procreate would also disqualify infertile straight pairs. George’s retort is that these couples should still be able to wed because “people who can practice baseball can be teammates without victories on the field.” Yet that reasoning should apply equally to gays — unless you’ve already deemed homosexuality immoral and hence a disqualifying trait. George worries that the biggest error in his thinking may be an undue faith in reason. His thinking is certainly faith-based, but it’s anything but reasonable.

Whether he grounds his conclusions in the Bible or in so-called “practical reason,” Robert George’s opposition to feminism, homosexuality, multiculturalism and a lifestyle based on freedom of choice sounds remarkably like the tenets of the Taliban.
42 2010-01-03 WHEN Adam Krueckeberg, 37, decided to leave his job as a vice president at Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, to return to school for an M.B.A., he didn’t look at top-ranked schools like Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, although his résumé was stellar and his scores strong. The only place that interested him was Boston College, the Jesuit-run institution that has been offering a dual M.B.A./M.S. in church management and pastoral ministry since 2005.

“I wanted a career that was more spiritually fulfilling,” says Mr. Krueckeberg, who plans to work in a Catholic diocese or university when he graduates, in 2012. “I wouldn’t have been able to train for that in a more traditional setting.”

The trend toward specialization has crept into most fields over the past few decades, but few have embraced the shift more enthusiastically than graduate schools of business. Since 1990, the year that the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, the main accreditation board for business schools, changed its guidelines to encourage innovative curriculums, schools have focused on areas like aerospace, wine management, luxury goods, real estate and energy management.

The percentage of business school students enrolled in specialized programs has risen about 4 percent each year since 2001, according to Daniel R. LeClair, the organization’s vice president for knowledge services. More than a fifth of business school students are now seeking such degrees.

Instead of exposing them to theory or the big picture of their discipline, specialized programs tend to zero in on practical and commercial applications. It’s an approach more likely to be seen outside the top tier of M.B.A. programs. Institutions like the University of Chicago and Columbia, whose graduates are much sought-after, have mostly kept the general M.B.A., with broad areas of concentration like finance and marketing. But for many others, specialization is a way to stand out among the more than 500 accredited programs here and abroad.

“If you’re not one of those few obvious schools, you need to be able to offer students and employers real depth,” says Blair Sanford, assistant dean and director of M.B.A. career services at the business school at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, which enrolls about 125 students a year.

64 2010-01-04 “Everyone is getting ready to cleanse themselves for the New Year,” said Jason Mizrahi, a co-owner of the company, which was started in 1959 by his father, the son of Sephardic Jews who emigrated from Turkey. The business, which fills a former A.&P. supermarket on Webster Avenue near Fordham University, claims to be the largest botanica on the East Coast.

A veritable Home Depot of spirituality, its brightly lighted aisles teem with hundreds of varieties of candles, oils, perfumes, cleaning liquids, air fresheners and incense powders, offering solutions fine-tuned for a host of specific problems.

Someone put a hex on you? There are Jinx Removing and Spell Breaker oils. Haunted by spirits? Try the Go Away Evil bath salts or Run Devil Run floor soap. Broke and destitute? Buy some Bad Luck Out, Good Luck In oil and freshen up the house with Mr. Money aerosol spray. No one to love? Bathe with Attraction soap, dab on some Come to Me perfume and light a Tame Him candle, perhaps coated with Dragon’s Blood oil to boost the potency of the charm.

An entire aisle is devoted to statuary, from four-inch-tall dashboard figurines of St. Anthony and St. Barbara to a three-foot-tall Grim Reaper molded in translucent plastic. An herbs and roots department sells scores of preparations for teas and baths, including mugwort, devil’s shoestring and wahoo bark. There are voodoo-doll pincushions and a bookstore.

The store was hopping one afternoon last week, its sound system blasting salsa. The patrons were mainly Caribbean Latinos — Dominican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans — though they included Haitians and African-Americans.

Ricelly Veloz, 24, a Dominican-American from the Bronx, was clutching a shopping list and looking harried. “Where can I find Dinero Rapido?” she asked an employee, seeking a product whose name means quick cash. “I’ve been here an hour already and I can’t find it.”

She was with her sister, Stacy, 18, and their cart was filling up with New Year’s preparations. Ricelly Veloz, a health insurance marketer, had bought several innocuous-sounding oils and bath soaps including Rose, Love, Sunflower and Patchouli — for year-end cleansing, she said. Her sister’s oils and soaps seemed more strategic: Spell Breaker, Attractive, Wall Breaker and Unleash the Power.

But quick cash was nowhere to be found. The employee recommended mixing Money Drawing and Fast Luck. The Veloz sisters looked unconvinced and took a pass.

Mr. Mizrahi says the company takes in about $3 million each year from sales through its store, Web site (originalprodcorp.com), catalog and distribution to scores of smaller botanicas all over the world. Its largest customer is a distributor in Holland that buys at least one 40-foot shipping container full of goods every year, said Mr. Mizrahi, 34, who took over the business a dozen years ago and owns it with his cousin Steve Amateau, 51, a former television producer.

In a basement workshop, employees make many of the products. The company has turned over the second floor, rent free, to the Pagan Center of New York, which holds witchcraft rituals overseen by a Wiccan high priestess named Lady Rhea.

Mr. Mizrahi does not follow any of the faiths his store provides for, but said he subscribed to the “concept of spirituality and keeping a positive attitude by using these products.”

“These things are daily needs, staples,” he continued. “Milk, eggs, bread, incense, candles, in that order. Sometimes incense and candles are ahead of milk and eggs, on a day like today.”

His longest-serving employee, Anthony Lopez, who joined the company in 1974, described himself as “an underpaid therapist.”

“Any problem they have, they come here,” he said. “And then they go to the doctor.”

“Maybe they go to the doctor,” Mr. Mizrahi interjected.

He told a story. “I had a lady come in here one time and tell me, ‘My son thinks he’s a snake.’ I say, ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I put the food down on the ground and he slithers along the floor and darts his tongue in and out of his mouth.’ I gave her something to put in his shoes.”

Another story: “Guy asked me — this was on the telephone — ‘Do you sell iron pots?’ ‘Yes, we sell iron pots.’ ‘Do you sell large pots?’ ‘Yes, we do.’ ‘How large?’ ‘Well, how large do you need?’ ‘Big enough to fit a person?’ ”

Mr. Mizrahi paused to let the punch line sink in. “I may get something like that once a week,” he said.

A middle-aged man carrying a box walked into the store. He is a regular supplier of objects used in Santería rituals. “What do you got?” Mr. Mizrahi asked.

“Coyote skulls,” the man replied. He pulled a dozen, one at a time, from the box and carefully inspected the teeth. If any were missing, he said, “it’s a different price point.”

Several minutes later, the man was gone and the skulls were lined up on a shelf in the Santería section with price tags stuck to their snouts ($60 each). Nearby were peacock feathers, horseshoes, dried scorpions and dead vampire bats in plastic bags.

A short plump man missing half his teeth approached the counter to speak with Mr. Allai, the Santería priest. The man said he had been suffering pain and heat flashes for several years and suspected he was haunted by bad spirits.

“They speak to me,” he said. “My wife doesn’t believe me.” He suddenly flinched — spirits moving under the skin again, he explained.

He said he did not need to see a doctor. “I don’t have a medical problem,” he insisted. “It’s something spiritual.”

Mr. Allai, 70, had seen this customer many times. And as before, he recommended herb-infused baths. The man loaded his shopping basket with herbs, added a red good-luck candle called La Madama — “Maybe it gives me protection,” he said — and hustled toward the cash register.

95 2010-01-05 Punter Kyle Brotzman hit the wide-open tight end Kyle Efaw for a 29-yard gain. Brotzman jokingly throws with the Boise quarterbacks every Thursday, and if he had misfired T.C.U. would have been on the doorstep of a landmark victory. Instead, Boise’s legend of trickery, and the program’s reputation, only bloomed.

“It’s gutsy,” said T.C.U.’s Tanner Brock, who was on the Horned Frogs’ stunned punt defense. “That’s what Boise State is. They’re going to pull out the trick plays here, there and everywhere.”

Four plays later, Boise State scored its only offensive touchdown of the game with some unmistakable Bronco flair. Tailback Doug Martin flipped over a T.C.U. defender from 2 yards out to give Boise a 17-10 lead.

Efaw, the game’s offensive most valuable player, summed up the feeling in the Boise locker room.

“That’s a gutsy play call,” he said. “I’m glad it worked.

The Broncos’ victory was their second in a Bowl Championship Series game. In the B.C.S.’s 11-year history, that is the same total as Alabama, Michigan and Penn State combined.

The victory also gave Boise a chance to reside alongside the national elite programs. By finishing the season 14-0 and with a spot in the top five all but guaranteed, Boise State is on the cusp of something unthinkable even three years ago. The Broncos, whose last defeat came against T.C.U., 17-16, in the Poinsettia Bowl in December 2008, became the second team in modern history to go 14-0, joining Ohio State in 2002.

The Broncos return 21 of 22 starters next year, and are nearly two-deep at most positions as they had only four seniors on their roster.

Boise State should be in position in the preseason polls to play for the national title next year. That is significant, because poll position can make all the difference if there are few upsets among the top teams.

“Its something we can build on at this point,” Boise quarterback Kellen Moore said. “Hopefully make some progress in spring ball with all those opportunities, and something might happen down the road.”

Although the trick plays will be the legacy of Boise’s Fiesta Bowl victories, the big picture of the Boise program should not be lost. Petersen cringes when people dismiss his Broncos as a team that relies on razzle-dazzle for victory.

In fact, the in-house reverberations from Boise’s victory here three years ago came on the recruiting trail.

Top recruits like Austin Pettis, D. J. Harper and Jeremy Avery picked the Broncos over teams with more tradition.

The Boise defense, however, shined brightest Monday night. They held T.C.U. (12-1), which had the No. 4 scoring offense in the Football Bowl Subdivision, to 308 total yards. Petersen credited a 3-2-6 installed for the game that the T.C.U. coaches and players said confused them early on, especially because their radio head-set communication did not function part of the first quarter.

But Boise’s defense showed it was among the elite in college football when it mattered. In its biggest victories this season — Oregon to start and T.C.U. to finish — the physical, aggressive and sure-tackling Broncos stole the show, particularly the secondary.

Brandyn Thompson had two interceptions, including a 51-yard return for a touchdown. He also sealed the game when he tipped a pass deep in T.C.U. territory that Winston Venable intercepted.

Boise defensive back Kyle Wilson might have been the game’s best player, breaking up two passes, forcing a fumble by smashing Andy Dalton on an early blitz and topping his performance by downing a Brotzman punt on the T.C.U. 1 with just over a minute remaining.

Moore is a more traditional Boise State recruit. His only other scholarship offers came from Idaho and Eastern Washington. But he has developed into one of the best quarterbacks in college football and should be in the thick of the talk about the Heisman Trophy race next season.

Moore looked shaky early on, missing a sure touchdown on the game’s opening play and overthrowing several receivers. But he settled down when it counted. He completed three consecutive passes for a total of 36 yards after Boise’s fake punt, setting up the Broncos’ only offensive touchdown.

Moore finished 23 of 39 for 211 yards with no touchdown passes. But he managed the game like the coach’s son that he is, not throwing any interceptions and throwing the ball away often to avoid T.C.U.’s pressure. Moore did not end up with bonkers numbers, but as he has done all season, he led the Broncos to a win.

And after 14 happy endings, the Broncos program can dream even bigger. The same stage that put them into the college football elite now has them with realistic dreams of being in the running for the national title in 2010. And that, as Petersen will tell you, isn’t the result of trickery.

As for T.C.U., the Horned Frogs learned the same lesson Oklahoma did three years ago. When playing Boise, they will beat you with verve.

“Shame on us,” said T.C.U. receiver Jeremy Kerley, “for not expecting it.”
96 2010-01-05 An argument ensued, and Crittenton threatened to shoot Arenas in his knee, according to The Washington Post. Two days later, Arenas laid out three guns on a locker-room chair and indicated that Crittenton should pick one. Crittenton reacted angrily and reportedly tossed at least one of the guns to the floor.

“Joke or not, I now recognize that what I did was a mistake and was wrong,” Arenas said in his statement. “I should not have brought the guns to D.C. in the first place, and I now realize that there’s no such thing as joking around when it comes to guns — even if unloaded.”

Arenas then apologized “for the effect that my serious lapse in judgment has had on my team, my teammates, the National Basketball Association and its fans.”

It was the most extensive and most sober explanation that Arenas had offered after spending the weekend making light of the matter on his Twitter feed. The whimsical commentary was consistent with his public image as an eccentric.

It is not yet clear what consequences Arenas will face, from the authorities or the N.B.A. The league is waiting for the legal process to play out before deciding on disciplinary measures. Arenas has not been arrested and continues to play and practice with the Wizards.

The District of Columbia has some of the nation’s strictest gun-control laws and generally bans carrying firearms in public. But if Arenas’s version of events is true, he would face a much lighter penalty than if the guns had been loaded or used to threaten someone.

Any penalty could depend on whether the authorities can verify Arenas’s version of events and, perhaps, whether they wish to make him an example, said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.

“It certainly looks like less egregious behavior than it did before, if he’s to be believed,” Tobias said. “So that may make the prosecutors less concerned, and the public as well. But still, if they have a technical violation, they could go forward.”

While not speaking specifically of Arenas’s situation or confirming that his office was involved in the investigation, the District of Columbia’s attorney general, Peter Nickles, said that carrying handguns in public was typically a misdemeanor offense, carrying a sentence of six months or less, depending on the person’s prior record. Within the district, Nickles’s office traditionally handles misdemeanor offenses, and the United States attorney’s office prosecutes felonies.

“There are felonies that arrive if you use it to threaten somebody or something like that,” Nickles said, adding that those sentences could include incarceration up to a decade. “That would then go to the U.S. attorney, and they would have to determine whether or not to prosecute.”

The law may allow leniency if a concealed gun is not loaded.

“You have to look at the particular facts as to the degree of threat it poses,” Nickles said. “If it’s concealed and then discovered by a policeman, it may not be a big difference. But if it’s being waved around or something, then obviously it has an impact.”
97 2010-01-05 But in deciding to change the tower’s name from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa, in honor of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Dubai revealed a rare streak of humility consistent with its diminished economic condition. Once the most proudly autonomous of Arab Emirates, Dubai has found that its financial troubles have made it more dependent on Abu Dhabi and more likely to be drawn closer into the federation.

“Dubai not only has the world’s tallest building, but has also made what looks like the most expensive naming rights deal in history,” said Jim Krane, the author of “City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism.” “Renaming the Burj Dubai after Sheik Khalifa of Abu Dhabi — if not an explicit quid pro quo — is a down payment on Dubai’s gratitude for its neighbor’s $10 billion bailout last month.”

The opening festivities had the feel of a national holiday, with fireworks, parachute jumps and shooting streams of water from the world’s tallest fountain.

At a cost estimated at $1.5 billion, the Burj took five years to build, is more than 160 floors high and has comfortably surpassed the previous record holder in , the 101.

More than 12,000 people will occupy its six million square feet, zooming up and down in 54 elevators that can reach speeds of 40 miles an hour. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in .

At a time when several of Dubai’s newly built office towers stand empty, it is 90 percent sold, according to the building’s developer, Emaar Properties.

To be sure, some have questioned the utility of such a towering project. At least three foreign workers died during the construction. And at a time of increasing concerns over global terrorism, such a building could pose an inviting target.

But to Dubai, which from its very beginning has taken pleasure in proving its doubters wrong, the Burj is evidence that if you build it big and brash enough the people will come, from near and far.

With its strong government backing and unquestioned prestige, the Burj was a project that was destined to succeed and its developer, Emaar, had little difficulty in attracting residents — particularly since much of the space was sold several years ago in the middle of Dubai’s real estate frenzy.

Other projects, however, have not been so lucky. One is the Omniyat Bayswater, a 24-story office building that stands less than half a mile from the Burj. It opened six months ago and remains more than 50 percent vacant.

Aimed to be the flagship structure of an ambitious development project in an area by the sea called Business Bay, Omniyat Bayswater has been unable to attract tenants as a consequence of the current real estate crisis.

But its struggle speaks to a larger truth behind the Dubai real estate bubble which, despite the excitement over the Burj, could well forestall a meaningful recovery.

Like many office projects developed four or five years ago, the peak years of Dubai’s expansion, the Omniyat Bayswater is plagued by splintered ownership. It is estimated to have more than 50 landlords — more than two per floor — with some trying to lease office suites as small as 1,000 square feet.

A spokesman for Omniyat said that the developer recognized the problem of multiple owners, and had taken steps to address it and expected to see whole floors leased by the second quarter of this year.

At a time when selling real estate was like handing out candy to children, the development model of selling to many owners, known as strata title, became a quick and easy way to finance building projects. Speculators from around the world were clamoring for the smallest slice of Dubai property.

But with the crash, the building’s ownership structure has made it extremely difficult to sell or lease a floor or two to foreign companies seeking to expand.

“There has been a difficulty in creating a collective of owners,” said Nick Maclean of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai. “The majority of the building is empty.”

Few offers have been made for space in buildings under strata title, which is estimated to cover about two-thirds of the new buildings opening this year and 70 percent of those opening in 2011. Without government action, office vacancy rates could rise as high as 40 percent, according to real estate analysts.

As for the effect the Burj will have on the overall market, Mr. Maclean said that its opening, while heartening, was unlikely to prompt an immediate turn around in the market.

“It is a unique building and symbolically important but it is not going to stimulate demand,” he said.
98 2010-01-05 A Credit Suisse spokesman, Duncan King, said, “We believe the suit to be without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”

Dwayne Doherty, a spokesman for Cushman & Wakefield, which provided appraisals of the property, echoed that statement. “The allegations are completely without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,” he said.

The lead lawyer in the suit, Michael J. Flynn, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., said he could not comment until the judge allowed the class action to proceed.

The suit accuses the defendants of engaging in a sweeping conspiracy that focused on the developers of the resorts. Specifically, the complaint accuses Credit Suisse and Cushman & Wakefield of racketeering, breach of fiduciary duty, mail and wire fraud, money laundering and negligence. The suit describes Credit Suisse as an “international banking predator.”

In the complaint, the plaintiffs’ lawyers contend that Credit Suisse and Cushman & Wakefield conspired by setting up a Cayman Islands branch to circumvent federal law on real estate appraisals. The complaint also alleges that they inflated the value of the resorts and made millions of dollars in fees on loans against the properties. Credit Suisse knew the resorts would most likely default under the weight of inflated values, which would allow the bank to take ownership as agent on behalf of the creditors, the suit contends.

The Yellowstone Club borrowed $375 million from Credit Suisse in 2005. After the economy began to falter, Edra Blixseth, who won control of the property in a divorce from her husband, Timothy, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2008. The property was sold to CrossHarbor Capital Partners in 2009 for $115 million, about a quarter of the estimated value of the club at the peak of the market, though Credit Suisse retained the right to collect the loan after it was sold.

In May, in the Blixseth bankruptcy case, Judge Ralph B. Kirscher of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Butte, Mont., wrote: “The naked greed in this case, combined with Credit Suisse’s complete disregard” for the developer and others, “shocks the conscience of this court.”

“While Credit Suisse’s new loan product resulted in enormous fees to Credit Suisse in 2005, it resulted in financial ruin for several residential resort communities,” he wrote. “Credit Suisse lined its pockets on the backs of the unsecured creditors.” The statement was written in a judge’s order that has since been vacated as part of a settlement agreement.

The complaint also contends that the money to finance loans came from a separate case in which Credit Suisse helped Iranian banks avoid United States sanctions by hiding profits. Credit Suisse paid the government $536 million in December to settle that case.

The suit seeks $8 billion in damages, which it says should be tripled as allowed under federal racketeering statutes.

The decline at many posh Western resorts has been stunning. Values have dropped precipitously, projects are unfinished and investor interest has waned. At the Tamarack Resort, 90 miles north of Boise, the tennis star Andre Agassi has abandoned plans to build a five-star hotel, unfinished buildings have been mothballed and Bank of America is asking a court to allow it to repossess the resort’s ski lifts. Homeowners who bought property and built homes are fuming.

In November, the new owners of the Yellowstone Club liquidated 13 tractor-trailer loads of antique furniture bought by the Blixseths, including a two-seat black walnut throne from a castle in Bavaria that Timothy Blixseth once planned to place in his 53,000-square-foot home. That home was never built.
99 2010-01-05 Every day, millions of Americans stand at store checkout counters and make a seemingly random decision: after swiping their debit card, they choose whether to punch in a code, or to sign their name.

It is a pointless distinction to most consumers, since the price is the same either way. But behind the scenes, billions of dollars are at stake.

When you sign a debit card receipt at a large retailer, the store pays your bank an average of 75 cents for every $100 spent, more than twice as much as when you punch in a four-digit code.

The difference is so large that Costco will not allow you to sign for your debit purchase in its checkout lines. Wal-Mart and Home Depot steer customers to use a PIN, the debit card norm outside the United States.

Despite all this, signature debit cards dominate debit use in this country, accounting for 61 percent of all such transactions, even though PIN debit cards are less expensive and less vulnerable to fraud.

How this came to be is largely a result of a successful if controversial strategy hatched decades ago by Visa, the dominant payment network for credit and debit cards. It is an approach that has benefited Visa and the nation’s banks at the expense of merchants and, some argue, consumers.

Competition, of course, usually forces prices lower. But for payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, competition in the card business is more about winning over banks that actually issue the cards than consumers who use them. Visa and MasterCard set the fees that merchants must pay the cardholder’s bank. And higher fees mean higher profits for banks, even if it means that merchants shift the cost to consumers.

Seizing on this odd twist, Visa enticed banks to embrace signature debit  the higher-priced method of handling debit cards  and turned over the fees to banks as an incentive to issue more Visa cards. At least initially, MasterCard and other rivals promoted PIN debit instead.

As debit cards became the preferred plastic in American wallets, Visa has turned its attention to PIN debit too and increased its market share even more. And it has succeeded  not by lowering the fees that merchants pay, but often by pushing them up, making its bank customers happier.

In an effort to catch up, MasterCard and other rivals eventually raised fees on debit cards too, sometimes higher than Visa, to try to woo bank customers back.

“What we witnessed was truly a perverse form of competition,” said Ronald Congemi, the former chief executive of Star Systems, one of the regional PIN-based networks that has struggled to compete with Visa. “They competed on the basis of raising prices. What other industry do you know that gets away with that?”

Visa has managed to dominate the debit landscape despite more than a decade of litigation and antitrust investigations into high fees and anticompetitive behavior, including a settlement in 2003 in which Visa paid $2 billion that some predicted would inject more competition into the debit industry.

Yet today, Visa has a commanding lead in signature debit in the United States, with a 73 percent share. Its share of the domestic PIN debit market is smaller but growing, at 42 percent, making Visa the biggest PIN network, according to The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.

Critics complain that Visa does not fight fair, and that it used its market power to force merchants to accept higher costs for debit cards. Merchants say they cannot refuse Visa cards because it would result in lower sales.

“A dollar is no longer a dollar in this country,” said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade association. “It’s a Visa dollar. It’s only worth 99 cents because they take a piece of every one.”

Visa officials say its critics are griping about debit products that have transformed the nation’s payment system, adding convenience for consumers and higher sales for merchants, while cutting the hassle and expense of dealing with cash and checks. In recent years, New York cabbies and McDonald’s restaurants are among those reporting higher sales as a result of accepting plastic.

“At times we have a perspective problem,” said William M. Sheedy, Visa’s president for the Americas. “Debit has become so mainstream, some of the people who have benefited have lost sight of what their business model was, what their cost structure was.”

Visa officials said the costs of debit for merchants had not gone down because the cards now provided greater value than they did five or 10 years ago. The costs must not be too onerous, they say, because merchant acceptance has doubled in the last decade.

The fees are “not a cost-based calculation, but a value-based calculation,” said Elizabeth Buse, Visa’s global head of product.

As for Visa’s market share, company officials maintain that it is rather small when considered within the larger context of all payments, where, for now at least, cash remains king.

While Visa may be among the best-known brands in the world, how it operates is a mystery to many consumers.

Visa does not distribute credit or debit cards, nor does it provide credit so consumers can buy flat-screen televisions or a Starbucks latte. Those tasks are left to the banks, which owned Visa until it went public in 2008.
100 2010-01-05 The campaign made its debut on Monday — the first Monday of the year, when resolutions to slim down are common — and was hard to miss. In what Ms. Pollock called a “morning shows road block,” six 15-second spots blanketed ABC’s “Good Morning America,” NBC’s “Today” and CBS’s “The Early Show.”

Jose Alberto Duenas, vice president for cereal marketing in the United States at Kellogg, said showing no Special K products or even a logo in ads was unprecedented for the brand.

“We’re trying to be faithful to giving real women a place to declare victory without the piece feeling overwhelmed by what the brand brings to the table,” Mr. Duenas said. “If you want to make a connection, you have to give consumers a chance to take part of the spotlight. Authenticity is what we’re looking for.”

While most Kellogg brands are consumed about equally by men and women, Special K tilts to women, who represent about 65 percent of its consumers and, as primary shoppers in households, even more of its purchasers, Mr. Duenas said.

“At the beginning it was more of a brand that targeted men and women,” he said. “But for the last eight or 10 years, we’ve focused primarily on helping women with weight loss. It’s a very in-the-know brand for women.”

Such understanding, he said, is why even though this is a weight-loss campaign making its debut in January, it avoids the R word.

“Over the last few years, ‘resolution’ is not a word that women have had a lot of affinity for,” Mr. Duenas said. “ ‘Starting a healthy lifestyle’ is a better way of describing what women want to do at the beginning of the year.”

A new Web site for the brand, thevictoryproject.msn.com, emphasizes losing weight and overall self-confidence. It features videos of women on a quest to lose weight being coached not just by a dietitian, but by fashion, hair and makeup experts as well.

Special K spent $80 million on advertising in 2008 and $73 million in the first three quarters of 2009, according to TNS Media Intelligence.

The challenge for cereal makers is, paradoxically, its popularity: with nearly 100 percent of households already eating cereal, there are few nonusers to initiate. The industry is also so dominated by two manufacturers, Kellogg and General Mills, that when a company does a big advertising push, it risks cannibalizing sales from its other brands.

Getting consumers to eat more cereal, meanwhile, is hindered by the fact that it is rarely eaten outside of the home or for meals besides breakfast. (To spur more of what marketers call “usage occasions,” cereal boxes often feature recipes like Rice Krispies Treats, Chex Mix and cornflake-coated chicken.)

By marketing a weight-loss plan that called for eating cereal twice a day, Special K’s “strategy was to double the usage occasions for breakfast cereal,” said Krista Faron, a senior analyst at Mintel, a market research firm. By introducing the Special K Challenge, and aiming at women specifically, the brand harnessed a strategy to sell more cereal and expand into other categories, Ms. Faron said.

“What I like about Special K is how they’ve really been able to leverage a cereal brand into a diet brand and to do it in a way that is sort of a soft sell that is really appealing to women,” Ms. Faron said.

“Special K is still based on a cereal, but is bigger than cereal,” said Mr. Duenas of Kellogg. “Our mission is to be a weight-loss partner, to go along with women for their whole day and whole week and give them solutions.”

A decade ago, Special K “really was a dying brand,” said Lloyd Moritz, who publishes a blog about cereal, breakfastbowl.blogspot.com. “It was losing a lot of luster and really needed to be rejuvenated. But they’ve done a great job of carving out a niche market targeting women and found a way to give Special K some meaning.”
101 2010-01-05 But many of Mr. Léger’s townsfolk fiercely disagree, arguing that the town has overstated the cost of the restoration work.

“We reject their cost estimates,” said Alain Durand, 50, a mason and metalworker who is treasurer of a movement to preserve the church. “It’s very political; if they tear down and rebuild, it’s only to fight unemployment.”

The struggle is not unique to Gesté. Across France, villages are being forced to ask hard questions about their churches, many of them deteriorating, as the number of parishioners and priests dwindles and the cost of upkeep mounts.

Béatrice de Andia, the founder and president of the Religious Heritage Observatory, in Paris, estimates that there are about 90,000 church buildings in France, of which about 17,000 are under government protection for their historic or architectural value, giving France the greatest density of religious buildings of any European country. About 10 percent of the protected churches are in perilous condition, she says, because of a lack of government financing for their preservation, as are a far larger percentage of the remaining churches.

“The Church may be eternal, but not the churches,” said Ms. de Andia, a retired government cultural official who founded the observatory in 2006 to raise awareness of the parlous state of the country’s religious heritage. “In the past, these buildings were sacred, but today there is no sense of the sacred.”

In St. Georges des Gardes, not far from here, the 19th-century church of St. Joseph was torn down in 2006; earlier, in nearby Le Fief-Sauvin, the church was razed and replaced.

Occasionally, townspeople opposing demolition have prevailed: in Arc sur Tille, near Dijon in the east of France, the 19th-century parish church remains standing after bitter protests.

The struggle over the future of village churches coincides with a national debate on the issue of French identity, which is taking place against the backdrop of large numbers of Muslim immigrants. And it is complicated by a 1907 measure — when anticlerical government leaders were trying to rein in the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church in France — that made all the country’s churches and cathedrals the property of local governments.

In other countries, notably England and Italy, disused houses of worship have been converted into homes, stores or museums. In France, there is an emotional resistance to the practice, though in Dijon, an abandoned church now serves as a theater, and in Alsace, also in the east, former synagogues now serve as museums.

Gesté’s neo-Gothic church was completed in 1870 on the ruins of a 16th-century church that was destroyed in the French Revolution. Deeply Catholic Anjou, where Gesté lies, resisted the revolution, and its church buildings suffered when the resistance was suppressed.

As French identity becomes increasingly secular, some see the crumbling of village churches as a symbol of crumbling faith.

The Rev. Pierre Pouplard, 69, pastor of Gesté’s parish church, disagrees. “I see no connection,” he said. “People cling to their church here. Church attendance here is very strong.”

Yet Father Pouplard spoke in the rectory of a neighboring town, which is also part of his parish. For the last 12 years he has been responsible for four village churches, in addition to Gesté, because of a dwindling number of priests. France counts only 9,000 priests today, compared with 40,000 in 1940. He supports the destruction of the church in Gesté and its replacement.

“There is the emotional attachment; all the people of Gesté are attached to their church,” he said. “A majority would have preferred to keep it.” But he accepts the mayor’s budgetary arithmetic, and points to the example of Fief-Sauvin, where 15 years ago a modern church replaced a crumbling 19th-century building.

The debate over the future of the church has split the town into two camps. Had Father Pouplard supported the restoration of the church, Mr. Durand says, a majority would have followed him. “It’s a question of taste,” he said. But in the last local elections, in 2008, when the future of the church was the main issue, a slight majority supported Mr. Léger and his majority on the town council.

Mr. Durand shows a visitor the plans of a contemporary church built nearby with a circular ground plan that he says will resemble Gesté’s new church.

“It’s for entertainment, it’s a music hall,” he said dismissively. “You could put a sign on it saying, ‘Groceries.’ ”
102 2010-01-05 The screener had his look under the wings and lowered his wand. Merriment ensued all around — but it had to look pretty silly.

And off we went to our flight to Arizona, which proceeded smoothly with the smaller parrot asleep in her cage under a seat.

The final week of 2009, after the underwear bomber set fire to himself on that Delta-Northwest flight approaching Detroit from Amsterdam, was one of the strangest periods yet in the annals of air travel security since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Business travelers and other frequent fliers, who had long adapted stoically to whatever new security hurdles were thrown in their paths, were no longer reacting with equanimity.

In many cases, stoicism was replaced by ridicule over what some travelers saw as knee-jerk reactions to the underwear bomber.

I heard from a bunch of business travelers. But my favorite e-mail message offered some tongue-in-cheek security advice.

Mads Oyen, a policy specialist at Unicef in New York, suggested removing from a plane any specific seat that had been used by a would-be terrorist. “If he used, say, 36E, remove that seat. Then this cannot be tried again,” Mr. Oyen wrote.

Another suggestion from Mr. Oyen addressed the widely criticized Transportation Security Administration rule, imposed right after the Christmas episode and quickly withdrawn, that passengers on flights to the United States not be informed of where they were, by cockpit announcements or by those video-screen maps that show a plane’s position.

“Not only remove the in-flight maps, but tell people after seating that they are headed to a destination they are not booked for,” he wrote. “It is important that security measures are unpredictable.”

In a phone interview, Mr. Oyen recalled that he once watched security screeners at an airport in Uganda put a uniformed soldier’s loaded gun through the X-ray scanner “presumably to check for sharp objects.”

On a more serious note, an airline pilot who did not want his name used, asked, “When will passengers say enough is enough with the ineffective theatrical security measures?”

That remains to be seen. As has already been reported, the T.S.A. again revised procedures on Sunday, requiring pat-downs and extra screening for United States-bound passengers who are citizens of 14 countries identified as being either state sponsors of terrorism or friendly toward certain terrorists groups. At the same time, the T.S.A. relaxed the most strict security measures for United States citizens and most others not flying through, or citizens of, those 14 nations.

Meanwhile, I should note that my wife and I and Rosie the parrot arrived on time in Phoenix, where we then picked up Petey, the other parrot, at a special trailer set aside by Continental for passengers to fetch pets.

When he heard my wife’s voice, he let out a screech from his well-padded cage that could have been heard in Las Vegas.

He had obviously had a good flight, too. And if he had any complaints about security, we didn’t hear about them. Petey wasn’t talking.
103 2010-01-05 Stop the presses. That’s what Robert Warner, 53, does every time he takes his foot off the treadle at one of the antique letterpresses at Bowne and Company Stationers at the South Street Seaport Museum. Bowne, founded in 1775 and claiming to be the oldest company in the city still operating under the same name, opened the museum print shop to celebrate its bicentennial. Twenty years later, Mr. Warner, an eyeglasses-maker and artist, wandered in to volunteer. Now he is the master printer there in a former cast iron stove factory from 1835, turning out stationery, social announcements and commemorative items to raise money for the museum and teaching the digital generation of schoolchildren an ancient craft.

The scary part of hand-set printing: See, there’s no safety on this. If you reach for the paper as it’s printing, you could lose your fingers.

What he aims for: You want the type to kiss the page, not bite the page. Smooth. It shouldn’t feel like matzo, or a waffle. Otherwise you’re wearing down the face of the type, and these you can’t get any more.

His favorite type: I like Engraver’s Roman very much. Bodoni — that’s a heart-breaker.

How he helped Andy Warhol to see: I grew up in Geneva, N.Y. No college, I went right to work for an optical company. Later, I designed eyeglasses and window displays for Morgenthal Frederics. I developed the Oberlin, based on old yearbook pictures from Oberlin. I fitted glasses for both Jackie Onassis and Andy Warhol. One day Dr. Ruth, one day Tom Wolfe. If I had my pliers, I would adjust your nose pads so your glasses don’t slip like that.

Going from eyeglasses to printing (without hitting Control + P): A friend sent me here to buy recipe cards. There were two women printing. Barbara Henry, the curator, and a Japanese woman. They weren’t talking to each other. No one was minding the front of the store. I asked, “May I volunteer to help?” They said, “We can’t teach you to print.” I said, “I’ll come in as shopkeeper.” When the other woman quit, Barbara said, “How do I find a printer?” I raised my hand. “If you teach me, I’ll print.” I caught on pretty quickly. I fixed the gauge pin that holds the paper. She said, “Now you are a printer.”

Biggest influence: Ray Johnson, the father of mail art. You send a collage to someone, and they add to it and send it back. He jumped off a bridge in Sag Harbor. He was 67. Six and seven add up to 13.
104 2010-01-05 The Jordanian service, called the General Intelligence Directorate, for years has been one of the C.I.A.’s closest and most useful allies in the Middle East.

In a telephone interview, a person associated with the Pakistani Taliban identified the bomber as Humam Khalil Mohammed, a Jordanian physician. Western officials said that Mr. Mohammed had been in a Jordanian prison and that he was recruited by the Jordanian spy service.

The bomber was not closely searched because of his perceived value as someone who could lead American forces to senior Qaeda leaders, and because the Jordanian intelligence officer had identified him as a potentially valuable informant, the Western officials said.

The Western officials and others who were interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.

Current and former American officials said Monday that because of Mr. Mohammed’s medical background, he might have been recruited to find the whereabouts of Ayman al-Zawahri, the Egyptian doctor who is Al Qaeda’s second in command.

Agency officers had traveled from Kabul, the Afghan capital, to Khost for a meeting with the informant, a sign that the C.I.A. had come to trust the informant and that it was eager to learn what he might have gleaned from operations in the field, according to a former C.I.A. official with experience in Afghanistan.

The former official said that the fact that militants could carry out a successful attack using a double agent showed their strength even after a steady barrage of missile strikes fired by C.I.A. drone aircraft.

“Double agent operations are really complex,” he said. “The fact that they can pull this off shows that they are not really on the run. They have the ability to kick back and think about these things.”

The death of the Jordanian intelligence officer, Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, was reported in recent days by Jordanian officials, but they did not confirm exactly where he was killed or what he was doing in Afghanistan.

Jordanian intelligence officials were deeply embarrassed by the attacks because they had taken the informant to the Americans, said one American government official briefed on the events.

The official said that the Jordanians had such a good reputation with American intelligence officials that the informant was not screened before entering the compound.

Jarret Brachman, author of “Global Jihadism: Theory and Practice” and a consultant to the United States government about terrorism, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Mohammed had used the online persona Abu Dujana al-Khorasani and was an influential jihadi voice on the Web.

“He’s one of the most revered authors on the jihadists’ forums,” Mr. Brachman said.

“He’s in the top five jihadists. He’s one of the biggest guns out there.”

In many of the posts under his online persona, Mr. Mohammed used elusive language filled with references to literature and the Koran to describe his support for violent opposition to the United States-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“When a fighter for God kills a U.S. soldier on the corner of a tank, the supporters of Jihad have killed tens of thousands of Americans through their connection” to the opposition, he wrote in one posting.

Mr. Brachman said that Al Fajr Media, which is Al Qaeda’s official media distribution network, conducted an interview with Abu Dujana al-Khorasani published in Al Qaeda’s online magazine, called Vanguards of Khorasan.

The name of the bomber was first reported by Al Jazeera, which identified him as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi. The television network reported that Mr. Balawi was taken to Afghanistan to help track down Mr. Zawahri.

The attack was also embarrassing for Jordan’s government, which did not want the depths of its cooperation with the C.I.A. revealed to its own citizens or other Arabs in the region.

A statement by the official Jordanian news agency said Captain Zeid was killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday “as he performed his humanitarian duty with the Jordanian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping forces.”

The United States, and the C.I.A. in particular, are deeply unpopular in Jordan, where at least half the population is of Palestinian origin and where Washington’s support for Israel is roundly condemned.

King Abdullah II and his government, while working closely with Washington in counterterrorism operations and providing strategic support for operations in Iraq, try to keep that work secret.

The Pakistani Taliban had previously said the bomber was someone the C.I.A. had recruited to work with them, who then offered the militants his services as a double agent.

The General Intelligence Directorate has received millions of dollars from the C.I.A. since the American invasion of Iraq, where the Jordanian spy agency played a central role in the campaign against Iraqi insurgents.

In the past, Jordanian officials have privately criticized American intelligence services, saying they relied too heavily on technology and not enough on agents capable of infiltrating operations. In 2006, the Jordanians were credited with helping to locate and kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.

The C.I.A. declined to comment about the circumstances of the bombing in Afghanistan.

Current and former American intelligence officials said the C.I.A. base in Khost was used to collect intelligence about militant networks in the border region.

The C.I.A. officers on the base used the information to plan strikes against Qaeda and Taliban leaders, along with top operatives of the Haqqani network.

United States officials have been applying pressure to the government of Pakistan to drive out the Haqqani network, whose fighters hold sway over parts of Afghanistan, including Paktika, Paktia and Khost Provinces, and are a serious threat to American forces.

A second former C.I.A. official said that Mr. Zeid’s presence on the Khost base was a sign that the Jordanian intelligence agency was using a spy to infiltrate militant networks in the region, and most likely to penetrate cells of Arab Qaeda militants.

“If the Jordanian intelligence officer had been vouching for this guy, the C.I.A. would definitely have wanted him on the base,” said the former officer.

The remains of the seven C.I.A. officers killed in the attack arrived in a military plane on Monday at Dover Air Force Base, where a private ceremony was held. The event was attended by Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, as well as by family members of the slain officers.
105 2010-01-05 Common abdominal surgery like removal of the uterus or the gallbladder may pose a greater risk to older patients than generally reported. A new study finds that 5 percent of those 65 and older died within 90 days of surgery and that 17 percent developed complications.

The risks increased with advancing age: 2.5 percent of patients in their late 60s died after surgery, compared with 6 percent of those in their late 70s, 12.6 percent in their late 80s and 16.7 percent in their early 90s.

The rate of postsurgical complications also increased with age, to 22 percent for patients in their late 80s and early 90s, from 14.6 percent for those in their late 60s.

The study, published in the December issue of Archives of Surgery, examined outcomes of fairly common procedures performed on 101,318 adults 65 and older at all nonmilitary hospitals in Washington State from 1987 through 2004. The study’s lead author, Dr. Nader N. Massarweh, who is doing his surgical training at the University of Washington in Seattle, said more accurate information on the risks of surgery would help patients and their families make better decisions about elective and nonelective procedures, and would prod doctors and hospitals to improve care for older people.
106 2010-01-05 BEIJING — Liu Xiaobo, the Beijing writer who was given an 11-year prison sentence on subversion charges on Dec. 25 after urging Chinese leaders to embrace democratic reforms, has appealed his conviction to the Beijing Supreme People’s Court, one of his lawyers said Tuesday.

The lawyer, Shang Baojun, said Mr. Liu told him during a meeting that he had filed the lengthy appeal on Dec. 29. The court has 45 days under Chinese law to consider the appeal.

“We are making an effort to defend his innocence, but we have no idea whether it will be successful,” Mr. Shang said.

Mr. Liu’s sentence, judged by many analysts to be unusually harsh, has drawn criticism from human rights groups, Western governments and writers worldwide. Most regard the chances that it will be overturned or softened as slim.

Among other points, Mr. Shang said, the appeal requests that Mr. Liu’s sentence be reduced by the amount of time — more than six months — that he was confined in an undisclosed location before being formally arrested last June 23. The court earlier refused to count that time against his sentence.

Mr. Liu, 53, was seized by security officials in December 2008 as he and other intellectuals prepared to issue Charter 08, a lengthy manifesto that called on China’s Communist Party to uphold individual rights and relinquish its monopoly on power. After being held more than a year in secret detention and later in jail, Mr. Liu was found guilty by a Beijing court on Dec. 25 of “inciting subversion of state power.”

130 2010-01-06 The military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, where United States war casualties are brought home from overseas, will open a new center on Wednesday for families who travel there to witness the return of their loved ones’ remains. The center will be staffed by counselors and other specialists. With the lifting of an 18-year ban on news coverage of returning United States war dead in April 2009, more families are traveling to Dover. About 56 percent of families have consented to external media coverage since the ban was lifted.
131 2010-01-06 A federal appeals court panel on Tuesday strongly backed the powers of the government to hold Guantánamo detainees and other noncitizens suspected of committing terrorist acts.

In a sweeping opinion, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the presidential war power to detain those suspected of terrorism is not limited even by international law of war.

The decision, if it is not reversed by the Supreme Court, could apply to all cases involving detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, since all of those cases are heard by the District of Columbia Circuit. As a result, the Obama administration will have a stronger position when opposing a court order to release a terrorism suspect.

In its ruling, the court denied a request by Ghaleb Nassar al-Bihani, a former cook for a Taliban paramilitary brigade, to be released from the detention center at Guantánamo. It is the first case to directly apply a landmark 2008 Supreme Court decision that allowed prisoners to challenge their detention.

Mr. Bihani, who is from Yemen, was captured in 2002 when his brigade surrendered. He challenged his detention with a petition for habeas corpus, which the courts did not act on before the decision of the 2008 Supreme Court case, Boumediene v. Bush, which said federal judges had jurisdiction to hear such claims.
132 2010-01-06 Asian investments in Silicon Valley present some risks for America’s top technology companies, which could lose their connection to top innovations.

Asian manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta, as a result, could wrestle away the edge in research and design.

“The manufacturers have gotten more competitive as it relates to innovation, and in some instances they’re already competing directly with their customers,” said Patrick Moorhead, a vice president at Advance Micro Devices, a major PC chip maker.

The investments by Asian companies have already started to pay off. At the Consumer Electronics Show this week in Las Vegas, people will see laptops that end sluggish start times and instead boot up instantly and TVs that do not require remotes because they can see the gestures of viewers. These features are a result of strategic investments in technology by Asian manufacturers. One Asian manufacturer turned investor is Quanta, based in Taiwan, which has long been one of the largest manufacturers of laptops and personal computers for major brands like H.P., Acer and Dell.

To keep those customers coming back, it needs unique product designs and technologies that give it an edge over competitors. Last October, Quanta invested $10 million into Tilera, a chip start-up based in San Jose, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley, that has designed a radical computer processor. Tilera is gambling that it can take business from the major chip makers like Intel and A.M.D.

Quanta also joined a group investing $16 million in Canesta, another chip maker based in Silicon Valley. When combined with a digital camera, Canesta’s products let computers, televisions and other devices view objects in three dimensions. That means that a person could move photos or documents around a PC’s desktop or change TV channels simply by waving a hand.

Elton Yang, a vice president at Quanta, said there was a high likelihood that the technology could make its way into laptops in 2010. Eventually all makers of personal computers will have a chance to buy Canesta’s technology, but Quanta’s investment gives it a temporary design lead.

“The PC companies are looking for a new future, and we want to attract them to our machines,” Mr. Yang said. Over the last 10 years, Canesta has made its pitch to more than 100 venture capitalists in Silicon Valley — only to be rejected time and again. James Spare, the chief executive of Canesta, praised the willingness of companies like Quanta to back risky start-ups needing many years to turn ideas into products.

“It’s no secret that these companies make most of the devices we use in our daily lives,” Mr. Spare said. “And they’re only becoming more and more influential when it comes to innovation and guiding technology choices.”

Foxconn, one of the largest electronics makers, has found technology investments, too. It has backed Innovation Works, an investment and incubation company started last year by the former president of Google’s Chinese operations, Kai-fu Lee.

With $115 million at its disposal, Innovation Works, based in Beijing, has pledged to “build dream teams to collect, analyze, prioritize and execute on the most promising ideas” in the Internet and mobile computing markets.

Ambitious Taiwanese manufacturers are now talking to influential component makers like Intel and A.M.D. to help shape what tomorrow’s chips and hard drives will do.

“They do have a much bigger voice in what companies are doing on the chip level than before,” said Mr. Moorhead. “We are interfacing more with them than we ever have.”

Some former manufacturers have already made the transition and are gaining global brand recognition. Acer and Asustek are Taiwan’s most prominent computer brands, but both companies were contract fabricators for major American companies. Some of their executives steeped in this manufacturing tradition now run the investment arms of the companies.

For example, the Silicon Valley start-up DeviceVM has developed software that lets computers boot up in about five seconds, rather than the minutes many computers can take to start. Both Asustek and Acer, through its investment arm called iD Innovation, have put money into DeviceVM, and the company’s software now appears on computers from a variety of makers including the world’s largest PC company, H.P.

The Asian companies often back projects that Silicon Valley’s financial heavyweights pass on because pay offs are too low and take too long. The Asian companies are “thinking that they didn’t get their fair share of the technology pie in the past,” Mr. Chao said. “Now they have money and will take the risks needed to build up new levels of expertise.”

For entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, the money flowing from Taiwan and China represents a blessing.

“It’s great,” said Mr. Spare of Canesta, “to have another pool of money to go after.”
133 2010-01-06 In the bitter cold on Monday night, a man and woman picked apart a pyramid of clear trash bags, the discards of the HM clothing store that reigns in blazing plate-glass glory on 34th Street, just east of Sixth Avenue in Manhattan.

At the back entrance on 35th Street, awaiting trash haulers, were bags of garments that appear to have never been worn. And to make sure that they never would be worn or sold, someone had slashed most of them with box cutters or razors, a familiar sight outside H & M’s back door. The man and woman were there to salvage what had not been destroyed.

He worked quickly, never uttering a word. A bag was opened and eyed, and if it held something of promise, was tossed at the feet of the woman. She said her name was Pepa.

Were the clothes usually cut up before they were thrown out?

“A veces,” she said in Spanish. Sometimes.

She packed up a few items that had escaped the blade  a bright green T-shirt that said “Summer of Surf,” and a dark-blue hoodie in size 12, with a Divided label. The rest was returned to the pyramid.

It is winter. A third of the city is poor. And unworn clothing is being destroyed nightly.

A few doors down on 35th Street, hundreds of garments tagged for sale in Wal-Mart  hoodies and T-shirts and pants  were discovered in trash bags the week before Christmas, apparently dumped by a contractor for Wal-Mart that has space on the block.

Each piece of clothing had holes punched through it by a machine.

They were found by Cynthia Magnus, who attends classes at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York on Fifth Avenue and noticed the piles of discarded clothing as she walked to the subway station in Herald Square. She was aghast at the waste, and dragged some of the bags home to Brooklyn, hoping that someone would be willing to take on the job of patching the clothes and making them wearable.

A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Melissa Hill, said the company normally donates all its unworn goods to charities, and would have to investigate why the items found on 35th Street were discarded.

During her walks down 35th Street, Ms. Magnus said, it is more common to find destroyed clothing in the H & M trash. On Dec. 7, during an early cold snap, she said, she saw about 20 bags filled with H & M clothing that had been cut up.

“Gloves with the fingers cut off,” Ms. Magnus said, reciting the inventory of ruined items. “Warm socks. Cute patent leather Mary Jane school shoes, maybe for fourth graders, with the instep cut up with a scissor. Men’s jackets, slashed across the body and the arms. The puffy fiber fill was coming out in big white cotton balls.” The jackets were tagged $59, $79 and $129.

This week, a manager in the H & M store on 34th Street said inquiries about its disposal practices had to be made to its United States headquarters. However, various officials did not respond to 10 inquiries made Tuesday by phone and e-mail.

Directly around the corner from H & M is a big collection point for New York Cares, which conducts an annual coat drive.

“We’d be glad to take unworn coats, and companies often send them to us,” said Colleen Farrell, a spokeswoman for New York Cares.

More than coats were tossed out. “The H & M thing was just ridiculous, not only clothing, but bags and bags of sturdy plastic hangers,” Ms. Magnus said. “I took a dozen of them. A girl can never have enough hangers.”

H & M, which is based in Sweden, has an executive in charge of corporate responsibility who leads the company’s sustainability efforts. On its Web site, H&M reports that to save paper, it has shrunk its shipping labels.

“How about all the solid waste generated by throwing away usable garments and plastic hangers?” Ms. Magnus asked in a letter to the executive, Ingrid Schullstrom. She volunteered to help H & M connect with a charity or agency in New York that could put the unsold items to better use than simply tossing them in the trash. So far, she said, she has gotten no response.

On Monday night, Pepa’s shopping bag held a few items. She pointed to her gray sweatpants. “From here,” she said.
134 2010-01-06 This lack of self-criticism is feeding Congressional hostility toward the Fed. Mr. Bernanke is still likely to win confirmation for a second term, based on his aggressive and creative policies once the crisis began. But Congress hasn’t decided whether to expand his regulatory authority and is considering reining in the Fed’s other main mission — setting interest rates.

A once-marginal proposal — from Representative , the Republican — that would give Congress the power to review interest rate decisions recently passed the House and will soon be considered by the Senate.

Economists are generally horrified by this idea. If Congress could force Fed officials to answer questions about every interest rate move, the process could easily become politicized. A politicized central bank is a first step toward runaway inflation.

But politicizing monetary policy isn’t the only mistake Congress could make. It also could end up going in the other direction and handing Fed officials more power without asking them to grapple with their failures.

When Mr. Bernanke is challenged about the Fed’s performance, he often points out that recognizing a bubble is hard. “It is extraordinarily difficult,” he said during his Senate confirmation hearing last month, “to know in real time if an asset price is appropriate or not.”

Most of the time, that’s true. Do you know if will keep going up? Is gold now in the midst of a bubble? What will happen to your house’s value? Questions like these are usually an invitation to hubris.

But the recent housing bubble was an exception. By any serious measure, houses in much of this country had become overvalued. From the late 1960s to 2000, the ratio of the median national house price to median income hovered from 2.9 to 3.2. By 2005, it had shot up to 4.5. In some places, buyers were spending twice as much on their monthly payment as they would have spent renting a similar house, without even considering the down payment.

More than a few people — economists, journalists, even some Fed officials — noticed this phenomenon. It wasn’t that hard, if you were willing to look at economic fundamentals. You couldn’t know exactly when or how far prices would fall, but it seemed clear they were out of control. Indeed, making that call was similar to what the Fed does when it sets interest rates: using concrete data to decide whether some part of the economy is too hot (or too cold).

And Fed officials could have had a real impact if they had decided to attack the bubble. Imagine if Mr. Greenspan, then considered an oracle, announced he was cracking down on wishful-thinking mortgages, as he had the authority to do.

So why did Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke get it wrong?

The answer seems to be more psychological than economic. They got trapped in an echo chamber of conventional wisdom. Real estate agents, home builders, Wall Street executives, many economists and millions of homeowners were all saying that home prices would not drop, and the typically sober-minded officials at the Fed persuaded themselves that it was true. “We’ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis,” Mr. Bernanke said on CNBC in 2005.

He and his colleagues fell victim to the same weakness that bedeviled the engineers of the Challenger , the planners of the and Wars, and the airline pilots who have made tragic cockpit errors. They didn’t adequately question their own assumptions. It’s an entirely human mistake.

Which is why it is likely to happen again.

What’s missing from the debate over financial re-regulation is a serious discussion of how to reduce the odds that the Fed — however much authority it has — will listen to the echo chamber when the next bubble comes along. A simple first step would be for Mr. Bernanke to discuss the Fed’s recent failures, in detail. If he doesn’t volunteer such an accounting, Congress could request one.

In the future, a review process like this could become a standard response to a financial crisis. Andrew Lo, an economist, has proposed a financial version of the — an independent body to issue a fact-finding report after a crash or a bust. If such a board had existed after the crisis, notes Paul Romer, the Stanford economist and expert on economic growth, it might have done some good.

Whether we like it or not, the Fed really does seem to be the best agency to regulate financial firms. (It now has authority over only some firms.) As the lender of last resort, it already has a vested interest in the health of those firms. The Fed’s prestige also tends to give it its pick of people who want to work on economic policy.

“The Federal Reserve has unparalleled expertise,” Mr. Bernanke told Congress last month. “We have a great group of economists, financial market experts and others who are unique in Washington in their ability to address these issues.”

Fair enough. At some point, though, it sure would be nice to hear those experts explain how they missed the biggest bubble of our time.
135 2010-01-06 The service is appealing, comic-opera stuff. And the food, while basic, is often quite good. The spirit of Sant Ambroeus, a restaurant born in Milan in 1936 and mother to the society rooms in the Village, on the Upper East Side and Main Street in Southampton, has never been more serene.

Vitello tonnato, the classic summery antipasto of chilled sliced veal served alongside what amounts to a deep cloud of tuna-infused mayonnaise, with a few fried capers strewn about for salty crunch, is here offered as advertised, no more. That is right for the room and its aesthetic: silky tuna sauce and thin folds of veal, just as the grandmothers made, unchanged by time or fashion.

A carpaccio of beef with a small tangle of wild mushrooms and delicate Parmesan chips is likewise flavorful, likewise welcome, as are thinly sliced artichokes with soft baby arugula swaddled in bracing lemon, with more of those cheese chips. Micro-greens, those biosphere wonders too easily overcome by dressing, here stand up to little croutons and welcome a soft-poached egg, if not crisped prosciutto in the role of bacon or pancetta.

Is an appetizer of seared scallops with white asparagus and black truffle a good use of $18? That’s a question to wrestle, and there’s no correct answer. It’s the culinary equivalent of wondering whether Ferragamo shoes are worth the scratch. If they are to you, they are. The scallops are certainly well cooked.

In another direction there are the now-requisite raw-bar offerings of crudi. Of these, there is a shockingly flavorful mackerel plate, with lemon confit, slightly pickled red onion and smoked salt, the combination of which so heightens the flavor of the fish as to amaze. A simple dish of yellowtail tuna, pomegranate seeds and lime might be better consumed on a boat somewhere, with the fish still half butchered on the stern, but even still: it’s not unfresh. And there is a delicious and deeply attractive plate of king crab, sea urchin, pickled jalapeño and avocado. As young Mr. Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf discovered in San Remo, it can be tough to share.

Pastas are generally simple, with a few change-ups thrown into the mix, probably for market flair. These, along with a muddy stuffed chicken, are the missteps on the menu. Amatriciana, for instance, is another classic of Italian cuisine, a sauce traditionally made of guanciale, or jowl bacon, with pecorino and tomato. Here it’s rendered with tuna, and served with a fat sort of rigatoni from Gragnano. It’s interesting, not great. Paccheri served with a red snapper ragout, cherry tomatoes and baby artichokes is less interesting, and not good.

But ravioli with sausage and burrata, draped in a fennel purée, is wonderful: creamy with a slight bite. There is a fine saffron risotto most notable for the pile of pulled veal that sits atop it, rich and salty, thick with fat. And spaghetti with little Manila clams and fresh tomatoes is a classic of the form.

A sensible person might make a meal out of the above and avoid the high prices of Casa Lever’s meat and fish courses. These are meant to sate those who don’t look at menu prices. But there are splurges worth the price: veal Milanese, for instance, pounded wide and fried with a rare excellence. Also terrific lamb chops with polenta and dark, rustic mushrooms strewn alongside them.

The restaurant’s bone-in New York strip is roughly the size of a hardcover Italian-English dictionary. It’s cooked crusty and rich, as if for an audition at Peter Luger. It’s excellent. So too is the Dover sole, with a Dijon sauce, vacationing from France and perfect alongside a glass of fragrant Ciallabianco, from Ronchi di Cialla in Friuli.

Desserts are worthy of Sant Ambroeus: marvelous sorbetti and towering gianduja of hazelnut and chocolate; truffles of chocolate sorbet, with orange gelée; even just a serving of cut fruit, designed for ladies who continue to lunch.

None of the food at Casa Lever is particularly groundbreaking. It owes little to the recent trend toward Italian cooking of the sort found at Marea or Del Posto, all towering ambition and crazy imagination. That’s all right. People used to say the thing about Italian cuisine was that it is mostly just excellent ingredients served plain on a plate, without much interpretation. Sometimes that’s worth recalling over just such a meal, in a beautiful room.

136 2010-01-06 “Both Christies need to step very carefully,” said Brigid C. Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University. “With the political climate, the public concerns about the financial services industry, and Chris’s reputation as someone who fights corruption, if there’s even the insinuation that Todd was receiving information from inside government that benefited his business, it would be very damaging to the new governor.”

Even at first glance, it is easy to recognize that the two men are brothers. (The governor-elect is 47, his brother 45.) There is an obvious physical resemblance: big smiles, bright eyes and hulking frames. Both radiate a gregarious, quick-witted intensity. Whether appearing together or speaking about each other separately, it is also easy to see a deep affection shared by two men who socialize together, with their wives, several times a month and who still refer to each other as best friends.

Growing up in Newark and Livingston, Chris Christie was the straight-A student and, as the oldest of three children (his sister, Dawn, is seven years younger than Todd), the responsible one in the family. Whenever the neighborhood children played cowboys and Indians, Todd Christie recalls, Chris wanted to be the sheriff.

Todd Christie was more interested in being class clown than class president (although he managed to become both), and remembers relying on his brother to help him out of countless self-inflicted problems. Both were successful in school and on the baseball diamond, and were viewed by friends and classmates as an unusually tight pair.

“The amazing thing about them was that they had all these similar interests, but no sibling rivalry,” said Harlan Coben, a novelist who grew up near them. “In most families, brothers and sister to some degree end up competing for recognition, or parents’ attention. But those two always seemed to be pulling for each other.”

During Christopher Christie’s three-year stint as president of his class at Livingston High School from 1978-80, his brother eagerly helped hang campaign posters and distribute leaflets. At the University of Delaware, where the older Christie was elected student council president, Todd Christie barnstormed the campus, recruiting volunteers and discreetly moving his hands to his neck to warn his brother when the speeches were dragging on too long.

“Chris is an incredible politician,” he said. “But every politician talks too much.”

When Christopher Christie went on to Seton Hall Law School, Todd Christie followed their father’s path to the financial world, where his high energy and salesman’s bravado allowed him to flourish quickly at the Wall Street trade specialist firm Spear, Leeds & Kellogg. He rose to become chief executive, and when Goldman Sachs bought the company in 2000 for more than $6 billion, Todd Christie’s piece of the deal amounted to about $60 million.

By 2003, however, Spear, Leeds was under investigation on suspicion of cheating customers to benefit the firm. Todd Christie resigned in March 2003, although he says that his departure was not related to the inquiry and that he did not find out until months later that he was among the traders being investigated. When the United States attorney in Manhattan, David N. Kelley, secured criminal indictments against 15 traders at the firm in 2005, Todd Christie was spared, and faced only civil fraud charges along with four other traders.

The company ultimately settled the case, repaying more than $16 million to investors, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. During the campaign, Christopher Christie stated that his brother had done “absolutely nothing wrong,” and in an interview this week Todd Christie said he had been “completely exonerated.” Two of the indicted traders pleaded guilty; the 13 others were ultimately cleared of criminal charges.

The Securities and Exchange Administration settlement Todd Christie signed, dated Oct. 15, 2008, maintains that he carried out hundreds of trades that brought the firm thousands of dollars in profits at its customers’ expense, and had violated stock exchange rules.

While the investigation produced uncomfortable headlines, particularly when Christopher Christie was deliberating whether to run for governor in 2005, the windfall his brother earned on Wall Street certainly helped ingratiate him with party leaders.

Todd Christie began giving tens of thousands of dollars to New Jersey’s Republican county chairmen in 2001, at a time when they were deciding whom to recommend that the Bush administration nominate as the state’s United States attorney. Three months after his brother was sworn in at that job, Todd Christie wrote a $225,000 check to the Republican National Committee.

Democrats have characterized those contributions as a blunt attempt to help his brother become United States attorney, but Todd Christie insists there was no connection between the two.

“I’d always been involved in politics, but since I’d had the good fortune to become successful, I had more to give,” he said.

The most delicate — and controversial — part of his political efforts came during the six years his brother was the state’s top federal prosecutor. Christopher Christie was barred from participating in political activity. But Todd Christie, fair or not, was seen by many Republicans as a kind of family political proxy.

He attended presidential conventions and local political gatherings, at one point setting up a vending cart to offer “Christie’s popcorn” to conventioneers. He went on to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to party leaders in New Jersey and across the country who ultimately rallied behind his brother’s bid for governor this year.

“Todd always had an interest in the issues, so it wasn’t that surprising to see him at conventions or events,” said Tom Wilson, former State Republican chairman. “But did some people go to him because they thought, ‘Oh, he’s the guy doing Chris’s politics now’? Sure.”

Todd was certainly deeply involved in his brother’s successful race last year against Jon S. Corzine. He served as his brother’s adviser, helped organize support and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. He donated $200,000 to the Republican Governors’ Association, which ran ads attacking Christopher Christie’s opponents, during both the Republican primary and the general election.

Despite Todd Christie’s attempts to keep much of his work low-profile, he could not resist engaging in a highly publicized Facebook dispute with a political consultant for one of Christopher Christie’s rivals in the Republican primary, writing at one point that he “can’t wait to dance on your political grave.”

In the general election, Democrats also tried to make an issue of Todd’s legal troubles with federal regulators and Chrisopher Christie’s decision in 2007 to give a no-bid legal contract, to monitor an orthopedics firm, to David N. Kelley, the former federal prosecutor who had handled the case against Todd Christie’s firm.

Christopher Christie says that the contract was awarded on merit, and that he and Mr. Kelley have never discussed his brother’s case. Mr. Kelley has concurred, saying his decisions in the Spear, Leeds investigation were influenced solely by the evidence.

Todd Christie did not address the issue during the campaign, but said this week that it was painful to see his travails used to attack his brother, and a relief that it did not determine the outcome of the race.

“For politicians to try to twist my situation against Chris was unfair and untrue,” he said. “And it was great that the public realized that, too.”

Now that his brother is about to assume control of state government, Todd Christie said he would be content to step back from political life. (The two men and their families spent New Year’s Eve at Christopher Christie’s home playing Pictionary and Scattergories.) He said he would limit his involvement in government affairs to ensure that he and his current investment firm, Big Blue Trading L.L.C., did not become a political issue.

“Not going to happen,” he said. “I’ve worked hard to see Chris achieve this goal, and I’m just unbelievably proud. I don’t need politics.”
137 2010-01-06 Israel’s biggest news Web site, Ynet, which belongs to the Yediot Aharonot newspaper group, has just posted five of the videos under the headline “Gaza: An inside look.” Because so little from Gaza makes it into the Israeli news media — Israeli journalists, like all Israelis, have been barred by their government from entering for more than three years — this is something of a new frontier.

“We thought it very important to show the Israeli public the other side of the conflict,” said Yael Golan, news director of Ynet, which gets one million unique hits a day. “With these videos we have a chance to show what we can’t normally show.”

The site’s first video, called “Protest Song” by Mohammed Fares, shows Ayman Maghmas of a group, Palestinian Rapperz, explaining to a Gaza audience the role of rap and hip-hop as a means of protest. Mr. Maghmas, who wears a T-shirt that says in English “Hip hop is not dead. It lives in Palestine,” lost his father and apartment in the war. He explains that just as African-Americans use rap to denounce oppression, so can Gazans express their suffering through it.

In Arabic, he and his group chant: “Hands that degrade and hurt a small child trying to free himself from the enslaver, the conqueror who came and conquered our lives, ruined the colors of our hope. When will the day come when the conscience will awaken?”

Over the words are scenes of some of the destruction from the war.

Mr. Fares, 22, who made the video, is from the Jabaliya refugee camp and is studying English. He says that he believes in nonviolence and that he sees the videos as a way of reaching out to Israel and the world.

The comments section under each video clip on Ynet is filled with not entirely welcoming responses (“Ynet, you should be ashamed! You are giving a platform to our enemies!”). But there are some like this one from Shoshana: “It is moving to see life on the other side of the barrier. They are human beings just like us.”

Awatif Aljadili, 28, a Gazan who works as a television producer, said that was exactly the kind of response she was seeking. She made her video about a field trip of a girls’ school and what it is like for a couple of the pupils who were wounded in the war. The girls sing songs about eating well and taking care of their teeth and then about how they too want to live normal lives like those of children the world over.

“For a long time, we thought that people outside Gaza hated us,” Ms. Aljadili said. “Then we realized that they just don’t know us. We needed to reach out. Peace between countries starts with good relations between individuals. We have to talk with each other. But many here are afraid of talking with Israelis. They will be accused of being spies.”

Asked if it bothered them to work with an Israeli organization for the videos, all said no. “I don’t have a problem with the source of the cameras,” said Mazen Naim, 23, one of the videographers. “We all know that B’Tselem works for human rights.”

One of the most interesting videos brings viewers inside the smuggler tunnels through which most consumer goods are brought into Gaza. Young men are asked why they work there, and they explain that there is no other source of work. They add that they always pray before going down into the tunnels because there are so many accidents and deaths inside them.

The maker of that video, Rifaat Hamdia, 30, said he wanted to show the world that the tunnels many think of as dedicated to Hamas arms smuggling are actually the source of basic goods like cooking oil and detergent.

Mr. Hamdia went into the tunnels while filming and knows them well. He also has another reason to feel special attachment to the tunnel network: his bride from Jordan was recently smuggled through one.
138 2010-01-06 “I think the study could dampen enthusiasm for antidepressant medications a bit, and that may be a good thing,” said Dr. Erick H. Turner, a psychiatrist at Oregon Health and Science University. “People’s expectations for the drugs won’t be so high, and doctors won’t be surprised if they’re not curing every patient they see with medications.”

But Dr. Turner added, “The findings shouldn’t dampen expectations so much that people refuse to even try medication.”

A team of researchers, including psychologists who favor talk therapy and doctors who consult widely with drug makers, performed the new analysis, using government grants. The group evaluated six large drug trials, including 728 men and women, about half of them with severe depression and half with more moderate symptoms.

Three of the trials were of Paxil, from GlaxoSmithKline, a so-called S.S.R.I., and the other three were of imipramine, an older generic drug from the class known as tricyclics. The team, led by Jay C. Fournier and Robert J. DeRubeis of the University of Pennsylvania, found that compared with placebos, the drugs caused a much steeper reduction in symptoms of severe depression (cases scoring 25 or higher on a standard scale of severity, putting them in the top quarter of the sample). Patients with scores of less than 25 got little or no added benefit from the medications.

“We were able to give an overall estimate of effectiveness for the first time in this more moderate severity range, from 14 to 20 on the scale, in which there’s no question that doctors would likely consider prescribing medication,” Dr. DeRubeis said.

His co-authors included Steven D. Hollon and Dr. Richard C. Shelton of Vanderbilt University, Sona Dimidjian of the University of Colorado, Dr. Jan Fawcett of the University of New Mexico and Dr. Jay D. Amsterdam of Penn.

The effects of other popular S.S.R.I.’s like Lexapro and Prozac are not likely to be much different than those of Paxil, experts said.

Dr. DeRubeis and others said antidepressants’ inability to outperform placebos against moderate symptoms stemmed partly from the sustained attention that patients in drug trials received from top doctors — which itself can help relieve symptoms, drug or no drug. For some people, too, the drugs’ side effects may cancel any benefit.

“The message for patients with mild to moderate depression,” Dr. DeRubeis said, “is, ‘Look, medications are always an option, but there’s little evidence that they add to other efforts to shake the depression — whether it’s exercise, seeing the doctor, reading about the disorder or going for psychotherapy.’ ”
139 2010-01-06 As “Avatar” knocks down box office records, the film has hit another, less estimable milestone: it has become the fastest-pirated movie, according to one tracking firm’s figures. The Times of London reported that “Avatar,” starring Zoë Saldana, right, was illegally downloaded 500,000 times in the first two days of its release and 980,000 times in the first week, citing figures from the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks usage of the file-sharing tool BitTorrent. In the days leading up to the film’s release last month, its director, James Cameron, seemed confident that the 3-D effects would essentially make it immune to piracy, telling The Times of London, “You can pirate a 3-D movie, but you can’t pirate it in 3-D, so you can’t bottle that 3-D experience.” But the TorrentFreak.com numbers seem to tell a different story: “Avatar” was illegally downloaded far more often than its closest competitor, the “Twilight” sequel “New Moon,” which was downloaded 610,000 times in its first week of release. Still, 20th Century Fox, which released “Avatar,” seemed unconcerned that piracy would hurt box office grosses, which last weekend surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. “Bootleg copies are unlikely to have much impact,” a studio spokesman told The Times of London. “Seeing the movie in 3-D in a cinema offers an experience that cannot be replicated.”
140 2010-01-06 Walter Mosley, below, the crime novelist best known for his Easy Rawlins mysteries, has adapted his novel “The Tempest Tales” into his first play, “The Fall of Heaven,” which will have its world premiere at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park from Jan. 23 to Feb. 20. The play centers on Tempest Landry, described in a playhouse statement as a streetwise young man from Harlem who is accidentally killed and finds himself in a dispute in heaven with St. Peter, who ultimately sends him back to earth in hopes that Tempest will recognize his mistakes in life. If he does not, heaven will collapse and Satan will reign supreme. Marion McClinton is directing the production; he is best known for his direction of plays by August Wilson, including the Broadway production of “King Hedley II,” for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. David Gallo, who won a Tony in 2006 for best scenic design for the musical “Drowsy Chaperone,” is designing the set. Leland Gantt will star as Tempest. Mr. Mosley is scheduled to hold a discussion of the play at the theater on Jan. 14.
141 2010-01-06 SAN FRANCISCO — Apple encroached upon Google’s turf on Tuesday with its acquisition of Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company.

The sale, which Quattro announced, is the latest sign that the mobile phone is the next battleground for technology companies, particularly for Apple and Google, which are increasingly in competition. Apple paid close to $300 million for Quattro, according to a person briefed on the deal.

While Apple, maker of the iPhone, branched into advertising on Tuesday, Google, which is predominantly an advertising company, began selling its first piece of consumer hardware, the Nexus One cellphone.

“You can just see the tempers rising between the two companies,” said Gene Munster, the senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray covering Internet companies. “Two years ago it was a very friendly relationship. Now just every day it gets more competitive.”

In November, Google agreed to buy AdMob, a mobile advertising network that competed with Quattro, for $750 million. Apple had also been interested in AdMob, according to people with knowledge of that deal. With Quattro, Apple will also compete in the mobile ad market with Microsoft and Yahoo.
142 2010-01-06 The vessel was pretty bare with only an ice room, anchor room, fish hold, eight bunk beds for crew, a stuffy captain’s cabin and no engine. Making the boat inhabitable required the installation of pumps to ensure a fresh water supply, cutting port holes for windows in the former fish hold and engine room (which were transformed into bedrooms) and the installation of kitchens and bathrooms. Mr. Cole, with help from friends, did most of the work himself. “I’ve done all of this with no money,” he said. “It’s just time.”

Almost 15 years later, what he thought would be perfect student lodgings, has now turned into a permanent home. After buying out Mr. Robinson’s half of the boat in 1995, and then moving the boat up river to Vauxhall, where he pays 500 pounds ($800) in moorage fees, he is living on the St. Michael with his dog, a Collie-Lurcher mix, named Bod. Mr. Cole’s son Joe, 14, comes to visit often. New Covent Garden Market, for grocery shopping, and Chelsea, for pubs and restaurants, are steps away.

Over the years, the design of the boat, Mr. Cole said, has “formed organically, shaped by the materials that made themselves available.” An upstairs living room and raised roof garden were built for 200 pounds (around $360) using wood salvaged from a mental asylum in Caterham, Surrey, about 15 miles south of London, that was being demolished. Furniture was bought either second hand, donated to him or found in garbage skips (dumpsters). “In London, there’s much waste and good pickings,” said Mr. Cole, a sculptor. “When I go past a skip now I have to force myself to look away.”

The 110-foot boat was divided into two apartments, one a two-bedroom two-bath and another a four-bedroom two-bath. Both have their own kitchens and sitting rooms. Mr. Cole currently rents out some of the rooms to help cover mooring fees.

What was once the captain’s quarters, at the bow of the ship, is next in line for a facelift. Once finished, this apartment will have direct access to the wooden roof deck. Mr. Cole, who usually resides in the light and spacious two-bedroom apartment, has hunkered down in the bow while he does the works.

Mr. Cole has now made a hobby of renovating boats. Last year, he bought a 120-foot long river barge for 10,000 pounds ($16,000) that he has renovated and plans to put on the market soon.

In the summer, Mr. Cole might be found mowing the lawn on his roof garden as boats sail by, or chugging off in his inflatable craft down the Thames to meet friends at a riverside pub.

Asked if he would ever consider leaving boat life, Mr. Cole doesn’t need to pause long to think. “It doesn’t really have any disadvantages,” he said. “London has become so compressed, with more and more people living in a small area nowadays, and living on the river is really quite an escape.”
143 2010-01-06 The struggling regional airline operator Mesa Air Group said on Tuesday that it had filed for bankruptcy protectionin a Manhattan court in a bid to cut its oversize fleet.

With a fleet size of 130, Mesa has about 52 planes parked and not being used, and it plans to retire 25 more aircraft that are not needed to service its customers, the company said in court papers.

Mesa needs to reduce the fleet to eliminate the significant costs associated with retaining, maintaining and storing excess aircraft, it said.

Mesa’s Hawaiian inter-island low-cost airline joint venture, go!-Mokulele, is not part of the filing and will continue to operate its full flight schedule, it said.

The company, which employs about 3,400, said it would continue to operate as normal during the restructuring. Mesa said it had “ample liquidity” to support itself during the reorganization.
144 2010-01-06 The United States reopened its embassy in Yemen on Tuesday, a day after Yemeni security forces killed two people suspected of being members of Al Qaeda and linked to the threats against several diplomatic outposts.

The United States and Britain had closed their embassies in Sana, Yemen’s capital, on Sunday, citing continuing threats against targets in the city. At the British Embassy, workers returned Tuesday, but the building was closed to visitors. The French, German, Czech and Japanese Embassies were also largely or entirely closed to the public, according to news reports.

A counterterrorism operation by Yemeni forces on Monday had “addressed a specific area of concern,” according to a statement posted on the American Embassy’s Web site. But the statement warned that “the threat of terrorist attacks against American interests remains high” and urged Americans in Yemen to be “vigilant and take prudent security measures.”

On Monday, Yemeni forces were tracking a man they suspected of being a member of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group tied to the attempt to bring down an international flight into Detroit on Christmas Day, when they came under fire from militants in the town of Arhab, officials said. Two bodyguards of the suspect, Nazih al-Hanq, were killed in the firefight; Mr. Hanq escaped.

The United States, which is increasing aid to Yemen, praised the operation. Arhab was the site of one of several strikes made against militants on Dec. 17 that American officials said killed three men suspected of planning suicide attacks on Western targets in Sana.
145 2010-01-06 TOKYO — Japan’s new government braced for another setback Tuesday after reports that its ailing 77-year-old finance minister was pressing to resign, although it appeared that the prime minister might try to persuade him to remain in his job. The news comes at a difficult time — when the government, already weakened by a series of policy blunders and scandals, is attempting the delicate task of stimulating an economy already burdened with enormous debt.

The minister, Hirohisa Fujii, a fiscal conservative trusted by investors, is considered one of the few experienced hands in the cabinet of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party swept to power in September.

Mr. Fujii, who had said he was suffering from exhaustion and high blood pressure, announced early on Tuesday that he was awaiting doctors’ advice on whether he should stay in office.

Early Wednesday, several news agencies reported that Mr. Fujii had decided he wanted to resign, citing unnamed lawmakers from the governing party. But Mr. Hatoyama said he hoped that Mr. Fujii would remain in his post to see the coming fiscal year’s budget through Parliament. He added, however, that he would also respect medical recommendations on the finance minister’s health.

Officials at the Finance Ministry declined to comment.

Mr. Fujii, a veteran bureaucrat turned politician, has been seen by investors as a reassuring check on the left-leaning government’s spending plans. In recent months he has wrangled with ministries over budget cuts as Japan struggles to rein in its runaway public debt, close to twice the size of the country’s economy.

He has repeatedly insisted that the government stick to a $477 billion cap on new bond issuance for the fiscal year starting in April.

151 2010-01-07 Ben Singer (Matthew Broderick), the misanthropic protagonist of Josh Goldin’s film “Wonderful World,” voices many of the frustrations nagging at those who harbor suspicion that the world is going to hell. Ben is a divorced, semi-retired children’s musician and pothead who was once near the top of his field. His career went abruptly into decline when his record company encouraged him to make a solo album, then failed to promote it. Now he toils miserably as a proofreader at a law firm.

Mr. Broderick adopts just the right attitude for the role, slackening his baby face into a permanent sulk and letting his imploring puppy-dog eyes go dead. If Ben’s funk is the grown-up version of a prolonged temper tantrum by a child insisting that the world know how unhappy he is, his barbed observations about greed and injustice still hit home.

After a particularly unpleasant custodial visit with his 11-year-old daughter, Sandra (Jodelle Ferland), she is so fed up that she refuses to see him anymore. There is no love lost between Ben and her mother, Eliza (Ally Walker), who suggests a particularly embittered ex-wife of a Woody Allen character.

But “Wonderful World” has its joyful side. Ben shares a shabby one-room apartment with Ibou (Michael Kenneth Williams), a Senegalese immigrant with whom he spends much of his free time playing chess. (Ibou usually wins.) When Ibou falls into a diabetic coma, his sister Khadi (Sanaa Lathan) appears out of the blue from Dakar, and Ben invites her to stay in Ibou’s half of the apartment. Both the brother and sister are keenly in touch with positive life forces that seem to have deserted Ben. Ibou has faith in the future and believes in magic. And when Khadi and Ben begin an impulsive affair, her spirit begins to rub off on him.

At first “Wonderful World” seems to resist embracing the sentimental cliché of impoverished, life-affirming Africans redeeming the sick soul of a depressed, self-pitying Westerner. But once the improbable affair begins, the movie succumbs to temptation. As Khadi cooks delicious Senegalese meals and teaches Sandra to dance, you are reminded of “The Visitor,” a stronger movie, in which a Syrian musician and a Senegalese street vendor restore the desiccated spirit of a middle-aged college teacher.

175 2010-01-07 Only foolhardy parents would allow their children to provide only the grades on their report cards that they were happy with. Yet hedge funds are given this luxury in reporting their performance to compilers of sectorwide performance indexes. A result is that while a single fund’s track record is clear enough, hedge fund index returns still flatter the average fund in the industry. Investors would be smart to call for a cleanup.

Taken at face value, historic index figures suggest that even an average hedge fund manager can easily beat the stock market while taking less risk. Since 1990, a weighted index of hedge funds has returned around 12 percent annually — about four percentage points more than the returns for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index — with just half the volatility, according to Hedge Fund Research.

On closer inspection, these claims look suspect. Research published in late 2007 by the Princeton professor Burton G. Malkiel showed that many hedge funds simply stopped reporting results after they became embarrassing. For funds that ceased reporting, the average monthly return in the six months before they did so was -0.56 percent. That contrasts with an average monthly return of 0.65 percent during their reporting lives.

The implication is that failing funds drop off the radar before they report even bigger losses or close altogether, thereby excluding their poor performance from indexes. Cases in which a fund’s returns soar before radio silence are much harder to find, research suggests.

Based on Mr. Malkiel’s studies and other academic work, hedge fund investors should probably assume that reported industrywide returns are really as much as four percentage points lower, which makes hedge fund managers look much less special.

This problem of voluntary reporting adds to what is known as survivorship bias, by which poorly performing funds that shut down drop out of the index. Of course, index providers have tried to work out how to deal with flaws of this kind in indexing.

177 2010-01-07 Among the first American women to train as a Roman Catholic theologian, Professor Daly challenged orthodoxies from the start. She came to wide attention in 1968 with the publication of “The Church and the Second Sex” (Harper & Row), in which she argued that the Catholic Church had systematically oppressed women for centuries.

Her next book, “Beyond God the Father: Toward a Philosophy of Women’s Liberation” (Beacon, 1973), explored misogyny in religion in general.

“She is a central figure in 20th-century feminism,” Robin Morgan, the feminist writer and former editor of Ms. magazine, said in a telephone interview on Monday.

Professor Daly’s work was the subject of a critical anthology, “Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly” (Pennsylvania State University, 2000), edited by Sarah Lucia Hoagland and Marilyn Frye.

If Professor Daly’s ideology placed her outside mainstream academic and religious life, then that, by her own account, was where she was glad to be. Formerly a practicing Catholic, she came to regard organized religion as irreparably patriarchal, in later years calling herself “post-Christian.” Where her scholarly concerns had once been largely theological, she gradually came to regard them as spiritual in the broadest sense of the word.

Mary Daly was born in Schenectady, N.Y., on Oct. 16, 1928. By the time she was an adolescent, the natural world seemed to resonate for her in a way it did for few others.

“Especially important was a startling communication from a clover blossom one summer day when I was about 14,” she wrote in an essay in The New Yorker in 1996. “It said, with utmost simplicity, ‘I am.’ ”

After earning a bachelor’s degree in English and Latin from the College of Saint Rose in Albany in 1950, she earned a master’s in English from the Catholic University of America and a Ph.D. in theology from Saint Mary’s College in Notre Dame, Ind. She later earned two more doctorates, in philosophy and theology, from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.

Professor Daly joined the Boston College faculty in 1966. In 1969, in a widely reported case, she was denied tenure, a development interpreted by many as a response to “The Church and the Second Sex.” After more than 1,500 students signed a petition supporting her — most were men, for the college did not admit women to its liberal arts division until 1970 — she was reinstated with tenure.

In 1999, when Professor Daly and Boston College parted company, a spokesman for the college said she had agreed to retire. She maintained she was forced to retire.

Critics alternately praised and condemned Professor Daly for her pyrotechnic, bitingly witty, eccentrically capitalized and punctuated style.

Most were enchanted by “Websters’ First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language” (Beacon, 1987; with Jane Caputi). A lexicon of new, nonsexist English, the book contains original coinages, like “Mister-ectomy” (“a guaranteed solution to The Contraception Problem”), plus familiar pejoratives like “crone” and “hag,” rehabilitated as emblems of pride.

But some reviewers seemed discomforted by Professor Daly’s later prose, which appeared to dovetail ever more snugly with New Age rhetoric:

“Although I was not in a ‘trance’ when writing ‘Gyn/Ecology,’ I was in a special mode of creative consciousness, which stemmed, in part, from a will to overcome all phallocratically imposed fears and Move on the Journey of Gynocentric Creation,” she wrote in the 1990 edition of “Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism” (Beacon), originally published in 1978.

Her other books include “Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy” (Beacon, 1984) and “Outercourse: The Be-Dazzling Voyage: Containing Recollections From My Logbook of a Radical Feminist Philosopher (Be-ing an Account of My Time/Space Travels and Ideas — Then, Again, Now, and How)” (HarperSanFrancisco, 1992).

Reviewing “Pure Lust” in The New York Times Book Review in 1984, the religious-studies scholar Demaris Wehr wrote: “Mary Daly is an extraordinary woman and this is an extraordinary work, demanding unusual spiritual and intellectual effort from its readers. The effort is worth it.”

Ms. Wehr added, “Her powerful mind, her creative genius and her uncanny ability to put her finger on deep emotional, psychological and spiritual problems are ignored at our peril.”
178 2010-01-07 “This is irresponsible at best and pernicious at worst,” Nicholas A. Ashford, a professor of technology and policy at the , said of the new efforts to marry cars and computers. “Unfortunately and sadly, it is a continuation of the pursuit of profit over safety — for both drivers and pedestrians.”

One system on the way this fall from Audi lets drivers pull up information as they drive. Heading to for a basketball game? Pop down the touch pad, finger-scribble the word “Knicks” and get a entry on the arena, photos and reviews of nearby restaurants, and animations of the ways to get there.

A notice that pops up when the Audi system is turned on reads: “Please only use the online services when traffic conditions allow you to do so safely.”

The technology and car companies say that safety remains a priority. They note that they are building in or working on technology like voice commands and screens that can simultaneously show a map to the driver and a movie to a front-seat passenger, as in the new .

“We are trying to make that driving experience one that is very engaging,” said Jim Buczkowski, the director of global electrical and electronics systems engineering at . “We also want to make sure it is safer and safer. It is part of what our DNA will be going forward.”

Ford’s new MyFord system lets the driver adjust temperature settings or call a friend while the car is in motion, while its built-in Web browser works only when the car is parked. Audi says it will similarly restrict access to complex and potentially distracting functions. But in general, drivers will bear much of the responsibility for limiting their use of these devices.

Computer chips and other components improve every year while dropping in cost, allowing carmakers to introduce more sophisticated devices. Harman, based in Stamford, Conn., and a maker of such systems for cars, has created a pair of high-end multimedia systems due out this year that use full-fledged PC chips from Intel and . Such chips once consumed too much electricity to be used in cars.

“We have always looked at the PC market with envy,” said Sachin Lawande, the chief technology officer at Harman, which works with Audi, , Mercedes, and others. “They’ve always had these great chips we could not use, but now that’s changing.”

A complex new dashboard console from Ford, which it plans to unveil Thursday, brings the car firmly into the land of electronic gadgets. The 4.2-inch color screen to the left of the speedometer displays information about the car, like the fuel level, while a companion screen on the right shows things like the name of a cellphone caller or the title of the digital song file being played. An eight-inch touch screen tops the central console, displaying things like control panels and, when the car is not moving, Web pages.

The system has Wi-Fi capability, two U.S.B. ports and a place to plug in a keyboard — in short, many of the features of a standard PC.

The automakers’ efforts are backed by companies that make chips for PCs and that want to see their processors slotted into the 70 million cars sold worldwide each year.

“Cars are going to become probably the most immersive consumer electronics device we have,” said Michael Rayfield, a general manager at Nvidia, a chip company that on Thursday plans to announce a deal with Audi. “In 2010, you will sit in these things, and it will be a totally different experience.”

The giants of the industry contend they are giving consumers what they want — and the things that smartphones and the Internet have trained them to expect.

“Customers are expecting more and more, especially business people who expect to find in the car what they find in their smartphone,” said Mathias Halliger, the chief engineer for Audi’s multimedia interface systems. “We should give them the same or a better experience.”

The muscle of the computer industry adds powerful new backing to efforts by carmakers to introduce new technologies as a source of profit. Once they promoted advanced stereos, but now navigation and integrated phone systems are the hot items.

“Carmakers assume, as most consumers do, that most cars are alike in terms of line quality and safety, and all the old attributes,” Art Spinella, an auto industry analyst with CNW Research, said. “Now the way to distinguish yourself is through higher tech.”

“But they’re totally ignoring one of the key issues of the future of driving, which is distracted driving.”

Awareness of that issue is growing. Even in 2003, when fewer people were multitasking in cars, researchers at Harvard estimated that motorists talking on cellphones caused 2,600 fatal accidents and 570,000 accidents involving injuries a year.

Charlie Klauer, a researcher at the Transportation Institute, says motorists face a much greater crash risk when looking at a screen, even if it is just a simple GPS map. She says the overall danger for drivers will rise as screens deliver additional streams of data.

The longer a motorist looks away from the road, “the risk of crash or near crash goes up exponentially — not a linear increase, but exponentially,” Ms. Klauer said. “So when you start introducing things like e-mail, Internet access, restaurant options or anything like that, the risk goes up.”

Regulators worry about the developments, too. , the transportation secretary, said the companies involved were on the wrong track.

“The idea they’re going to load automobiles up with all kinds of ways to be distracted — that’s not the direction we’re going, and I will speak out against it,” he said.

The companies contend that they are creating helpful systems that display crucial information. And they are quick to point out that more computing power could mean better safety technology as well, like sensors that try to predict dangerous driving situations.

Ford and Audi say they extensively tested and tweaked their systems to cut down on the amount of time that drivers spend looking at screens. Brad Stertz, a spokesman for Audi of America, said that this testing was voluntary.

“Because a lot of this is so new, there’s not a ton of regulatory testing that’s required, like would be required with crash testing,” Mr. Stertz said. He added that the company was also hoping to avoid legal troubles, saying, “It could be a legal issue if someone gets into a car accident and the cops blame the car company for a system that’s too elaborate.”

Darrin Shewchuk, a spokesman for Harman, said his company was working on safety technology like voice systems for listening to and composing e-mail messages. But he said that “generally speaking, the safety testing is really the responsibility of the automakers.”
179 2010-01-07 SEEN from Tokyo, America’s relationship with Japan faces a crisis. The immediate problem is deadlock over a plan to move an American military base on the island of Okinawa. It sounds simple, but this is an issue with a long back story that could create a serious rift with one of our most crucial allies.

When I was in the Pentagon more than a decade ago, we began planning to reduce the burden that our presence places on Okinawa, which houses more than half of the 47,000 American troops in Japan. The Marine Corps Air Station Futenma was a particular problem because of its proximity to a crowded city, Ginowan. After years of negotiation, the Japanese and American governments agreed in 2006 to move the base to a less populated part of Okinawa and to move 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014.

The plan was thrown into jeopardy last summer when the Japanese voted out the Liberal Democratic Party that had governed the country for nearly half a century in favor of the Democratic Party of Japan. The new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, leads a government that is inexperienced, divided and still in the thrall of campaign promises to move the base off the island or out of Japan completely.

The Pentagon is properly annoyed that Mr. Hatoyama is trying to go back on an agreement that took more than a decade to work out and that has major implications for the Marine Corps’ budget and force realignment. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates expressed displeasure during a trip to Japan in October, calling any reassessment of the plan “counterproductive.” When he visited Tokyo in November, President Obama agreed to a high-level working group to consider the Futenma question. But since then, Mr. Hatoyama has said he will delay a final decision on relocation until at least May.

Not surprisingly, some in Washington want to play hardball with the new Japanese government. But that would be unwise, for Mr. Hatoyama is caught in a vise, with the Americans squeezing from one side and a small left-wing party (upon which his majority in the upper house of the legislature depends) threatening to quit the coalition if he makes any significant concessions to the Americans. Further complicating matters, the future of Futenma is deeply contentious for Okinawans.

Even if Mr. Hatoyama eventually gives in on the base plan, we need a more patient and strategic approach to Japan. We are allowing a second-order issue to threaten our long-term strategy for East Asia. Futenma, it is worth noting, is not the only matter that the new government has raised. It also speaks of wanting a more equal alliance and better relations with China, and of creating an East Asian community — though it is far from clear what any of this means.
180 2010-01-07 Mr. Nussbaumer, who has been looking at the same minority-representation numbers, independently of the Columbia clinic, has become increasingly concerned about the large percentage of minority applicants shut out of law schools.

“A big part of it is that many schools base their admissions criteria not on whether students have a reasonable chance of success, but how those L.S.A.T. numbers are going to affect their rankings in the U.S. News & World Report,” Mr. Nussbaumer said. “Deans get fired if the rankings drop, so they set their L.S.A.T. requirements very high.

“We’re living proof that it doesn’t have to be that way, that those students with the slightly lower L.S.A.T. scores can graduate, pass the bar and be terrific lawyers.”

Margaret Martin Barry, co-president of the Society of American Law Teachers, said that while she understood the importance of rankings, law schools must address the issue of diversity. “If you’re so concerned with rankings, you’re going to lose a whole generation,” she said.

The Columbia study found that among the 46,500 law school matriculants in the fall of 2008, there were 3,392 African-Americans, or 7.3 percent, and 673 Mexican-Americans, or 1.4 percent. Among the 43,520 matriculants in 1993, there were 3,432 African-Americans, or 7.9 percent, and 710 Mexican-Americans, or 1.6 percent. The study, whose findings are detailed at the Web site A Disturbing Trend in Law School Diversity, relied on the admission council’s minority categories, which track Mexican-Americans separately from Puerto Ricans and Hispanic/Latino students.

“We focused on the two groups, African-Americans and Mexican-Americans, who did not make progress in law school representation during the period,” Mr. Johnson said. “The Hispanic/Latino group did increase, from 3.1 percent of the matriculants in 1993, to 5.1 percent in 2008.”

Mr. Johnson said he did not have a good explanation for the disparity, particularly since the 2008 LSAT scores among Mexican-Americans were, on average, one point higher than those of the Hispanics, and one point lower in 1993.

Over all, Mr. Johnson said, it is puzzling that minority enrollment in law schools has fallen, even since the United States Supreme Court ruled in 2003, in Grutter v. Bollinger, that race can be taken into account in law school admissions because the diversity of the student body is a compelling state interest.

“Someone told me that things had actually gotten worse since the Grutter decision, and that’s what got us started looking at this,” Mr. Johnson said. “Many people are not aware of the numbers, even among those interested in diversity issues. For many African-American and Mexican-American students, law school is an elusive goal.”
181 2010-01-07 That ride, Mr. Blyskal writes, “starts with dramatizations of a problem you didn’t know you had, followed by the incredible solution, then a series of ever more amazing product benefits, bonuses, and giveaways, all leading to the final thrilling plunge of an unbelievably low price.”

Among products the article says are not worth buying are the Snuggie, ShamWow, Debbie Meyer Green Bags for food storage, and the Garry Ultra Light vacuum, which testers said fell short of advertised claims and, even when they had some good attributes, were overpriced.

The only two items that passed muster: the PedEgg, a foot file that traps shavings in a compartment and costs about $10, and the Magic Jack, a phone device using voice over Internet protocol.

The recession has had a silver lining for direct-response advertisers, who found they could afford to advertise on TV in prime time rather than late at night after banks and automakers curtailed their advertising and ad rates dropped.

None of the latest crop of infomercials has been a bigger sensation than the Snuggie, which draws derision and awe in equal measure. It has been mocked by television hosts like Jay Leno, Jon Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres, donned at Snuggie pub crawls across the country, parodied in videos on YouTube, and idolized on Facebook, where the Snuggie page has more than 77,000 fans.

In the soon-to-be-published book, “Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It),” the author William Poundstone writes that the central principle of infomercials is what the economist Richard Thaler calls “Don’t wrap all the Christmas presents in one box,” meaning that consumers value freebies that come with a purchased item more than purchasing the same items presented as a set.

“Thaler deduced that marketers should devote less energy to promoting how absolutely wonderful their product is, and more to breaking it down, feature by feature, or selling several products in one bundle,” Mr. Poundstone writes. “The one thing you can’t buy in an infomercial is one thing.”

The Snuggie infomercial first plugs the sleeved blanket, then throws in a free book light, announcing the price is $19.95, plus $7.95 for postage and handling, then adds that a buyer also will receive a second Snuggie and second book light for an additional $7.95 for postage and handling. It was compulsory to order two Snuggies and two book lights for a total of $35.85, plus tax, though that actual price was never mentioned. Although now also offered by retailers like Walgreens, the Snuggie is still applauded by direct marketers. In September, Allstar Marketing Group of Hawthorne, N.Y., which markets the Snuggie and other products like the children’s toy Bendaroos, was named marketer of the year by Direct Response Marketing Alliance, a trade group.

Consumer Reports, however, was not impressed. Testers complained that the Snuggie was so cumbersome that walking in it was difficult, that its sleeves, despite being marketed as “perfect for men, women and children,” were too long for shorter adult testers, and that the gaping opening in the back “left their backside uncovered, though it kept other parts toasty.”

The magazine also washed the Snuggies, advertised as having “ultrasoft thick luxurious fleece.”

The article stated, “Each time we laundered two Snuggies, we removed a sandwich bag’s worth of lint from the dryer screen. After 10 washings, “the fabric had bare spots between pills and clumps.”

When asked to comment on the Consumer Reports article, Allstar said in a written statement that, “We stand behind the Snuggie 100 percent. More than 20 million people have purchased a Snuggie blanket and we frequently receive comments from consumers telling us they love their Snuggie.”

As for the laundering, “all blankets shed to an extent when being laundered,” the statement continued. “Because the Snuggie is designed to be used like a blanket, you typically don’t have to wash it as often as you would clothing.”

Consumer Reports has 3.9 million subscribers and newsstand sales of 140,000, but how much its opinion of the Snuggie will sting is an open question.

“It will certainly hurt the people who are going to read Consumer Reports to decide if they want to buy a Snuggie,” said Mr. Poundstone, the author. “But that’s a pretty small segment of the Snuggie audience, I would think.”
182 2010-01-07 The goal is not only to help individual owners grow and create a peer network group, but to help cities thrive.

“Eighty percent of business development is focused on start-ups, and only 20 percent of start-ups survive,” said J. Jean Horstman, the chief executive of Inner City Entrepreneurs. “These business owners have been in the trenches, and they need to climb up onto a ridge and see where they fit.”

The program offers what it calls a “Streetwise M.B.A.” Owners use their own companies as case studies and must write a three-year growth plan for a final project.

The classes teach fundamentals that many executives, despite having owned a business, are often unfamiliar with, like hiring, financial planning, marketing and styles of management. Some skills come naturally, and others do not, Ms. Horstman said. Many companies, for instance, have trouble putting in place a marketing plan, she said, because they are afraid of too much self-promotion.

Companies must apply to the program, which charges a $3,000 fee. Classes typically have 10 to 15 students, although just eight enrolled this year because of the troubled economy. A diverse pool is then chosen — someone with marketing experience might be in a class with a florist, machine shop owner or head of a wind power company — allowing students to share their expertise. The program also offers a peer network of alumni for participants to consult.

While the instructor guides the discussions, class members are encouraged to ask one another questions and share their own experiences.

“It’s a combination of an actual educational program where there’s course work, reading materials and networking that goes on around small businesses and local business organizations,” Mr. Whitmore said. “That’s really the powerful blend of ingredients that they bring to the table.”

The program expanded to Worcester, Mass., in 2007 and Lowell, Mass., this year. It worked with the Small Business Administration in 2008 — the agency uses the program’s curriculum in 15 cities nationwide as part of its Emerging 200 Entrepreneurship program, which helps existing businesses grow.

“People are more likely to have success and sustainability if they have solid management and technical assistance, not only at the beginning, but during the life cycle of a business,” said Ellen Thrasher, director of the office of entrepreneurship education at the S.B.A. “There are opportunities, even in an economy that’s struggling.”

Arthur Eberle, owner of Compliance Assurance Associates, an environmental services company in Memphis, said he took the class last year to help in the transition from sole proprietorship to a larger company.

Mr. Eberle said the class provided him with invaluable advice on hiring and firing employees.

Mr. Eberle said he recently hired a bookkeeper because the course helped him realize that he needed someone to handle the financials so he could focus on the direction of the company.

“I have an M.B.A. in marketing and I really think they did as good a job in that course as the four years I spent working on my M.B.A.,” Mr. Eberle said. “My M.B.A., frankly, was targeted theory and how they work in a Fortune 500 company. If I worked at Procter & Gamble, it would be fine, but I don’t.”

Mr. Whitmore said he asked his classmates whether he should hire an experienced marketing manager: “Is now the time to hire a $60,000 or $70,000 sales director?”

Taza, Mr. Whitmore’s company, produces fair trade chocolate. It has 25 employees, most of whom he hired “on the cheap,” but who are still “excited about what we’re doing.”

“They say when you pay with peanuts you hire monkeys, but we have some smart monkeys,” Mr. Whitmore said. “I’m not experienced as a marketing director. I don’t know what I’m doing. I want to hire someone with experience and pay them what they deserve, which is a lot of money.”

Kevin Low, who runs Secured Network Services, a computer business in Norwood, Mass., asked Mr. Whitmore if he considered paying the employee a smaller base salary that is more in line with others at the company and offering incentives based on profit and revenue.

“Your traditional salesperson may not fit in with your culture,” Mr. Low said. “Maybe someone will be willing to take less peanuts but you can reward them with additional incentives.”

Mr. Whitmore took the advice, and said it changed how he was going about the hiring. Instead of posting the position on a job Web site, he said, he started to look for candidates at networking events. The company has interviewed several candidates and will make a decision by the end of this month.

“If we find the right person that really wants to be a part of a company like ours and a culture like ours, we can provide value for that employee, and a sense of belonging and fulfillment that money can’t provide,” Mr. Whitmore said.
183 2010-01-07 The New York insurance superintendent, James J. Wrynn, said it would be easier for New York to create an insurance exchange than for most other states because it tried to start such an exchange in the 1980s. That attempt failed, but the laws allowing it are still on the books, Mr. Wrynn said.

He said the 1980s effort was doomed because the companies participating were not required to have adequate capital and did not always understand the risks they were taking on. The market was also “soft” then, meaning the participating insurers had a hard time charging large enough premiums to both cover their risks and turn a profit.

Mr. Wrynn said New York had been studying what went wrong with the earlier exchange and would see to it that the mistakes were not repeated. He said the state was about to start working with people from various financial institutions in the private sector to draft the rules and procedures for the exchange. Members of the working groups are to be named on Thursday.

Another crucial difference between the 1980s and now is the rise of hedge funds and other unconventional financial companies, which might want to try insuring catastrophic risks to balance investment portfolios. Such investors would participate directly in insurance syndicates, underwriting risks without having to become licensed insurers.

By forming syndicates, participants would be able to buy into relatively small slices of certain risks. The idea would be that the syndicate as a whole would have the capacity to absorb huge losses that might topple an insurance company working on its own.

In addition to hedge funds, private equity firms, banks and wealthy individuals might want to participate. Licensed insurance companies might also want to participate, officials said. If, for example, a homeowner’s insurance company decided its coverage was too heavily concentrated on the coasts of Florida, it could come to the New York exchange and seek an exchange to assume some of the risks, spreading them over a bigger pool.
184 2010-01-07 Since 2007, the F.D.A. has held three advisory panel meetings on these drugs and has changed the labels of the drugs to warn of risks and lower the doses used.

Sales of Aranesp are expected to fall to below $3 billion in 2009 from $4.1 billion in 2006. Sales of Epogen, used only for kidney dialysis patients, have held steady at about $2.5 billion a year.

Amgen said in a statement on Wednesday that the commentary in the medical journal “highlighted areas of incomplete understanding” regarding use of the anemia drugs.

Amgen’s shares fell 43 cents to close at $56.79. Shares of Johnson & Johnson, which is less dependent on the anemia drugs, rose 52 cents to close at $64.45.

The newest concern was prompted by results of a study called “Treat,” which were published Oct. 30 in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The trial, planned in 2004 before the safety concerns intensified, aimed to see if using Aranesp to increase the red blood cell levels of people with diabetes and kidney disease would prevent death and cardiovascular problems.

The trial found that there was no statistically significant difference in deaths and cardiovascular problems between patients who received Aranesp and those who received a placebo.

While that represented a failure of the original goal of helping people, that the drug did not kill people was considered somewhat reassuring in light of the safety questions that had arisen between the time the trial started and when it ended.

But those who took Aranesp had about double the rates of stroke.

Dr. Ellis F. Unger, deputy director of the F.D.A. office that regulates renal and cardiovascular drugs, said in an interview that the agency published its commentary in the medical journal to inform doctors of the risks.

“One should not misinterpret Treat as being reassuring,” he said.

Others have also called for caution. Dr. Ajay K. Singh of Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School said that avoiding the use of the drugs in kidney patients not undergoing dialysis “is now the soundest approach given the remarkable observations from the Treat study.” He made the remarks in a commentary published online recently by The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

An advisory panel to Medicare is also scheduled to meet in March to discuss coverage of the anemia drugs when they are used for patients with kidney disease. And Medicare is shifting how it pays for dialysis in a way that is expected to reduce the use of such drugs.
185 2010-01-07 UNITED NATIONS — Kai Eide, the departing United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, warned the Security Council on Wednesday that an emphasis on security matters over social issues would doom international efforts to stabilize the country.

“The political strategy is too often shaped as an appendix to military thinking,” Mr. Eide said.

Although Mr. Eide, a Norwegian, did not mention the United States by name, his comments appeared to be an oblique criticism of the recent American-led focus on a military surge, with the Obama administration committing another 30,000 troops there and some allies increasing their forces as well.

Rosemary A. DiCarlo, the American envoy addressing the Security Council, noted that the United States planned to triple the number of civilians sent to help with reconstruction and economic and agricultural development; the number will grow to 1,000 experts from 320 now.

But Mr. Eide said the growing impatience among the countries contributing troops and aid, the frustration of Afghans that so many promises had gone unmet and the Taliban resurgence had the potential to bring chaos.

“If these negative trends are not reversed and reversed soon, then there is a danger that the combination of them will become unmanageable,” he said.
186 2010-01-07 FLORHAM PARK, N.J.  A large man, even by N.F.L. standards, moved alone through the Jets’ practice complex Wednesday, wearing a T-shirt, gym shorts and running shoes instead of a green jersey, pads and a helmet.

The Jets somehow have forged ahead without Kris Jenkins, the 340-pound nose tackle who served as the foundation of their defense until he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a loss to Buffalo on Oct. 18. Lost for the season, he jokes that he is on vacation now.

Jenkins plans to watch the Jets’ playoff game Saturday against the Cincinnati Bengals on TV at home because his knee, surgically repaired, has not recovered to the point that he could stand on the sideline and watch. He cannot absorb even a glancing blow.

“It’s a safety issue,” Jenkins said as he put his workout clothes in a laundry bag. “Like I’ve said, I need to heal.”

He said he was not surprised the Jets finished as the No. 1-ranked defense in the league without him. Sione Pouha, Howard Green, Marques Douglas and Mike DeVito have stood in for Jenkins during his absence, and he said all four had played well.

In fact, the Jets have given up an average of 88.4 rushing yards in the 10 games Jenkins missed, compared with 115.7 in the six games he played.

Getting hurt, Jenkins said, was a bad thing  but a good thing, too.

“You have to understand that a football team is not just one superstar  not that I’m a superstar, but it’s just one of those things, we need that chemistry,” he said.

Referring to his injury, Jenkins said: “It was just that spark that pulled the guys together. It’s been at my expense, but it can’t be about one individual. It’s a group of guys. I knew they would step up. We understand what we have here. It’s not a popularity contest.”

His teammates see him every day in the locker room as his rehabilitation continues. Jenkins laughed when he said playing on the defensive line was not like reinventing the wheel, but he will offer advice when asked. The Jets seem to be doing fine without him, though.

“I still wish he could fly to the games, and I wish he could stand on the sidelines, because a veteran player like him can see things we don’t see on the field,” Douglas said.

The Jets’ defensive line will be tested Saturday. The Bengals like to run the ball, and Cedric Benson, their leading rusher, will return to action after missing the 37-0 loss to the Jets last Sunday.

David Harris, the Jets’ middle linebacker and leading tackler, did not practice again Wednesday because of a sprained ankle, although Coach Rex Ryan said, “I think he’ll go just because he’s the guy he is.”

Pouha, who replaced Jenkins in the starting lineup, said: “I don’t think there can be a chip on your shoulder when you have the No. 1 defense in the world. I don’t think we have anything to prove to ourselves.”

Maybe they do. Mike Pettine, the defensive coordinator, said he thought that the word “journeymen”  referring to the defensive linemen without Jenkins  was still written in the line’s meeting room at the complex.

“They refused to be the weak link,” Pettine said.

“I’m still a part of this team, and that’s not going to change,” Jenkins said. “I’ll be honest with you: If we win the Super Bowl, I’m going to wear that ring proudly, even though I did only play in six games.”
187 2010-01-07 Experts say that light does help the body reset its clock. Melatonin is excreted by the pineal gland in the brain, and appears to tell the body when it is night.

“You can trick the body clock into thinking it’s dark out by taking a melatonin pill,” said Dr. Alfred J. Lewy, professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health & Science University.

There have been some clinical trials showing that melatonin can help combat jet lag, but some experts say further studies are needed.

Drug companies have little incentive to perform such tests because melatonin is not patented. But some companies have developed patented compounds that mimic melatonin by binding to the same receptors in the brain as the hormone.

One melatonin mimic, Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Rozerem, is already approved for the treatment of insomnia.

In a jet lag trial in which participants were flown from Hawaii to the East Coast, Rozerem improved how people felt. But it did not improve how well they functioned, for instance, in their reaction times and recall of information, said Kenneth P. Wright Jr., associate professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado and an investigator in the trial.

A spokeswoman for Takeda said the company had no plans to seek approval of Rozerem, also known as ramelteon, as a treatment for jet lag.

Vanda Pharmaceuticals of Rockville, Md., sponsored two clinical trials of its melatonin mimic, called tasimelteon, that used laboratory simulations rather than actual travel. Results, published last year in the British medical journal Lancet, indicated that the drug shifted internal time clocks and improved people’s ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Dr. Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, Vanda’s chief executive, said the company was debating whether to do another jet-lag trial — this time with real travel — or instead to test the drug as a treatment for other circadian rhythm disorders that would require daily, rather than just occasional, use of the drug.

One new use, he said, might be for free-running disorder, which affects blind people who cannot sense light at all. They therefore cannot recalibrate their body clocks, which get progressively out of sync with their daily routines.

Another is delayed sleep phase disorder, a condition experienced by many night owls who have difficulty falling asleep until very late at night or early in the morning.

A surprise candidate for a jet-lag remedy could be Viagra, the blue erectile-dysfunction pill. Scientists in Argentina reported in 2007 that sildenafil, the active chemical in Viagra, could speed the adjustment of the body clock in hamsters.

Pfizer, which sells Viagra, says it does not think the drug is very active in the brain and has no intention of testing it for that purpose.
188 2010-01-07 In the current vogue of ballet programs arranged by theme (All Tchaikovsky! Love stories! Leotard ballets!) it’s easy to pine for the old days, when works with seemingly little in common lent a certain hot-and-cold balance to a night at Lincoln Center. On Tuesday evening the New York City Ballet opened its winter repertory season with such a disparate double-header: Peter Martins’s “Naïve and Sentimental Music,” followed by George Balanchine’s “Who Cares?” from 1970.

Mr. Martins’s ballet, set to the title score by John Adams, was every bit as ponderous as it was at its November premiere. The work for 26 dancers (all but one a principal) is less a fluid ballet than an assemblage of jagged poses without a riveting structure to anchor the music. Glimmers of individual dancing shine through — Sara Mearns’s tranquil pointwork or the way Jennie Somogyi throws her head back and lingers in an arch — but much of the three-section work is so stilted that by the time the final movement, “Chain to the Rhythm,” rolls around, the couples just seem shackled.

Even so, it’s worth sitting through “Naïve and Sentimental Music” for “Who Cares?” featuring a sparkling new cast and the return of its penultimate number, “Clap Yo’ Hands,” set to a 1926 recording by George Gershwin. (“Clap” hasn’t been seen at City Ballet since the 1970s.) In “Who Cares?” Balanchine pays glittering homage to Manhattan with a classical ballet set to 17 songs by Gershwin, as orchestrated by Hershy Kay. Appropriately, the action unfolds in front of a backdrop of sprouting skyscrapers.

“Who Cares?” starts and ends with a celebration of ensemble dancing, but the heart of the ballet begins with the scintillating duet, “The Man I Love” for Tiler Peck, a haunting vision in pink as she glides across the floor in delicate traveling steps, and Robert Fairchild, a charming, athletic romantic lead. Ms. Peck and Mr. Fairchild started out as jazz dancers; “Who Cares?” fits both like a second skin.

In “Fascinatin’ Rhythm” Ms. Peck dances with impeccable timing — her musicality is full of wit and a teasing sensuality — and Mr. Fairchild, in “Liza,” flits around the stage with a playful lilt, snapping his fingers, winding his elbows and springing into the air with easy beats. Sterling Hyltin, as the woman in red, is a kittenish vixen, while Ana Sophia Scheller, in blue, is razor sharp in terms of accuracy, but hampered by a cheerful blandness in her performance quality.

Yet it’s here, in the ballet’s duets and solos, that the intimacy of nightlife comes alive. For the newly reinserted “Clap Yo’ Hands” the three lead women, under dusty spotlights, kick their legs as the scratchy recording plays. After Mr. Fairchild joins in, they hold hands and create a human maze, ducking under arms and winding in circles until unfurling with a ripple. “Clap Yo’ Hands” provides a bridge from one world to another — the robust finale, “I Got Rhythm” — and even in your seat, you can’t help but skip happily along.
189 2010-01-07 ¶You’re not inclined to invest in growth. You may be comfortable with the current size and profitability of your business and have no desire to make the capital expenditures necessary to take it to the next level.

¶You feel your management skills are overmatched. It is not uncommon for business owners to build their business to a certain point and then realize they lack the skill set required to go further.

Many owners have no idea. On one end of the spectrum, for example, was a client who owned a professional services firm. She felt the firm was worth more than $1 million. After a lengthy search, a buyer paid her less than half that amount. Then there was a client who was about to sell his I.T. company to an employee for $200,000. After advertising the business for sale nationwide, he sold it for one dollar shy of $1 million.

Selling a business is both art and science, and in no other area is this more evident than the valuation. While every seller wants to achieve maximum value, setting an asking price that is too high signals to buyers that you may not be serious about selling.

While there are a number of methods used to value a business, the most common formula for smaller transactions is a multiple of seller’s discretionary earnings (S.D.E.). This type of market-based valuation involves recasting profit-and-loss statements — adding back owner’s salary, perks and nonrecurring expenses — to find the S.D.E. of the business and then using comparable data for similar businesses to arrive at an appropriate multiple.

Prepare Your Business for Sale (Now!)

Another client owned a popular sports bar and grill. He’d made repairs to some of his kitchen equipment, brought his books current and determined a reasonable asking price. He got an inquiry from a serious buyer — an industry veteran on a nationwide buying spree with his partner. The buyer liked everything about the business, and asked for data from his point-of-sale system, which my client was unable to produce quickly. By the time he assembled the information, the buyer had made an offer on a similar business in another state.

There is no way to overstate the intensity with which buyers will scrutinize your business. But here are things you can do to put your best foot forward.

First, get your books in order. Not being able to provide accurate financial statements in a timely manner can cause a deal to unravel in short order. Be sure to have the following on hand before you go to market:

Be ready to furnish other documentation — particularly during the due diligence phase — when you will probably be asked to produce insurance policies, employment agreements, customer contracts, lists of patents issued, equipment leases and bank statements.

You will also want to spruce up your business to make it attractive to buyers. Make any needed cosmetic improvements to the premises, get rid of outdated inventory and make sure that equipment is in good working order.

Not surprisingly, most savvy buyers use the Internet to research available businesses for sale. The two largest Web sites are BizBuySell.com and BizQuest.com. Some sites specialize in selling certain kinds of businesses like franchises, Internet properties or restaurants. Most of these sites charge a monthly subscription fee to advertise your business for sale.

There are two primary marketing materials that are typically used to describe your business to potential buyers. The first is a one-page document that offers highlights of the business without revealing its identity and is sometimes referred to as a “blind profile.” The second is a comprehensive selling memorandum or prospectus to be sent to serious buyers who have signed a confidentiality agreement.

There’s no bigger waste of time than working with a buyer who will not be able to complete a transaction. Ideally, you will want all interested buyers to sign a confidentiality agreement before sending out anything other than the “blind profile” for your business. In addition, you should require buyers to submit some basic information:

¶Funds available to invest and sources of financing.

¶Reason for interest in your business.

After you’ve found a qualified buyer, provided a selling memorandum and had an initial meeting, it will be time to stop the flow of information and ask that an offer be presented. This can take the form of a nonbinding letter of intent or a term sheet. It should spell out the primary terms of a deal so that all parties can move forward in good faith.

My client ended up receiving three offers on her professional services firm. One was from a competitor, one was from an industry expert residing out of the country and one was from a regional firm looking to extend its geographic footprint. While that last offer was the weakest from a financial standpoint, we knew that this buyer would be able to complete a seamless transition and build her business. We decided to negotiate with the regional firm.

The asking price was $500,000. The regional firm offered a disappointing $400,000, with $50,000 down and the balance financed by the seller over five years at 6 percent interest. My client planned to stay with the firm under new ownership and was relatively certain that gross sales would increase substantially when her company became part of a regional brand. She offered a counter proposal: In lieu of financing the balance of $350,000, she asked to receive 10 percent of gross monthly sales for five years. She conservatively estimated that she would realize an additional $108,000 -- over and above the selling price of $400,000 -- at the end of the five-year period using this deal structure. Both parties accepted.

All sellers hope to get a full-price cash offer for their business. But in the real world this rarely happens. More often buyers will make a down payment and then pay some or all of the remainder in installments to either you or a lender. Don’t be dismayed by an offer that doesn’t meet your original expectations. As this case illustrates, a willingness to be creative with the terms of a transaction can go a long way toward a successful sale. Be sure to enlist an accountant and a lawyer to help you assess the tax consequences of the terms you suggest or accept.

Selling a business is largely about setting realistic expectations, avoiding surprises and just plain hanging in there. It can be an arduous journey, but one with a very tangible (and rewarding) light at the end of the tunnel. Once you’ve successfully sold your business, savor an accomplishment that not every entrepreneur gets to enjoy. Whether you’re lying on the beach, retiring by the lake or starting your next venture, you did it!
190 2010-01-07 TOKYO — Dealing another blow to the fledgling government, the Japanese finance minister resigned Wednesday, leaving Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama to appoint a successor with little fiscal experience to grapple with financing an ambitious campaign agenda, a growing public debt and a fading economic recovery.

Deputy Prime Minister Naoto Kan, a founder of the governing Democratic Party and the minister in charge of economic policy and state strategy, will succeed the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, Mr. Hatoyama said.

Mr. Fujii, 77, cited fatigue and deteriorating health as the reasons for his resignation, which was tendered just as the government was preparing to shepherd through Parliament a record $1 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in April.

Mr. Kan, 63, a former activist and champion of reducing the authority of bureaucrats, is seen as having the political influence but none of the financial expertise of Mr. Fujii. A fiscal conservative and former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, Mr. Fujii was considered a valuable experienced hand in the cabinet of Mr. Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party came to power in September.

Investors saw Mr. Fujii as a reassuring check on the left-leaning government’s spending plans. In recent months he had wrangled with ministries over budget cuts as Japan struggled to restrain its public debt, which is close to twice the size of the gross domestic product.

219 2010-01-08 After nearly a decade of delays, federal officials began allowing the visas en masse only early last year, after sustained efforts from immigrant rights groups, particularly several based in Oakland and San Francisco. The pace of approvals has since stepped up, as has the controversy, with both defense lawyers and groups opposed to immigration contending that the process invites scams.

For millions of immigrants and their supporters, however, the program is truly an island of niceness, as Catherine Ward-Seitz, the regional immigration coordinator for Bay Area Legal Aid in San Francisco, put it. With a soured economy encouraging hostility at worst and apathy at best toward illegal immigrants, the U visas are a bittersweet consolation prize.

In a compassionate twist on the idea that felons should be imprisoned, victims who can show that guns (or knives or fists) were used against them can be released from the fear of deportation.

While victims of several specified crimes are eligible, at least three-fourths of the applicants for U visas to date, like the Guatemalan baby sitter, who asked that her name not be used for fear of retaliation from her spouse, say they have suffered domestic violence, said Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Immigration lawyers said this was largely because of the prevalence of domestic violence in general.

Ending impunity in cases of domestic violence makes whole communities safer, proponents say.

“These are disclosure-driven crimes, meaning people have to come forth and report them; there’s no gunshot to bring it to our attention,” said Lt. Kevin Wiley, commander of the Oakland Police Department’s special victims unit, which certified 153 U visas last year.

“It’s all about building trust,” Lieutenant Wiley said, adding that police certification of the visas was a powerful tool in creating bonds among wary residents who have long been the silent victims of a range of crimes, like the robberies of illegal immigrants known on the streets as “amigo checkings.”

What is more, Lieutenant Wiley said, the police often discover that domestic violence offenders have multiple victims.

Congress approved an annual limit of 10,000 U visas. Yet the regulations that would put the law in force were not made final by the Department of Homeland Security until September 2007.

A few dozen U visas were approved in 2008. Then the pace increased. In the fiscal year ending last September, immigration officials approved 5,825. Another 2,244 were approved in October and November. More than 10,000 applications are pending.

Ms. Rhatigan said the long delay resulted mostly from the complexity of the new rules, although some immigration advocates say the change of administrations in Washington played a part.

Lawyers defending clients on the other side of the visa petitions worry that the incentives of a U visa are creating new wrongs as well as righting old ones.

Marin County’s deputy public defender, Tamara Chellam, argued that the U visas might create irresistible incentives for people to invent or exaggerate offenses. A recent client of Ms. Chellam is married to a woman who applied for a U visa while fighting her spouse for custody of their daughter. The woman testified that in early 2008, the defendant followed her to work at 5 a.m. and broke the window of her car. Although there were no other witnesses, the husband was convicted of stalking and assault. Ms. Chellam said she expected him to be deported on his release from prison.

A decade earlier, the woman had reported that her husband had abused her but subsequently said she wanted to drop charges, Ms. Chellam said. She applied for a U visa in 2007 on the basis of that incident, but court testimony revealed she had worried that it would not suffice because victims are required to cooperate continuously. Ms. Chellam said she suspected that the wife had tailored the 2008 incident to help support her subsequent successful application for a visa.

“The U visa offers a wonderful opportunity when used appropriately, but it can be lopsided and misused,” Ms. Chellam said. “If a person wants to get rid of a spouse fighting for custody, or a rival gang member, these visas are very convenient, while the people on the other side can lose everything: their children, their jobs, their liberty and their right to stay here.”

On the other hand, applicants for U visas tend to be unusually sympathetic, helping to explain why the law creating the visa gained nearly unanimous bipartisan support at the end of the Clinton administration.

“Undocumented immigrants are unbelievably vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and victimization because their fear of detection keeps them from reporting that victimization,” said Susan Bowyer, the managing lawyer for the Oakland office of the International Institute of the Bay Area. “It’s like they’re in a never-ending nightmare, where people kick them while they’re down because they are down.”

While struggling to break the bureaucratic logjam surrounding U visas, immigration lawyers and other advocates in this region, which is rich in both immigrants and immigrant advocates, formed a coalition. The group met regularly and communicated by frequently by e-mail to encourage one another, trade ideas and pressure immigration officials.

Keen pressure was brought in March 2007, when the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los Angeles — joined by three Bay Area advocacy groups — filed a federal lawsuit in San Francisco against Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Bay Area groups included Ms. Bowyer’s team in Oakland, the Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach group in San Francisco and Catholic Charities CYO, also based in San Francisco.

The Bay Area has since taken a prominent position nationwide in winning approvals for visas, with 16 local advocacy groups gaining 773 visas for their clients — more than 12 percent of the national total.

Ms. Bowyer’s office alone claimed 148 approvals. She calls herself a “U-vangelist” and churns out long e-mail messages and reports late into the night.

But not everyone applauds her success.

“The U visa goes beyond what’s necessary — or what should be necessary — to get people’s cooperation,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for Immigration Reform. “Why should we have to provide incentives for people not here legally when we do nothing extra for people who are here legally?”

For the baby sitter from Guatemala, the idea of getting a U visa in return for cooperation played no role in her decision to go to the police. She had done so in 2003, six years before she sought a visa. When she later learned she could apply for the visa, it was more, she suggested, like a gift from a universe that now seemed just a little more kind.

“Of course, I would have preferred another way to stay here,” she said. “But this was the way it happened, and it was worth it.”
220 2010-01-08 For decades, the Japanese have been clamoring for a real World Series that pits the best team in Major League Baseball against the best team in Japan.

That day may be closer than some people expect. At a meeting in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Bud Selig, the M.L.B. commissioner, told his Japanese counterpart, Ryozo Kato, that he was open to the idea of teams from both countries going head-to-head before he retires in 2012.

Kato, the commissioner of Nippon Professional Baseball, which includes two six-team leagues, has called for an international playoff before. He told Japanese reporters after returning to Japan that he was surprised and encouraged by Selig’s response.

Selig has championed the globalization of baseball for many years. But a United States-Japan showdown faces many hurdles, including significant questions about who would pay for it, where the games would be played and whether Major League Baseball’s collective bargaining agreement could be reworked to allow for it.

Teams of all-stars from the two countries have played exhibition games against each other dating to the days when Babe Ruth barnstormed in Japan. Major League Baseball teams including the Mets and the Yankees have played exhibition games against Japanese squads like the Tokyo Giants and the Seibu Lions before playing regulation games in Tokyo against American teams.

The Japanese have won the first two World Baseball Classics, and Japanese players like Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui have performed at the highest levels in the United States. But even that success has not satiated Japan’s hunger to play the American champions for an international title.
221 2010-01-08 Sheila C. Bair looks to be leading the regulatory race to the top. The agency she oversees, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, recently unveiled a handful of clever ideas to contain risky bank behavior and protect the nation’s deposit insurance fund. Rival watchdogs fighting for turf will find it difficult to ignore the F.D.I.C.’s latest tactics.

Generating the most buzz is a sensible plan to tie the amount that banks pay for deposit insurance to the risk in their compensation plans. Banks with plans that favor short-term gains would pay more than those that, for example, include multiyear clawbacks on bonuses. The agency will vote on the plan next week.

Of course, this comes as the Federal Reserve is also putting in place its own proposal to include executive pay in its overall assessment of bank stability. It’s not clear which agency will be more stringent. But a little competition between the two wouldn’t be the worst outcome after years in which banking regulators rivaled each other in their laxity.

Linking pay to insurance premiums follows a handful of other changes the F.D.I.C. is making. It recently revised the formula it uses to assess how much interest undercapitalized banks can pay to attract deposits. The net effect of the changes will be to reduce the rates banks can pay by an average of 12 basis points, the analytics firm Market Rates Insight estimates.

That is a clever way to limit moral hazard. Failing banks, more concerned with survival than profitability, often make last-ditch attempts to attract new deposits by offering ultrahigh rates on savings products wrapped by the F.D.I.C.’s insurance.

Similarly, the F.D.I.C. is pushing for a form of insurance from the buyers of failed bank assets. To mitigate some losses the fund incurs on assets in receivership, the F.D.I.C. is pushing for the buyers of the assets to make payments linked to the increase in their share prices after the announcement of a deal.
222 2010-01-08 Moreover, Lugano is the heart of Italian-speaking Switzerland, so Italian bank clients do not have to struggle with French, German or English.

“Swiss political stability, terrorism in Italy, led important Italian entrepreneurs to flee a fluctuating lira and a punishing fiscal system,” said Franco Citterio, 47, a former banker, now director of a local banking association.

What are now called “the troubles” here began when Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a proponent of low taxes and fiscal discipline, announced his intention to “dry out” Lugano as a haven for tax evaders.

He had closed-circuit cameras installed along the Italian-Swiss border near Lugano to register the license plate numbers of Italian cars crossing into Switzerland. The owners of those cars would then be subject to audits by the Italian tax police. In October the Italian police raided branches of Swiss banks in Italian cities, including some from Lugano, in search of evidence of tax evasion, angering the Swiss.

But Mr. Tremonti’s biggest gun was the announcement of a tax amnesty that allowed Italians to repatriate assets from foreign bank accounts without fear of criminal prosecution and made them pay only a 5 percent penalty on the total.

Mr. Tremonti has experience with amnesties. In 2001 and 2003, in an earlier Berlusconi cabinet, he enacted similar measures that brought $25 billion back to Italy. A further $19 billion was declared by Italian clients of Lugano banks, though it remained in Switzerland.

But that yield has been dwarfed by the rich harvest this time. Mr. Tremonti recently announced that $136 billion had been brought back to Italy, showering Rome with a $7 billion tax windfall. He announced that the amnesty would continue, at least until the end of April, though with steeper penalties.

The threat to Lugano’s financial health is considerable. Of the $390 billion in assets in its banks, Mr. Citterio said, about three-fourths are held by foreigners. Of that, Italians hold an estimated two-thirds. By some estimates, up to four-fifths of that Italian money may be undeclared.

Last April, Switzerland concluded a dozen taxation agreements with major countries, including the United States, but negotiations with Italy are frozen.

Fulvio Pelli, 58, leader of the Liberal-Radical Party, the largest in the canton of Ticino, where Lugano is located, blames Mr. Tremonti. “It’s not acceptable,” he said, accusing Italy’s leaders of a “vendetta, a missionary zeal.”

Others accuse them of hypocrisy. “When they were in business they brought their money to Switzerland,” said Stefano Fiala, 37, a managing director of a money management firm. “Now that they’re politicians, they go aggressively after Swiss banks.”

Riccardo Dorna, 56, who runs a company that cuts stone for building sites, said the fault lay in Lugano. “The good side was, we had a strong financial sector,” he said. “Now, however, that’s the sector that’s hurting.”

Fortunately for Lugano, the region has benefited from rapid growth in recent years in businesses outside finance, like computer technology and shipping. Italian fashion houses like Gucci and Versace now ship apparel and accessories worldwide from Ticino, relying on the Swiss over unpredictable Italian airports.

“Thanks to these structures, compared to other cantons, Ticino is not doing too badly,” said Luca Albertoni, 45, the director of the local Chamber of Commerce. Indeed, every day about 45,000 Italians, many of them well-trained technicians, engineers and money managers, cross the border to work in Ticino, returning to Italy in the evening.

Some here see them as bargaining chips in the border wars. In October, the newspaper of the conservative party, League of Ticino, urged the expulsion of 500 Italian day workers for every billion Swiss francs withdrawn from Lugano because of the amnesty.

Mr. Albertoni said the Swiss should stop blaming others for their problems. “Mr. Tremonti,” he said provocatively, “is doing a good job. It’s a Swiss problem, not an Italian problem. We lived too long with the illusion that we could forever take advantage of the Italian situation.”
223 2010-01-08 “The Well-Tempered Clavier” was once the preserve of specialists, among both performers and listeners, but these days one or both of Bach’s collections of preludes and fugues in every key can be heard in live performance several times a year. The readings come in every flavor: on harpsichord, clavichord or piano; in accounts steeped in musicological detail or in freewheeling interpretations; and in grandly scaled traversals in halls as large as Carnegie or more intimate performances in chamber spaces.

For this music, intimate is the way to go, and you can hardly get more intimate than Bargemusic, the 130-seat concert hall moored on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Niklas Sivelov, a Swedish pianist and composer who has made several appearances at the barge in recent years, played “The Well-Tempered Clavier,” Book 1, on Wednesday evening, rounding out a small Bach marathon that included Book 2 last Saturday and Sunday, and the “Brandenburg” Concertos on New Year’s Eve.

Mr. Sivelov approached Book 1 without an apparent agenda: unlike Richard Egarr, whose harpsichord performance at Weill Recital Hall in 2008 explored relatively recent theories about what “well-tempered” tuning meant to Bach, Mr. Sivelov played the work on the piano, in the standard modern tuning.

And unlike Daniel Barenboim, who seemed intent on giving each piece a distinct, personalized orchestration when he played the set at Carnegie Hall in 2007, Mr. Sivelov offered a unified view and varied his timbre and dynamics only subtly.

Mostly, he favored brisk tempos, bright timbres and a clean if sometimes weighty sound. You could question his speediness at times: in the opening C major Prelude, he played the arpeggiated figures so quickly that the lingering overtones made them sound almost like solid chords. Yet here and in several other unusually quick readings, he let the top notes in each arpeggio ring out clearly to create a graceful, floating melody. And particularly in the fugues, he maintained a remarkable transparency of texture.

At times — in the outgoing E major and G major preludes and fugues, for example — he leaned into the music almost like a jazz pianist, tapping his left foot quickly to a rhythm from within Bach’s dense contrapuntal texture. But though extroversion was clearly Mr. Sivelov’s preferred mode, he was sensitive to Bach’s darker moods as well: his calm, supple performance of the D sharp minor Fugue and the organlike sound he brought to the stormy, chromatic Prelude and Fugue in A minor were among the highlights of his performance.
224 2010-01-08 The justice ministry of Switzerland said Thursday that it may decide soon whether to grant a request by the United States to extradite Roman Polanski, Agence France-Presse reported. The ministry’s spokesman, Folco Galli, told Agence France-Presse: “We are preparing our decision. It could be January, it could also be in February. I am not going to be more precise.” Mr. Polanski, who fled the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl, was apprehended in Switzerland in September. He spent several months in a jail near Zurich before posting $4.5 million bail in December and is now under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad. On Wednesday a written request from Mr. Polanski to be sentenced in absentia was presented to a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge. The judge, Peter P. Espinoza, has scheduled a hearing on Jan. 22 to consider it.
225 2010-01-08 HONG KONG — No wonder the Chinese government is trying to extend its winter chill to the residential market. Average home prices in Shanghai leapt 68 percent last year, according to new research, while Beijing shot up 66 percent and Shenzhen, 51 percent.

Also, the number of transactions recorded during 2009 in these and other Chinese “first-tier” cities matched the combined total of activity in the previous three years.

“It is very dramatic,” said Xavier Wong, research head at Knight Frank’s Hong Kong office. “It has confirmed our view that the first-tier cities have been the leaders in the price recovery.”

Knight Frank, the London-based global property company, just released the data, the beginnings of its joint venture with Beijing Holdways Information & Technology, a Chinese real estate consultancy, to produce reliable information on the world’s largest market. The initial report examines 10 major cities but Knight Frank says it plans to analyze the 35 cities in its database and possibly expand to as many as 100 cities.

And, as usual when it comes to statistics in China, not everything is as it seems.

“Inter-city comparisons weren’t meaningful previously,” Mr. Wong said. “The data has always been available but nobody organized it in this kind of detail, in a systematic way.” Some cities, for instance, routinely include subsidized housing in their tallies. Other municipalities include transactions in their vast suburbs, where prices are much lower.
226 2010-01-08 SANA, Yemen — A senior official here said Thursday that the young Nigerian man accused of trying to bring down an airliner as it was approaching Detroit on Dec. 25 had met with operatives of Al Qaeda and probably with Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Internet preacher, in Yemen before setting out on his journey.

But the official, Rashad al-Alimi, the deputy prime minister for national security and defense, cited Yemeni investigations and said that the Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, had acquired the explosives used in the failed attack not in Yemen, which he left on Dec. 4, but in Nigeria. There he changed planes at the Lagos airport on Dec. 24, boarding a flight to Amsterdam and then another to Detroit.

Mr. Alimi’s remarks, made at a news conference in Sana, offered Yemen’s most definitive public reconstruction of Mr. Abdulmutallab’s movements before the attack. But the account differed on crucial points from those given by British, Ghanaian and Nigerian officials: where Mr. Abdulmutallab was recruited, where he obtained the explosives, even how long he spent in the Nigerian airport.

According to previous accounts, Mr. Abdulmutallab flew from Accra, Ghana, on Dec. 24, and had a layover at the airport in Lagos on his way to boarding the Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines flight in Amsterdam. American officials have said that Mr. Abdulmutallab told F.B.I. investigators that Al Qaeda in Yemen had trained him and furnished him with the sophisticated bomb he concealed in his underwear.

Mr. Alimi denied emphatically that Mr. Abdulmutallab left Yemen with the explosives, saying the suspect obtained them in Nigeria, though he offered no specific evidence for his assertion.

232 2010-01-09 None of this comes as news to people who have been prescribing or studying antidepressants over the past 20 years. Neither is it all that likely to change the practice of treating depression — at least as it’s carried out by responsible doctors.

After all, people who are depressed for the first time, or have been depressed for only a short time, or are upset after a personal setback, aren’t considered ideal candidates for immediate drug therapy. And, contrary to popular belief, there’s no evidence that most psychiatrists regularly prescribe pills straight off to people who can get better by reading about depression, exercising or doing nothing. What numbers do exist, said Peter Kramer, who has written extensively on antidepressant use in books like “Listening to Prozac,” indicate that relatively few people with minimal depression leave psychiatrists’ offices with a prescription.

That people have come to believe otherwise may be in part because most patients with depression are treated by general practitioners, not psychiatrists. Studies have shown that these primary care doctors don’t strenuously enough screen their patients for depression before prescribing drugs, or closely monitor their care afterward.

And here the truer story about mental health care in America begins to unfold. The trouble is not that the drugs don’t work; it’s that the care is not very good.

Inadequate treatment by nonspecialists is only a piece of the problem. In fact, most Americans with depression, rather than being overmedicated, are undertreated or not treated at all. This might have been big news this week, too, had anyone noticed another academic study, a survey of nearly 16,000 people published this month in The Archives of General Psychiatry, which looked more broadly at the picture of depression in America. The survey found that those who did get care were given psychotherapy more often than drugs. That finding might give heart to those who would prefer to see more alternatives to psychiatric drugs — if it weren’t for the fact that so much psychotherapy is so bad.

In 2008, a team of psychologists brought this point home in blunt terms in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest. “Despite the availability of highly effective interventions,” they wrote, “relatively few psychologists learn or practice these interventions.”

This is the big picture of mental health care in America: not perfectly healthy people popping pills for no reason, but people with real illnesses lacking access to care; facing barriers like ignorance, stigma and high prices; or finding care that is ineffective.

It is a societywide concern that a co-author of the new antidepressants study readily acknowledges. “What we reported on was a very small piece of a very large problem,” Robert J. DeRubeis, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. “Those kinds of things are not being sorted out in this country because there’s no system. Nobody’s asking these questions.”

With health care reform almost certainly on the horizon, perhaps now we can hope they will start asking.
233 2010-01-09 Sentencing Liu Xiaobo, a signer of Charter 08, to 11 more years in prison under the trumped-up charge of “inciting subversion of state power,” one often used to mete out unjustified imprisonment, is another black mark for China.

People everywhere, including many Chinese, deplore this further evidence of the Chinese government’s fear of its own people. Chinese leaders remain oblivious to the internationally recognized principle of responsible leadership chosen freely by a country’s people and continue to ignore the basic right to freedom of expression through open discussion.

Ding Zilin, the courageous leader of Tiananmen Mothers, calls Charter 08 — an appeal for human rights protections and democratic reform — “the embodiment of China’s conscience.”

President Obama should take a strong stand in pressing for Liu Xiaobo’s release.

The writer is the widow of Edgar Snow, author of “Red Star Over China.”
234 2010-01-09 It was a moment that seemingly called for a follow-up question.

On “Good Morning America” on ABC Friday, the former New York City mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, stated that “we had no domestic attacks under Bush; we’ve had one under Obama.”

The misstatement — which omitted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which occurred nearly eight months after President Bush took office — was roundly criticized Friday, even by some of ABC’s correspondents. “Even if you assume he meant post-9/11 this is hard to justify,” Rick Klein, the primary author of ABC’s online political memo The Note, wrote on Twitter.

But at the time, the interviewer, George Stephanopoulos, let Mr. Giuliani’s assertion go unquestioned. The segment ended a minute later with a joke about the day’s snowfall in New York City.

Amid an online outcry, Mr. Stephanopoulos, a veteran political anchor who became a co-host of the show last month, acknowledged later Friday that the lack of follow-up was a mistake.

“All of you who have pointed out that I should have pressed him on that misstatement in the moment are right. My mistake, my responsibility,” he wrote in a blog post.

He did not say whether he would address the misstatement in a future television program.

The comment was raised at a White House news briefing Friday, where the press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said “there were a number of things” in the interview “that didn’t quite seem to jibe with the better part of reality.”
235 2010-01-09 California, it turns out, has too many Chihuahuas. New York City does not have enough. So animal welfare officials in San Francisco and Manhattan arranged for what a Virgin America press release dubbed a “Chihuahua airlift” — 15 homeless dogs from the Bay Area were flown to Kennedy by the airline so they could be adopted by New Yorkers. It has been no small feat. The A.S.P.C.A. estimated that it would spend $100 to $2,000 per dog for spaying and neutering, shots, food, housing, veterinary care and other costs. At least one dog will undergo orthopedic surgery.

Virgin America donated roughly $12,000 in travel costs for the dogs and their human companions. None of the 15 Chihuahuas were at risk of being euthanized (no adoptable cats or dogs are put to death in San Francisco, only those with severe behavioral or health issues).

The Chihuahuas will be given behavioral as well as medical assessments, and a number of them will be available for public viewing and adoption on Wednesday at noon. “We expect them to take a little bit of time to adjust to the New York sights and sounds,” said Arthur Hazlewood, senior director of the Adoption Center.

Though this has long been a small-dog city (because it is a small-apartment city), the Chihuahua has never quite symbolized New York. “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,” the 2008 movie, has a certain ring to it that, say, “Brooklyn Chihuahua” lacks. Yet the breed has quietly earned a reputation as one of the most popular in the city.

About 101,000 dogs have licenses issued by the health department, but that’s a small percentage of the estimated 500,000 dogs in New York City. Among the licensed dogs, the Chihuahua is the fourth most popular breed, outranking the pit bull at No. 7, according to data from the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The most popular is the mutt, followed by the Yorkshire terrier and then the Shi Tzu. The least popular is the Tibetan mastiff.

On Thursday afternoon, the 15 California Chihuahuas were spread out among three condos and four offices. In Room N, one of the fourth-floor condos, six Chihuahuas — including a well-rested C. J., the passenger in 20E — scampered around their wire pens. Each had a silvery water bowl and a necessary layer of restroom-style paper towels on the floor. They clamored for attention when Gail Buchwald, the center’s senior vice president, made a surprise visit. She let some of them loose. Jeb grew somewhat agitated after he saw a large dog strut down the hall, snapping at his fellow Chihuahuas.

It was only their second day in the city, but they were quickly becoming New Yorkers, meaning they were becoming more feisty, more resilient, more pampered and more, well, complicated. They have their own phone number at the Adoption Center (212-876-7700, extension 3210, the group’s Operation Chihuahua hot line). And there is even romance in Room N: Honey and Hancock have been inseparable, and snuggled up to each other in a pen while Jeb barked.

“Look at the way he’s looking at her,” Ms. Buchwald said of Hancock, his eyes wide, his tail wagging. “This is love.”

The group hopes that Honey and Hancock will be adopted as a pair to keep them together.

One of the reasons for California’s large numbers of Chihuahuas is “the Hollywood effect,” said Rebecca Katz, acting director of San Francisco Animal Care and Control, which provided the 15 dogs and helped escort them on their flights. Chihuahuas have been the stars of movies, cartoons and fast-food commercials, and have become fashion accessories for celebrities, including Paris Hilton, who offered a $5,000 reward when her Chihuahua, Tinkerbell, was missing in 2004. Yet many California owners have given up their pets because they were ill-prepared to properly care for them, Ms. Katz said.

“Some of the Bay Area shelters are reporting that as much as 60 percent of their dogs are Chihuahuas or Chihuahua mixes,” she said.

At the Manhattan shelter, the opposite was true: The 15 Chihuahuas were the only Chihuahuas there. In the end, they and their kind were outnumbered by the shelter’s other occupants, the New Yorkers that C. J., Malibu and the rest will likely have the hardest time getting along with.
236 2010-01-09 Most discussion about full-body scanners has focused on privacy issues surrounding the nude images that would result. The American Civil Liberties Union has denounced the practice as a “virtual strip search.”

Some experts argue that the broad use of the scanners raises the same question that pertains to any other routine exposure to small doses of radiation: Do the benefits outweigh the risks?

“The guiding principle is not whether Mother Nature is going to kill you one day,” said Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear physicist. “It’s whether we can justify doing something to each other based on the benefit you’re going to get.”

Officials at the Transportation Security Administration say they have already tried out a handful of backscatter scanners. They could acquire 450 from the manufacturer, Rapiscan Systems, by the end of September. The agency has a contract under which it could buy 900 of the scanners. The machines have been used for years at prisons and other places where the authorities look for weapons, including at nuclear power plants.

In a 2002 report on the safety of backscatter scanners, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, which is highly influential in setting regulatory standards, said it “cannot exclude the possibility of a fatal cancer attributable to radiation in a very large population of people exposed to very low doses of radiation.”

One author of that report, David J. Brenner, a professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia and director of the university’s Center for Radiological Research, said that risk might be increased as the transportation agency moves from using the scanning machines as a second-round check after metal detectors and hand searches to using them as a first-line screening system.

“When we were looking at these a few years back, it was always going to be as a secondary screening tool,” he said. “In that scenario, I don’t think there’s too much concern.” But, he said, if millions or tens of millions of passengers a year were scanned with the backscatter X-ray, he said, the risk would be higher.

The health effect of small doses of radiation is not observed, but inferred from the visible effects of higher doses. Dr. Makhijani said that if a billion passengers were screened with the dose assumed by the radiation protection council, that would mean 10 more cancer deaths a year.

Those deaths would represent only a tiny increment over the existing cancer rate, he said, just as the extra dose was a tiny fraction of the natural background dose of radiation people get from everyday exposures, but he added that they should still be considered.

Edward Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the additional deaths would be indistinguishable from cancers resulting from other causes. But he said, “Just because they can’t be attributed in an epidemiology study to the additional radiation, it doesn’t mean they’re not there.”

Other experts, however, including David A. Schauer, the radiation council’s executive director, disputed the idea that collective doses of radiation increased risks significantly.

Doses divided into tiny portions among millions of people are not the same as those concentrated on a few people, Dr. Schauer said.

“I personally don’t buy it,” he said. “From a public health point of view, it’s a bit of a stretch.”

The radiation council sets standards for doses to radiation workers and to the general public, but does not set a standard for a collective dose.

Robert Barish, a radiation consultant in New York and the author of a 1996 book, “The Invisible Passenger,” said the doses delivered by the scanners were tiny by any standard, and passengers would get the same dose in a few minutes in a high-altitude jet, where most of the earth’s atmosphere is not available to shield people from cosmic rays.

A spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration, Kristin Lee, said that even for pregnant women, children and people whose genetic makeup made them more susceptible to X-ray damage, “It would take more than 1,000 screenings per individual per year” to exceed radiation standards.

According to a blog published by the Transportation Security Administration, the radiation dose from the scanner is about the same amount as an average American receives from natural background sources in four minutes on the ground.

But Dr. Lyman, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, noted that at one point the blog had listed a much higher dose for the scanners. When the discrepancy was pointed out, the agency corrected the blog to the lower figure.

Backscatter scanners work by shooting a beam of X-rays at a subject. But rather than making an image from what passes through the body, as a doctor’s diagnostic X-ray machine does, backscatter machines measure what bounces back, producing an image of the passenger without clothing. The X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, that is, radiation powerful enough to strip molecules in the body of their electrons, creating charged particles that cause cell damage and are thought to be the mechanism through which radiation causes cancer.
237 2010-01-09 Investigators provided new details about the shooting that left three people dead and five injured at an ABB Inc. transformer repair plant in St. Louis on Thursday, saying that the gunman, Timothy Hendron, 51, carried four guns and fired more than 100 rounds. Mr. Hendron, an employee who was suing the company, fatally shot himself in the head. Investigators said another handgun was recovered outside the plant. Also killed were Carlton J. Carter, 57; Terry Mabry, 55; and Cory Wilson, 27. Investigators said Mr. Hendron’s motive remained unclear.
238 2010-01-09 His company’s story symbolizes the path that other Sri Lankan businesses and industries have had to follow to compete with the likes of China and India, which have lower costs of production and the advantage of size. To attract business, Sri Lankan companies have become specialists and producers of affordable yet exclusive products. In apparel, for instance, producers here have established themselves as a go-to source for lingerie and sportswear so they do not have to compete on cheaper clothes directly with low-cost mass producers like Bangladesh and China.

“To compete with the Chinese juggernaut in particular, the Sri Lankan strategy has been to go into niches like lingerie for Victoria’s Secret,” said Razeen Sally, an expert on the Sri Lankan economy who is co-director of the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels.

In tea, Sri Lanka was the world’s largest exporter as recently as 2004, but it lost significant market share as governments and companies in Kenya and China made a big push to produce low-cost tea, and as green tea became more popular. Today, Sri Lanka exports about $1.3 billion in tea.

Mr. Fernando spent much of his career selling tea to big companies like Lipton and Tetley. But in the 1970s, he noticed that buyers in the United States, Europe and Australia had started to buy less Sri Lankan tea, blending it with cheaper teas from other countries. Those companies’ profits jumped, but growers, producers and traders in Sri Lanka were devastated.

“Unless I got into branding and marketing,” he said, “I would have been out of the business in two or three years.”

Dilmah, named after his sons Dilhan and Malik, who now help run the company, positioned itself as a seller of pure Sri Lankan, or Ceylon, tea that was not blended with other teas.

But most foreign supermarket operators and customers had never heard of Dilmah and it was hard to persuade them to take a chance on the upstart, said Jaliya Wickramasuriya, Sri Lanka’s ambassador to the United States and a former Dilmah executive. “It was very difficult to even get an appointment with the big chains,” he said.

Mr. Fernando’s break came in the mid-1980s when an Australian supermarket chain, Coles, gave him an order for tea that carried the store’s brand. Dilmah has since expanded across much of the globe, including recently the United States. The research firm Datamonitor estimates it is the sixth-largest tea brand in the world now. In the six months ended in September, Ceylon Tea Services, Dilmah’s parent company, earned $5.2 million on $19.7 million in revenue. That was up from profits of $1.3 million, on $18.6 million in revenue the year before, when the company’s earnings were hurt by a fall in the value of the Australian dollar.

Dilmah has also expanded into tourism, by turning four old tea plantation bungalows in central Sri Lanka into five-star guest houses known as Ceylon Tea Trails. The company plans to add two more bungalows and build 10 timeshare villas nearby.

The company has opened “tea bars” where it offers tastings and classes about how to make, drink and appreciate tea, much as wineries do. These efforts are aimed at showing consumers that its tea is worth the extra cost. Dilmah’s white tea, for instance, cost $11 for a box of 10 bags while a box of Twinings costs about $3. (White tea costs more than black or green tea because it is made from a smaller part of the plant and has more antioxidants.)

The Sri Lankan tea industry has been slow to change in some important ways. Many of its tea bushes, for instance, have low yields because they are decades past their prime and need to be replanted, which is expensive, said Hasitha de Alwis, director of promotion for the Sri Lanka Tea Board.

The country has also shunned automation to preserve the quality of its tea. While most producers in Kenya and India make black tea using a speedy manufacturing process known as cut, turn and curl, Sri Lanka favors a traditional approach that takes longer to produce more varieties.

Most tea here is also hand-plucked by small teams of Tamil women who are descendants of Indians who were brought to the island 150 years ago by the British. After years of struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, Sri Lankan estate workers are now better paid than laborers in India and elsewhere, though many often still live in small, rundown houses.

A recent labor agreement increased wages by about 40 percent; most workers earn $3.50 to $5 a day. That increase and an estimated 15 percent drop in production because of inadequate rainfall have helped drive up prices at Colombo’s tea auctions by 100 percent in the last 12 months.

Plantation companies that manage estates and a foundation funded by Mr. Fernando say they have spent millions to improve the quality of education, housing and health for plantation workers.

Still, industry and labor officials expect a severe labor shortage in the coming years because many children of plantation workers are not interested in working in tea fields even at the increased wages.

On a recent December afternoon, K. Tilgowthey and about 15 other women were plucking tea leaves from a hillside in central Sri Lanka as the rain came down. They worked quickly and quietly, the only sounds coming from the snapping of tea leaves and the rustle of the plastic bags that covered their heads and torsos. Many of the women wore no shoes; some wore flip-flops.

Mrs. Tilgowthey, 31, said she started working on the Holyrood Estate, which is partly owned by Dilmah, 10 years ago when she married a man who worked and lived here. The couple have two daughters and a son. Asked whether she would like them to work with her on the plantation, she was quick to say no.

“It’s hard work,” she said. “So, I hope my children get educated.”
239 2010-01-09 FOR the first time in at least half a century, American companies announced more dividend cuts than increases in 2009.

In a normal year, companies announce 10 to 20 times more favorable than unfavorable dividend changes, but the last two years have been anything but normal. The financial crisis forced many financial companies to cut or suspend payments, and the credit crisis and recession led many other companies to cut back wherever they could.

But by the end of the year, there were indications that the recession was over and the number of negative dividend decisions began to decline, according to statistics compiled by Standard & Poor’s.

“The fourth quarter was in no way a good period for dividends, but compared to recent history it marks a significant improvement, and when added to the stabilization in increases, supports our belief that the worst is over for dividends,” said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at S.& P.

“Standard & Poor’s believes that the dividend recovery will be slow, and that it will take until 2012 to 2013 to return to where we were in 2007 and 2008,” he added.
240 2010-01-09 OTTAWA — Canada’s five largest banks, long criticized by some for their power over the country’s economy, are now poised to become Canada’s largest newspaper publisher.

As expected, CanWest Global Communications, the media company based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, sought bankruptcy protection for its national newspaper chain on Friday. The company owns the dominant daily newspapers in Vancouver, the Alberta cities of Edmonton and Calgary, Ottawa and Montreal as well as the Toronto-based National Post.

CanWest, a broadcaster that became heavily indebted by its move into publishing as well as a deal to acquire several of Canada’s leading cable channels, put many of its broadcasting assets under court protection in October.

While the Asper family, which founded and controlled CanWest, hopes to maintain control of its television business, Friday’s filing ends its role as the country’s leading publisher.

Along with the announcement of the court protection filing, CanWest said that the newspaper unit’s senior lenders have agreed to acquire the operation in a debt for equity swap. The lenders are a group that is led by the Bank of Nova Scotia and includes four of its rival banks.
241 2010-01-09 In his first news conference since taking office, Mr. Kan vowed Thursday to impose his will on the ministry.

“In ways both good and bad, the Finance Ministry has been a symbolic presence in Kasumigaseki,” said Mr. Kan, 63, referring to the district in Tokyo where the central ministries’ head offices are located. “It will now become a model of how to change Kasumigaseki.”

In his previous role as deputy prime minister, Mr. Kan was one of two top officials directing the Hatoyama government’s still-early efforts to make the bureaucracy more answerable to elected politicians, and to drag policy making out of smoky back rooms. But Mr. Hatoyama has come under criticism that he has failed to rein in the powerful Finance Ministry, which analysts said still played a leading role in drawing up the new government’s revised budget for 2010.

One of the founding members of Mr. Hatoyama’s Democratic Party, Mr. Kan first gained fame as a battler of bureaucracy during his brief stint as health minister in the mid-1990s, when he exposed the Health Ministry’s failure to prevent the spread of H.I.V.-tainted blood used in transfusions.

In challenging the Finance Ministry, Mr. Kan faces an uphill fight that could determine the success of the fledgling government’s efforts to bring change, said Professor Iwai and other analysts. The ministry has successfully resisted past efforts to curtail its budget-making authority, though in the late 1990s it did lose its powers to regulate the financial industry and its control over the nation’s central bank, the Bank of Japan.

“This won’t be ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,’ ” Mr. Iwai said. “He cannot just demonize the ministry. He has to find a way to win the bureaucrats over to his side and use them effectively.”

The new government’s success in fulfilling its promises to make Japan more democratically accountable could largely rest on Mr. Kan’s ability to control the Finance Ministry, which is widely seen here as one of the last bastions of Japan’s crumbling postwar order. Mr. Hatoyama badly needs a political victory as he faces mounting criticism over political financing scandals and a spat with the United States, Japan’s traditional protector, over an air base on Okinawa.

Mr. Kan replaced Hirohisa Fujii, 77, who stepped down for health reasons. Though respected in the Democratic Party, Mr. Fujii was facing increasing criticism in the Japanese news media for allowing ministry bureaucrats to control the 2010 budget, undermining the new government’s efforts to put politicians in charge.

On Thursday, Mr. Kan vowed to be different from previous finance ministers, who tended to defend the ministry’s interests and to advocate policies fed to them by ministry bureaucrats. During his inaugural news conference, he spent much less time speaking about financial policy than speaking about how he would strengthen Japanese democracy by bringing the ministry to heel.

“The minister is not a representative of the ministry,” Mr. Kan told reporters. “He is a representative of the people.”

As if to underscore his lack of experience in financial policy, he briefly stirred up currency markets on Thursday by saying at the news conference that the yen should be weaker, a comment taken by traders as meaning the government may intervene to drive down the currency’s value. He later said he was misunderstood, and did not mean to imply that the government would weaken the yen.

Mr. Kan left little room for misunderstanding in his criticism of ministry bureaucrats. He threatened to replace uncooperative ministry officials. He also vowed to increase public oversight of so-called special accounts, vast pools of money from pension funds and elsewhere that his and other ministries have controlled with little disclosure.

Lastly, he promised to bring similar public exposure to the thousands of public corporations that are controlled by ministries, and that critics say are used to provide comfortable retirement jobs for former bureaucrats.

Mr. Kan said the ministry’s role as budget compiler gave it a view of the inner workings of other ministries as well. He vowed to make this information public in order to aid the government’s efforts to exert more control over the entire national bureaucracy.

“The Finance Ministry has all sorts of information, and is in a position to see inside of the pocketbooks” of other ministries, he said. “I will make that information public.”

252 2010-01-10 The notion emerged from his effort to grapple with a problem of induction: Given a long sequence of symbols describing real-world events, how can you extrapolate the sequence? The idea gave rise to a new approach to probability theory.

Mr. Solomonoff went on to pioneer the application of probability theory to solving artificial intelligence problems. But in the 1960s and 1970s he was ahead of his time, and the approach initially had little impact on the field. More recently, probability theory has caught on among artificial intelligence researchers and is now the dominant approach.

“Ray did early work on the theoretical foundations of learning systems, focused on understanding how to generate and assign probabilities to sequences of symbols, which could be mapped to the challenge of predicting what comes next, given what you’ve seen so far,” said Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft computer scientist and a former president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

“Beyond his core technical work,” Mr. Horvitz, added, Mr. Solomonoff was a “passionate proponent of the probabilistic approach to A.I., on the promise of building intelligent computing systems that could learn and reason under uncertainty.”

His work in the early 1960s predated the work of the Russian mathematician Andrei Kolmogorov, who also did pioneering research in information theory and later acknowledged Mr. Solomonoff’s earlier contributions.

Mr. Solomonoff later turned his attention to the consequences of artificial intelligence. In 1985 he wrote a paper that speculated on the cost and the time it would take to develop a machine with many times the intelligence of a group of humans. He called this the “infinity point.”

The idea predated the prediction of the computer scientist Vernor Vinge, who in 1993 speculated on a similar evolution in machine intelligence, which he called “the singularity.”

Born in Cleveland on July 25, 1926, Mr. Solomonoff was the son of immigrants from Russia, Julius and Sarah Solomonoff. He studied physics at the University of Chicago and graduated with a master’s degree in 1951.

Fiercely independent, he would remain self-employed for much of his life, taking a variety of visiting scholar positions. In 2001 he was a visiting professor at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Lugano, Switzerland; more recently he was a visiting professor at the Computer Learning Research Center at Royal Holloway, University of London.

He is survived by his wife, Grace, who said the cause of death was a ruptured brain aneurysm. He lived in Cambridge, Mass., and also had a home in New Ipswich, N.H., which he built himself, heating it with two rows of light bulbs in the ceiling, a feat made possible by thick insulation and inserts to cover the windows.
253 2010-01-10 Founded in 1984 by the husband-and-wife team of Rudy VanderLans and Zuzana Licko, Emigre was influential on the graphic design scene in the ’80s and ’90s. This was partly because of the company’s magazine, also called Emigre. First a quarterly and later a seminannual, it featured innovative typefaces and posters; eye-catching photography; offbeat profiles of writers and artists; and wide-ranging critical essays on subjects like the Bauhaus movement and the legibility of fonts. Although the magazine no longer exists, Emigre still operates as a font foundry; its library houses more than 300 typefaces.

From 1984 to 2005, Emigre magazine achieved cult status. With their unconventional and striking use of fonts, publications like Wired and McSweeney’s, both based in San Francisco, owe it a debt. In 2006 the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired the entire Emigre magazine canon for its permanent design collection, and put the magazines on display for a year.

“For me, like many others galvanized by graphic design during Emigre’s heyday, the magazine was the most consistently interesting design publication produced anywhere by anyone,” the design journalist Rick Poynor wrote in 2005.

Emigre chronicled a revolution in typography that went hand in hand with the birth of the personal computer, which brought new methods for creating type. (It’s perhaps no accident that Emigre and the Macintosh computer made their debuts in the same year.) The transformation also ran in tandem with the rise of postmodern theories then popular in art schools concerning the aesthetics of utilitarian design.

Such ideas helped to free font design from the constraints of functionality. Possibly for the first time since the elaborate but often illegible opening capital letters of medieval illuminated manuscripts, font designers didn’t have to worry about readability and reproducibility.

Going beyond the no-nonsense look of archetypal typeface families like Times and Helvetica, designers in Emigre’s orbit, like John Hersey, Joachim Müller-Lancé and Ms. Licko, saw font design as a form of creative expression. With its thick-contoured, cartoonish forms, Mr. Hersey’s Blockhead typeface won’t be used for street signs anytime soon, but the fonts are eye-catching. The same could be said of Ms. Licko’s aggressive and angular Oblong typeface.

For all the theoretical debate and creative output inspired by Emigre, the font-as-art movement seems to be over. The commercial interests in the fast-paced digital age have reduced typeface design to cookie-cutter templates and formulas. Unbridled innovation has largely been supplanted by nostalgic exhibitions and commemorative books.

Emigre magazine’s demise may be symptomatic of the fact that it was primarily a showcase for the company’s fonts. Its journalistic endeavors often supported the founders’ business goals, as is evidenced by its numerous articles denouncing designer-unfriendly typeface copyright laws. But Griff Williams, owner and director of Gallery 16, wrote in an e-mail message: “For me, the lesson learned from Emigre is that business and art can coexist. The typeface business was a guise to deliver content in profoundly interesting ways. Not the other way around.”

Mr. VanderLans was grappling with the tension between art and commerce while publishing his magazine. “The entrepreneurial element, which is crucial to the existence of any subculture, avant-garde or underground work, is largely overlooked when assessing the work, because to most people, whenever the commercial aspects become prominent, it somehow taints the work and renders it less pure or authentic,” he wrote in Emigre in 1995. “Yet it’s difficult to imagine how any movement can operate without a concentrated effort to make money.”
254 2010-01-10 “When job creation slows, there’s an increase in the number of people who pursue a graduate degree,” Mr. Payne said.

Officials at many law schools reported substantial increases in applications over last year. Washington University in St. Louis has had a 19 percent year-to-date increase in applications to its college of law. At the University of San Francisco School of Law, applications are up 35 percent over last year, and at the University of Iowa’s College of Law, applications are up 39 percent.

Some increases are more explicable than others. Applications to the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University have risen 54 percent this year, which may be related to its rise in the U.S. News & World Report rankings to 23 in 2009, from 36 the year before.

But at Cornell University’s Law School, whose ranking has remained relatively stable, applications are up 44 percent, and no one is quite sure of the reason for such a large increase.

Richard Geiger, dean of admissions, said: “I’m a little thrown off by the fact that our increase is much bigger than expected. There’s nothing big we’re doing to explain that kind of increase.”

Prebble Q. Ramswell, 37, is among those choosing to return to school after being unable to find work.

A mother with two bachelor’s degrees, one in political science and the other in psychology and sociology, Ms. Ramswell has nearly 10 years of work experience, including six years as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency.

Ms. Ramswell lost her job with the C.I.A. when her contract ended last spring. She and her husband, who had also worked for the C.I.A., were both unemployed.

“We were having such a difficult time finding work,” she said. After months of searching, her husband found work in Florida, and the couple and their 4-year-old daughter moved there from Northern Virginia.

“I still had no luck finding anything, so I said to myself, ‘What is it in my life that I have wanted to do, that could make something good of a situation that has turned horribly wrong?’ ”

Ms. Ramswell is now applying for a master’s degree in liberal arts, looking to leverage her background in social science and, ultimately, to become a psychotherapist.

“I’ve realized that it will make me more marketable and open more doors,” she said.

Stephanie E. Neal, 24, also said she was hoping to increase her appeal to employers by returning to school. She graduated from college with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and sociology in 2008 and has since completed a paralegal certificate and a victim’s assistance certificate. But she has been unemployed since May and is now preparing to take the G.R.E. She lives with her parents in Southern California and said “desperation” has pushed her back toward academia.

“With every job going to someone who has more experience and who is willing to take a pay cut to have a job, I’m left with what amounts to slim pickings,” she said. “With no income, I’ve turned to the idea of higher education.”

Collins Byrd, dean of admissions at the University of Iowa’s College of Law, said he had seen many applicants like Ms. Neal.

“I think people spent the past year in a bit of shell shock,” Mr. Byrd said. “I don’t think people applied at as high a rate because they just didn’t know what to do. They sat there and did nothing.

“Now they’re seeing what they can do, seeing if they can take out loans or mortgages on housing. I think people are coming to grips with reality.”
255 2010-01-10 In an interview on Saturday, Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, of New Jersey, said he was hoping that the United States attorney’s office would consider bringing federal charges because the penalty Mr. Jiang is facing, “is hardly noteworthy and would not discourage people who want to break through the perimeter.”

The senator said the trouble the security breach caused far outweighed the punishment: 1,600 people stuck in the airport for six hours; flights delayed and an “incalculable” loss of money. And then for five days after the incident, New Jersey law enforcement officials searched exhaustively for the man caught on a grainy surveillance video, one which Sen. Lautenberg had released on Thursday.

The video showed that Mr. Jiang was able to step past security last Sunday when a guard, identified by a law enforcement official as Ruben Hernandez, left his post. The guard has been on administrative leave since Tuesday, and he faces disciplinary action, according to the Transportation Security Administration.

Without Mr. Hernandez watching, Mr. Jiang was able to slip into an area of people who had already cleared security and embraced a woman in a puffy coat and kissed her. When security officials were alerted that someone had breached a secure area, they took steps to lock down the terminal.

Ning Huang, 33, a former Rutgers graduate student and a friend of Mr. Jiang’s identified the woman as Mr. Jiang’s girlfriend. Mr. Huang did not provide the woman’s name, but said she is a former Rutgers student who has dated Mr. Jiang for about a year and now lives in Los Angeles.

“He loves her very much,” Mr. Huang said on Saturday, outside the two-story house Mr. Jiang shares with five roommates. Mr. Huang added that his friend “just wanted to say goodbye to his girlfriend, so it was a very emotional moment. I don’t think he realized what he’s doing.”

Andy Riu, a friend of Mr. Jiang, also came to the Piscataway house after word spread on a soccer league’s online message board that Mr. Jiang would miss a scheduled 2 p.m. pickup game because he had been arrested.

“I think this man is very romantic,” Mr. Riu said.

Mr. Jiang, who comes from the Jiangxi province of China, said Mr. Huang, is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, according to the Rutgers University Web site. He intended to find a job in Los Angeles after graduation so he could be with his girlfriend, Mr. Huang said.

“I just hope this doesn’t affect his future career path.”

Mr. Jiang has not spoken publicly since his arrest. He was held in a building at the airport until about midnight Friday, when he was released on his own recognizance.

No date for his arraignment has been set yet, Esmeralda Cameron, a spokeswoman for the Newark Municipal Court said on Saturday.
256 2010-01-10 “The feeling is one of revolt,” said John Grubb, the campaign director for Repair California, a coalition behind a pair of initiatives to call a constitutional convention. “And come January, they will start negotiating the budget again, and there will be more fear and loathing. The feeling here is that California state government is broken, and we need not a little fix, but a big fix.”

Most of the initiatives seek a spot on the November ballot, when voters will choose a new governor and other statewide officials. And while many of the measures will fail to get enough signatures to make it to Election Day, the sheer number of change-centered ideas reflects California voters’ frustration.

In 2009, lawmakers struggled to close billions of dollars’ worth of budget gaps. The net result was service reductions — from longer lines at the Department of Motor Vehicles to the loss of dental benefits for Medicaid recipients — as well as widespread furloughs for state workers and the rare use of i.o.u.’s issued to vendors and residents who were owed tax refunds.

But California is still projected to be $20 billion in the red over the next 18 months, and some state services are already showing the scars from their cuts.

The public university system, once the crown jewel of California, is struggling with layoffs, tuition increases and outright student and faculty revolts. In the public secondary schools, classroom sizes have swelled and program cuts are rampant.

And everything costs more: sales taxes went up last year, as did many user fees.

On Friday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger released his latest executive budget, with pay reductions for state workers and more draconian service cuts.

California voters are distinctly unimpressed with the roles played in the crisis by the governor and legislators. Many lawmakers cater to the fringe elements of their respective political parties and are beholden to special interests that finance their campaigns. A paltry 13 percent of registered voters approve of the job the Legislature does, according to a poll by the Public Policy Institute of California.

And so the efforts to take matters into their own hands.

“It is a very California moment,” said Robert Hertzberg, co-chairman of California Forward, a group of business, political and academic leaders that seeks to change the state’s budget processes. “It is almost like there are a bunch of weapons on the battlefield, and the bullets will be the funding of these initiatives.”

To get an initiative on the ballot, a person or group pays a $200 fee, gets approval of the text from the state attorney general’s office, and then has 150 days to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures, which must be rigorously verified against voter registration records.

Throughout the decades, initiatives have followed the changing concerns of voters. In the 1930s, for instance, many dealt with liquor regulations, and in the 1970s and early ’80s, taxation was a principal concern. The most famous initiative of that era was Proposition 13, which put a cap on property taxes. In the past 20 years, criminal justice and civil rights issues have often been on the ballot.

“Government reform has been a repeated theme over time,” said Nicole Winger, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state’s office, which manages the initiative process. “Now those measures are on the rise again.”

The initiatives concerning the state budget are most in the spotlight, particularly the one that calls for a convention to rewrite the state’s constitution. Delegates to such a convention would quite likely change the law requiring a two-thirds vote in the Legislature to pass a budget, and they could impose limitations on the initiative process and undo earlier initiatives that require spending for certain programs.

A constitutional convention could also alter the balance of power between state and local governments by giving cities greater control over their portion of the state budget. Many critics of the current system deplore Sacramento’s centralized spending power and policy making for issues like education and local public safety.

Other ballot efforts would put stringent spending limits on the government, require a rainy-day fund and end $2 billion in corporate tax breaks.

Much of the anger in the ballot ideas is aimed straight at the Legislature. There are proposals to cut the pay of lawmakers in half and to prohibit them from voting on legislation that would have a financial impact on their contributors. (One that would force them to get drug tests recently failed to pass muster.)

Gabriella Holt, president of Citizens for California Reform, an advocacy group behind proposals to cut the pay of the Legislature and shorten its term, said, “We decided we should put the question to voters.”

“I think people are very, very angry and very, very frustrated,” Ms. Holt added, “and they want to send a message that they want to take back their government.”

Placing the Legislature in the ballot cross hairs may be of questionable effectiveness. But last spring, the only one of six ballot measures to succeed was one that prevented lawmakers and other high-ranking officials from getting raises in times of fiscal distress.

One initiative would even redraw the boundaries of Congressional districts, in order to make those races more competitive.

“There is a great deal of voter unhappiness with the dysfunction of their Legislature generally,” said the plan’s proponent, Charles T. Munger, who donated more than $1 million toward a successful 2008 initiative to redraw state legislative districts, “and some of that is fueling the general voter’s desire to see reform of the political process.”

He added: “The gerrymandering of districts is a national problem. But this is my state, and I am trying to fix it here.”

Whatever the outcome of these initiatives, the end of the year is almost certain to bring change to California, whether it is modest adjustments to the way the state passes its budget or a full-scale constitutional convention.

“Lots of people are unhappy, but for so many different and conflicting reasons that it is hard to envision where we will end up,” said Bruce E. Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. “It could be a chaotic jumble.”
257 2010-01-10 Several others lost money by deviating from what they truly understood in search of quick gains.

After describing the mistakes, Mr. Weiss offers rules of thumb so that we nonbillionaire investors can avoid similar errors. For example, he says, don’t assume that price declines indicate opportunity.

In the book, the background on the people who made the mistakes runs too long. And because many of them would not talk to him, Mr. Weiss often must speculate on their motivations.

Still, the book is an intriguing reminder of what not to do when investing your money.

Jane Bryant Quinn, on the other hand, is all about the “what to do’s.” In her third iteration of “Making the Most of Your Money Now” (Simon & Schuster, $35), she has rewritten sections to deal with the recent stock and housing market meltdowns.

Still, the book, which has grown to 1,242 pages, remains at its heart the “Joy of Cooking” of personal finance. It provides the basics in just about any area you can think of — from what you should consider about money when you are in your 20s, to what to do with your investments once you have retired — and presents simple, straightforward recipes outlining the fundamentals of how to accomplish your goals.

You can question some of Ms. Quinn’s decisions on how to allocate space: 35 pages on basic banking and 54 on credit cards, but just 6 pages on buying a co-op or condo? And if you are serious about a topic, like creating a will or trust, you will need more detail than you will find here.

But the book gives you a place to start. The tone is colloquial and occasionally witty. In talking about how people typical save and spend over their lifetime, she writes that if you are between the ages of 46 and 55, you know where your money goes: “to good old State U. At the same time, you get the creepy feeling you won’t be around forever. You thrash around. You buy books on financial planning. You have an affair. When all else fails, you start to save.”

She explains things simply — and that is always good.

And, speaking of simple, it doesn’t get any simpler than this: If you spend less, you can save more. That’s the thrust of “The Coupon Mom’s Guide to Cutting Your Grocery Bills in Half,” by Stephanie Nelson (Avery, $15).

Ms. Nelson, whose Web site, couponmom.com, boasts that it has two million members, says she believes in what she describes as “strategic shopping,” an approach that will probably require you to spend more time thinking about your groceries than you do now.

To shop strategically, you must know some basics:

PRICES If you aren’t familiar with what you typically pay for a bottle of ketchup or a pound of chicken, you can’t recognize a deal.

YOUR STORE’S POLICY Each retailer, of course, has its own kinds of discount programs.

COUPONS They’re like “cash or confetti,” the author says. “Use them wisely, and they’re essentially legal currency,” she notes. Lose them or forget about them until they expire, “and they’re just slips of paper.”

By following Ms. Nelson’s advice, you may indeed cut your grocery bills sharply. She suggests comparing store prices, scouring multiple sources — including countless Web sites — for coupons and capitalizing on in-store specials.

But even the less than hard core can benefit simply by using coupons and planning menus around what is on sale, as opposed to looking for deals on something they have already planned to cook.

Ms. Nelson even includes some low-cost recipes. The lasagna, which calls for minced onions and cooking sherry, sounds particularly tasty.

We are 10 days into the new year. You may have started to slip on your diet — the aforementioned lasagna probably won’t help — and you may have decided to skip a day (or two) at the gym, but there is still time to improve your finances.
258 2010-01-10 “Clearly, he added, “that can be a quick way to lose money.”

Seth J. Masters, who oversees asset allocation for AllianceBernstein, said that some of today’s views on the importance of bonds for personal investing stem from the 1950s, when life expectancies were shorter.

The fact that people are living longer is “a wonderful thing,” he said, “but it is a real challenge because you are looking at 24 to 30 years of retirement.”

“If you have the bulk of your savings in bonds with today’s interest rates,” he added, “you have a smoother path to a dismal result.”

Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm, finds it more appropriate to be in stocks than bonds because the yields are limited. “This is the first time I have been so opposed to bonds because the levels of returns are so microscopic,” he said.

The problem, though, is that by holding stocks rather than bonds, investors may be raising the level of risk in their portfolio. But even those who like bonds are being more cautious.

“Stop looking for income and look for cash flow,” said Harold Evensky, a partner at Evensky & Katz Wealth Management in Coral Gables, Fla. He says he thinks that people who need money to live on each year should consider the total return of the portfolio, including capital gains, and not focus solely on dividends and interest.

“People need cash flow that will grow with inflation,” he said. “Bond interest rates do not, and dividends may or may not.”

As for the bond component of the portfolio, “we are getting more defensive and keeping shorter-duration funds,” he said. “We are also more concerned about quality: we used to say we wanted A-rated bonds. Now we generally want double-A-rated bonds or better.”

For taxable accounts, Mr. Evensky likes Vanguard Short Term Tax Exempt and T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Intermediate, among others. For tax-free accounts, he uses the BlackRock Low Duration fund and the Pimco Total Return fund.

Mr. Yardeni believes in a mix of high-quality bonds and dividend-yielding stocks. And while he thinks that municipals are relatively safe, he strongly favors revenue bonds, like those issued for roads or bridges that charge tolls, so that there is a dedicated stream of income to make interest payments.

General obligation bonds are tied to the creditworthiness of a municipal government and have typically been viewed as safe. But he worries about the fiscal soundness of some municipalities in this recession.

Alexander Anderson Jr., a money manager at Envision Capital Management, which buys individual bonds for its clients, looks for bonds with final maturities of six years or less and ratings in the municipal universe of A+ or better and triple B or better for corporate bonds.

“You have to be cautious about locking up money in longer-term bonds,” he said. “Rising interest rates will diminish the value of those bonds.”

Some financial advisers are willing to take a bit more risk with municipal bonds.

JASON T. THOMAS, chief investment officer at Aspiriant, a wealth management firm in Los Angeles, says he likes the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund, which holds municipal bonds with an average rating of triple B.

In Mr. Thomas’s view, people are too worried about state and local government finances.

“When they get scared, they run and buy short-term, high-quality bonds” when they could be getting higher returns. He says he believes that Nuveen has the best municipal bond credit analysis team, and that the ability to evaluate risk is key.

Ann Rutledge, a principal at R & R Consulting in New York, cautions people to talk to their advisers about the bond issues they are buying and, if possible, to do their own research. She said ratings “may be stale and not reflect updated credit information.”

For example, she said, be sure to try to understand how a bond issuer makes money.

“If a lot of that information is in the footnotes, that is a bad sign,” Ms. Rutledge said.

Much more information is now available on debt issues than in the past, she pointed out. Last summer, EMMA: Electronic Municipal Mark Access began providing free, up-to-date financial filings on almost all of the 1.2 million debt issues outstanding, as well as details on trades in specific bonds going back five years.

Whereas Mr. Evensky and Mr. Thomas like some corporate bond funds, Ms. Rutledge advises sticking with specific municipal bonds. She says that to build a diversified fixed-income portfolio, investors need detailed information about the financial health of individual companies, which is often hard to find. It is particularly difficult now, when the overall economy is weak.

“There are probably some great opportunities in corporate debt funds,” she said, “but if you don’t know the company, don’t do it.”
259 2010-01-10 Returns in developing markets have regularly been sapped by crises, like the Mexican peso devaluation in 1994 and the Asian financial flu in 1997. The announcement in November that Dubai would delay repayment of some of its debts raised the possibility of yet another round of woe.

Because of the possibility of future blow-ups like these, advisers have long said that average investors should put only a small portion of their assets, if any, into emerging markets. Yet some investment professionals have begun to question whether today’s developing world is really as risky as its reputation — and to suggest that less sophisticated investors might consider putting more of their money there.

Jim O’Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, is among the best-known proponents of that view. In 2001, Mr. O’Neill coined the acronym “BRIC” as shorthand for the four largest economies in the developing world: Brazil, Russia, India and China. He argues that these countries, with hefty populations and solid economic fundamentals, should outpace the developed world over the next several decades.

“Because of the financial crisis, some people started to believe the BRIC thing was finished,” Mr. O’Neill said. “I’d argue that three of the four — especially China, but also Brazil and India — have demonstrated that they can live without U.S. growth leadership.”

Those three have resumed strong growth, despite the struggles in the developed world. Russia has lagged because of dependence on oil and gas, whose prices fell sharply with the recession. “It’s easy to dismiss Russia after oil prices lost 75 percent of their value in six months,” Mr. O’Neill said. “Let’s see later this year how they’re doing.”

The overall recent performance of emerging markets has led Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania, to conclude that they may be a better deal today than just a few years ago. “They’ve weathered a severe shock very well,” he said. Thus, investors aren’t foolish to buy the shares, even after the recent rapid price rise, he said.

The average price-to-earnings multiple for Chinese listings, for example, was in the low 20s in late 2009 and was projected to be 18 or 19 this year, he said. “That’s not cheap, but it’s not crazy for a rapidly growing country,” he said. “It’s not the 50 of 2007, when I was saying don’t go in there.”

Edmund J. Harriss, investment director at Guinness Atkinson in London, pointed to car sales as a harbinger of prospects for China and other big emerging markets. He said China would probably report 12 million sales for 2009, beating the United States by two million. “The size of the emerging economies is reaching a stage where they can sustain big growth in personal consumption,” he said. “If you get that, you should be looking to invest. That’s what drove America from the 1950s onward.”

Mr. Harriss oversees three Guinness Atkinson funds. The largest, the China & Hong Kong fund, had a total return of 92 percent last year. Among its biggest holdings at midyear were China Mobile, a telecom, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

Even proponents caution that emerging markets, despite their promise, remain risky. If a big crisis arises — perhaps widespread political unrest in China — it could sow broader panic, with investors fleeing as fast as they piled in. “Be aware that you can easily lose half of your investment in a few months,” said Mr. Chisholm of Acadian.

Risk is the reason that Towers Perrin, the employee-benefits consultant, often steers retirement plan managers away from including emerging-markets funds in 401(k) plans, said Darrell S. Zechman, a consultant in its Chicago office.

Many Americans don’t understand that investments in markets outside the United States entail currency and political risk along with the usual stock-market zigzags, he said. Such investors may also time investments poorly. “Traditionally, this is an asset class where people chase returns — they read in the news about a huge run-up and dump a lot of money in just before the market turns,” he said. “They get in at the peak and ride down to the trough.”

Towers Perrin typically suggests that retirement plans offer broad-based international funds, which can invest in any market outside the United States but keep most of their money in developed ones, Mr. Zechman said.

INVESTORS considering emerging markets might also want to ponder bird dung. Both bird droppings — specifically, guano deposited on Peruvian islands — and financial assets have produced speculative frenzies, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and an author of a recent book on financial crises.

In the 1800s, foreigners became enchanted with guano’s promise as a fertilizer and scooped up Peruvian bonds, Professor Rogoff said. Soon enough, the boom went bust, and Peru defaulted on its debt, wiping out the investors.

“It’s comical from a 21st-century perspective,” he said. “But guano was a huge technological advance for farming at the time.”
260 2010-01-10 The costs involved in complying with more stringent regulatory requirements can make mutual funds comparatively expensive to operate, too, while the fees they generate can be much lower. Mutual fund shareholders would balk at the 2-and-20 arrangement common among hedge funds — a 2 percent annual management fee plus 20 percent of any gain over the return of an agreed benchmark. Annual fees for mutual funds that use hedge fund strategies generally run between 1 and 2 percent.

FUND providers are making the move because their best clients, including wealthy individuals and institutions like university endowments and charitable foundations, are demanding it.

“Hedge funds are having difficulty raising assets,” said Andrew Rogers, president of Gemini Fund Services of Hauppauge, N.Y., which provides administrative and other functions for fund management companies. “If you can’t sell to your usual customers, you have to do other things.”

Broadmark Asset Management of New York came to that conclusion in 2008 and converted one of its hedge funds, which use exchange-traded funds to bet on a rising or falling stock market, into the Broadmark/Forward Tactical Growth mutual fund.

During the turbulent market conditions, shareholders of many hedge funds could not sell as a result of so-called gates, or clauses in the contracts that allowed managers to postpone meeting investor requests to cash out. Ricardo L. Cortez, Broadmark’s president of global distribution, said that prospective investors were reluctant to put themselves in a position where the same thing could happen to them.

Many funds and their shareholders “thought they had very liquid investments, but when push came to shove, people couldn’t get their money out,” Mr. Cortez said. “A lot of investors, as a result, said, ‘If I could get access to your fund with daily liquidity as a mutual fund, I’d be happy to take a look at that.’ We took a look at our strategy and said it would lend itself well to a mutual fund structure.”

Turner Investment Partners of Berwyn, Pa., made the same evaluation and last spring created Turner Spectrum, a mutual fund employing several stock trading strategies used in its hedge funds.

“For people coming off the plunge, a mutual fund gives them a feeling that they have control over their assets,” said Matthew Glaser, Spectrum’s lead manager. “With daily liquidity and daily pricing, you can see how your investments are doing.”

So just how are they doing? Long-short funds like Spectrum have underperformed the broad stock market by a fairly wide margin this year, but that’s what is supposed to happen.

These funds buy some stocks and sell others short. (This is what hedge funds did when they were invented decades ago, and it’s where the name comes from.) With limited net exposure to the stock market, they seldom outperform in strong bull markets or lose much in bear markets.

“These types of investments generally offer more stable patterns of returns,” said Louis P. Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh. “They generate positive or nearly positive returns when the stock market is negative but won’t necessarily do well when the market is up.”

He is a fan of funds using alternative strategies, especially Caldwell & Orkin Market Opportunity and Hussman Strategic Growth, which can take long and short stock positions. Another favorite is Rydex/SGI Managed Futures Strategy, which provides access to commodities and financial derivatives.

These types of funds are considered most useful in concert with other investments. Owning one can reduce the volatility of a broad portfolio without a corresponding reduction in returns, said Ms. Papagiannis, the Morningstar strategist.

A portfolio of index funds, 60 percent in stocks and the rest in bonds, gained 4.06 percent a year during the six years through September, she said. An allocation of 40 percent each to stocks and bonds and 20 percent to the JPMorgan Market Neutral fund, one of the oldest mutual funds using an alternative investment strategy, would have achieved a higher annualized gain, 4.52 percent, with much gentler swings.

Substitute Hussman Strategic Growth for the Morgan fund and the portfolio’s return would have been 4.20 percent a year, also produced with less volatility than the index fund portfolio, Ms. Papagiannis said.

“These are diversification tools, they’re not supposed to be the core holding in a portfolio,” she explained. “They’re supposed to perform when everything else is not, and they’re not supposed to lose much in the meantime. They’re good at protecting wealth, and often the best way to build wealth is not to lose it.”
261 2010-01-10 And the Nominees Should Be...
262 2010-01-10 Emily Lang Madison, a daughter of Sarah Lang of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Lawrence K. Madison of New York, was married Saturday evening, to Joseph Leo Sumberg, a son of Joanne L. Sumberg and John C. Sumberg of Miami. Rabbi Judith Kempler officiated at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Fla.

The bride and bridegroom, both 27, met at Washington University in St. Louis, from which they graduated.

The bride is pursuing a Master of Fine Arts in dramaturgy at Columbia. Her father, who is retired, was a health care administrator at the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation in New Hyde Park, N.Y. Her mother is the literacy coach at New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, N.Y.

The bridegroom is an associate at Goldman Sachs in New York, where he focuses on commercial real estate transactions. His mother retired as a broker associate at Avatar Real Estate Services in Miami. His father is the managing partner of the Miami law firm Bilzin Sumberg Baena Price & Axelrod.
263 2010-01-10 Emily Evans Eerdmans and Andrew John McKeon were married in New York on Wednesday. Soraida Burgos of the city clerk’s office officiated at the Marriage Bureau in Manhattan.

Ms. Eerdmans, 34, is keeping her name. She is a design historian and adjunct instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. She is the author of “Regency Redux” and “Classic English Design and Antiques,” published by Rizzoli in 2008 and 2006, respectively. She graduated from Oberlin College and received a master’s in fine and decorative arts from Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London.

She is the daughter of Jennifer Ilse Eerdmans of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Gerald K. Vasily of Bloomington, Ind. The bride’s father is a staff psychologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion, Ind. Her mother owns English Country Pottery in Grand Rapids. The bride is the stepdaughter of Helene Vasily.

Mr. McKeon, 51, is the founder and president of carbonRational, a consultancy in New York that advises businesses on energy use, water management and the use of environmentally sound materials. He graduated from the University of Bridgeport and received both a master’s in mechanical engineering and an M.B.A. from Columbia.

He is a son of the late Lorraine Doughney McKeon and the late Peter T. McKeon, who lived in Riverside, Conn. The bridegroom’s mother was the director of annual giving for the College of New Rochelle. His father retired as a senior claims representative from the White Plains office of Allstate. He was a New York City police officer from 1945 to 1963.
264 2010-01-10 We put in a few miles south of St. Louis but we didn’t know precisely how far we were going to go down the Father of Waters. We didn’t know whether we were going to camp every night on islands and sandbars, or stay in the small towns along the way. We didn’t know whether we were going to paddle hard to put miles under the hull or drift along like Huck (him?) and Jim (me?). It didn’t matter. The point was to experience the Mississippi from water level.

The Old Man, of course, was rolling on toward New Orleans, but we had no intention of going even a tenth that far. All we knew for certain was that we were headed toward that next corner there, and then around it to whatever lay beyond. With our holds full of power bars and instant oatmeal, we were hoping for sunshine but ready for rain.

Having no strict plan in place did not mean no planning was done, of course. With about 2,300 miles of river to choose from, we had to decide which section to paddle. We settled on the stretch just below St. Louis, in part because above St. Louis the Army Corps of Engineers has bottled up the river with locks and dams that stretch all the way to Minneapolis, making it more of a series of extremely pretty lakes than a rolling river.

What’s more, Missouri and Illinois are where, in a 190-mile stretch, the three great tributaries of the Mississippi come together. The Missouri, the Upper Mississippi and the Ohio can each lay some claim to being the true source of the mighty lower river of myth and mud: the roughly 1,300-mile Upper Mississippi, the river of the Great North Woods, has the historical claim to the name, but the Missouri, the “river of the West,” is, at more than 2,000 miles, the longest of the three by far.

The 980-mile Ohio, meanwhile, the line between slave and free and more recently the corroding keel of the industrial heartland, brings more water to the party than the other two combined. So we chose the stretch from St. Louis downriver to Cairo, Ill., where the Ohio comes in.

For weeks before our departure I amused myself plotting waypoints into my little hand-held GPS unit. I selected likely stopovers from topographical maps, looked up satellite photos and downloaded navigational charts. I cut and pasted and Googled, creating a personal guide with likely campsites and historical places to visit. Then, a few days before we were set to leave (driving from the East Coast), I called Hoppies Marina in Imperial, Mo., where I hoped we could park the car while we were on the river.

“This is Hoppie,” said a friendly male voice belonging to Charles Hopkins. “I suppose it would be fine to leave your truck here,” he said. “But, you know, that river is up. It’s just about at flood in St. Louis right now, and the Corps says it will be at flood tomorrow.”

Flood? Blithely assuming that by mid-June the river would be down in its summer mode, I had not even bothered to check the Corps of Engineers Web site that gives daily water levels. A quick check confirmed that the reading at St. Louis was 29 feet and rising toward flood level, 30 feet. The “technical” flood level does not mean water in the streets of river towns, but Mr. Hopkins explained that it did mean that all the pretty sandbars and campsites I had scoped out online would be underwater.

It meant as well that the current would be swifter and angrier about the countless submerged rock groins, jetties and other “improvements” constructed by the Corps of Engineers to keep the lower river navigable. It meant, in Mr. Hopkins’s opinion, that we shouldn’t be getting on the river in human-powered boats. “You want that reading at around 15 feet in St. Louis,” he advised. “That’s when the rock dikes come out of the water.”

We delayed our departure a few days and then did some exploring on land. In Davenport, Iowa, we ate krautdogs and watched the Quad Cities River Bandits play their Clinton, Iowa, rivals, the LumberKings, before a nearly sold-out home crowd. With the river as a backdrop, Modern Woodmen Park is arguably the prettiest modernized ballpark in all of professional baseball. “We don’t have to look retro,” says the team owner, David Heller. “Our ballpark was built in 1931 with W.P.A. funds. We are retro.”

We made the Mark Twain pilgrimage to Hannibal, Mo., where we saw and genuflected at “the house,” “the fence,” “the cave” and “the cabin.” Our favorite part was the homemade root beer and biscuits with gravy at the Mark Twain Family Restaurant.

By the time we got to St. Louis, the river was at 19 feet and dropping. We gave it one more day, going first to the astonishing Gateway Arch, which, like the moonshots of the era when it was built, leaves one wondering whether it is the technical or the political achievement that seems the more improbable by today’s standards. The architect, Eero Saarinen, supposedly wanted to build a monument that would last a thousand years.

In the afternoon we drove across the river and headed to Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in Collinsville, Ill., to see what was left of a city of mounds built a thousand years ago by members of what archaeologists call the Mississippian Culture. Their city was larger than London at the time and was (and still is) dominated by Monks Mound, a terraced earthwork comparable in volume to the Great Pyramid of Giza. For a long time, the Cahokia Mounds were essentially ignored, and many of them were flattened for farming and development, but now there’s an impressive visitors’ center. We walked the ancient plazas mostly in silence, trying to imagine them full of people.

AT last the morning came when we put the kayaks in the river at Hoppies and pointed them downstream. Hoppies is a classic sort of place: a house, a barn, a boat shop, a couple of outbuildings, a ramp and a dock where you’re more likely to find friendly guys working on their own well-traveled boats than a line of gleaming fiberglass trophies with bad puns for names. Hoppie and his wife, Fern, are usually around, talking or lending a hand. And, of course, there’s the river, brown and beautiful, rolling by without a care.

Human-powered trips — walking, hiking, paddling or cycling — usually begin with a warm-up period — hours or days of getting into the rhythm of the trip, letting go of where you came from, falling into the vibe. But that is not the case with launching a small boat on the Mississippi.

As soon as you are in the water, you know immediately that you belong to the river. It commands every sense. There’s the sound a truly big river makes — not loud, but nonetheless vast and soothing, more like a wind over grasses than a waterfall. There is an odor to the river as well, vaguely sweet and earthy, though oddly more like the sea than like a mountain lake. In no time Hoppies was lost far behind us, as if removed not just geographically, but in time as well. We were away.

Three sounds regularly punctuated the background music. One was the occasional wail of freight trains along tracks parallel to the river on the Missouri side. The arrival of trains is said to have been a death knell for the era of fabulous steamboats, but their songs today are neither unpleasant nor particularly lonesome; with miles of river bank on both sides undisturbed by houses or other signs of human impact, the occasional passing trains seemed to be friendly, if oblivious, fellow travelers.

The same could be said for the barges that ply the river in both directions, emitting a low, diesel roar and loaded with grain, gravel, giant rocks, oil and other commodities. Visions of these football-field-sized beasts swamping and slap-chopping our tiny boats had cost me sleep in the weeks leading up to our trip, and I certainly would not advise playing chicken with one in a fog, or traveling around a bend in mid-channel. But without diminishing the importance of vigilance and common nautical sense, there is nothing in their wakes to alarm a moderately experienced sea kayaker.

The most common sound is the surprisingly loud complaining of the river when it drops over and around the various contrivances of the engineers. It seemed to us that an Army Corps reading of 17 to 19 feet at St. Louis was actually better for paddlers than 15 feet, because the higher water covers the miscellaneous rock works, giving the visual impression of a free river. What’s more, once a paddler is comfortable with the current, the quickening drop, followed by the clot of whirlpools and eddies, creates interludes of adrenaline, which is to say fun.

The higher water also assured us that the chutes and sloughs that pass behind and around the various islands would have adequate water for passage, and it was along those narrower passages — though they were often big enough to be important rivers in any other part of the country — that we occasionally spotted deer, beaver, small water snakes, large herons and birds of prey. We looked for, but never saw, the coyotes we heard howling at night, sometimes closer to our campsites than we might have liked.

One afternoon we surprised a local family out catfishing; they were the only other recreationists we saw on the entire voyage. “Hey, come on over,” they called out from their campsite, a cluster of wall tents hidden almost entirely in the woods. “We got fresh fish frying and cold beer.” A very good combo indeed.

We might have seen more wildlife had we gotten up with the dawn and paddled till dusk, but we chose instead to read into the nights by the lights of our headlamps and sleep late; whether this was the influence of my teenage companion or the lull of the river I can’t say. We also might have covered more miles, but we stuck to our plan of no plan and dawdled with abandon.

On the Missouri side of the river we stopped once to check whether a dark spot in the bluff was the opening to a cave — it was not. We stopped another time to take a close look at a long row of boxcars on a siding. I will neither confirm nor deny that we climbed a ladder and ran along the top of the cars, high over the Mississippi, jumping from car to car, pretending to be Ernest Borgnine and Keith Carradine in “Emperor of the North Pole.”

On the Illinois side, we stashed our kayaks partway up One Mile Race Creek and walked along the levee about a mile to Fort de Chartres. Constructed in the 1750s and now fully restored, the fort was the military and administrative center for what was the breadbasket of French Colonial activity in North America. A few weeks before we arrived, the fort had been stuffed to the turrets with “living historians” dressed up as fur traders, native trappers and French infantry come for the annual jamboree, but when we got there it was deserted, except for the friendly woman in the gift shop who sold us ice-cold Sprites and told us about her technique in the tomahawk-throwing competitions.

“Pretty much everyone around here throws a little,” she told us.

Ducking out of there, we headed down the river to Ste. Genevieve, where we again stashed the kayaks in the woods and walked into town. We checked into a hotel, took hot showers, ate big steaks followed by enormous bowls of homemade ice cream, slept in beds and watched ball on television, but we were otherwise very well behaved for a couple of boatmen just in off the river.

Once a rival to St. Louis as the most important French community between New Orleans and the Great Lakes, Ste. Genevieve is a remarkably well-preserved town of historic houses, antiques shops and art galleries. Like virtually all of the towns we visited, however, it appeared to be highly detached from the river that was its original reason for existence: except for a sign showing historic flood levels, you might not know you were in a river town.

While we tarried in Ste. Genevieve, and the tiny towns of Tower Rock and Herculaneum, and spent a day hiking the bluffs at Trail of Tears State Park, and the better part of another day goofing around trying to catch fish, the river was rising. By the time we left Trail of Tears, the best camping sandbars were gone and the river was up in the trees in many places; the word was it was still coming up. When we got to Cape Girardeau, which has a wall to keep the river out of the town, it was no longer as much fun, and I took a Greyhound bus back up to St. Louis to get our car.

“What are you so worried about?” said my son as I hemmed and hawed and generally second-guessed our decision to get off the river a few days early. “We thought we might do 150 miles of the Mississippi,” he said, “and we did about 105. No one else we know has even done that.”

He was right, of course. But later that day we drove down to Cairo, a town that doesn’t look as if it’s been hit by the recession; it looks as if it’s been hit by a bomb (think Jimmy Carter in the South Bronx in 1977).

We sneaked into the seemingly abandoned and overgrown Fort Defiance Park and stood at the tip, where the massive Ohio River coming in from the East makes the Mississippi look more like the nephew of waters than the patriarch. It’s a surprisingly peaceful confluence of giants — one seemingly clear and dark, the other chalky with mud. We stood there until we worried that someone might break into our lonely car, loaded with our kayaks, up in the parking lot.

“I’ll be back,” I thought as we turned and jogged back. “There’s more drifting to do.”

The Army Corps of Engineers posts Mississippi River levels at a variety of locations (mvs-wc.mvs.usace.army.mil/dresriv.html) and also has downloadable navigational charts (www2.mvr.usace.army.mil/NIC2/mrcharts.cfm).

Hoppies Marina is across the tracks at the end of a road in Imperial, Mo. (6018 Windsor Harbor Lane; 636-467-6154), but you should call ahead and make sure there’s room by the barn if you plan to leave a car there. The owners may not quote you an official fee, but a reasonable traveler will give something in return for the privilege of launching and parking at the marina.

WHERE TO STAY (AND EAT)

While traveling on the river, you can camp anywhere that isn’t posted as private property. On the stretch between St. Louis and Cairo, Ill., the sandbars that form at the ends of islands are often good spots. Because mud is a fact of life on the Mississippi — even on top of sand — campers should take plastic tarps for ground cloths and plenty of fresh water.

There are public campsites at Fort Kaskaskia State Historic Site (4372 Park Road, Ellis Grove, Ill.; 618-859-3741; www.illinoishistory.gov/hs/fort_kaskaskia.htm) and at Trail of Tears State Park (429 Moccasin Springs, Jackson, Mo.; 573-290-5268; www.mostateparks.com/trailoftears.htm).

The Hotel Ste. Genevieve (Main and Merchant Streets, Ste. Genevieve, Mo.; 573-883-3562) is a serviceable place that didn’t question our arrival in water sandals. Doubles from $55. At the nearby Inn St. Gemme Beauvais (78 North Main Street, also in Ste. Genevieve; 573-883-5744; www.bbhost.com/innstgemme/), doubles start at $89.

The Anvil Saloon (46 South Third Street, Ste. Genevieve; 573-883-7323) has been restoring river travelers since 1855. The Anvil steak (ribeye) comes with memorable onion rings for $18.95.

286 2010-01-11 Art Clokey, the animator who half a century ago created Gumby, that most pliant of pop-cultural figures, died on Friday at his home in Los Osos, Calif. He was 88.

His son, Joe Clokey, said he died in his sleep.

Asparagus green and fashioned from clay, Gumby made his television debut in 1956 on “The Howdy Doody Show.” The next year, he became the star of “The Gumby Show,” in which he embarked on a string of gently quixotic adventures with his supple steed, Pokey. The series was one of the first extended uses of stop-motion animation on television.

Though the 1950s show was fairly short-lived, Gumby reappeared in new series in the 1960s and in the 1980s and continued for years in syndication. He also starred in a feature film, “Gumby: The Movie” (1995), directed by Mr. Clokey.

Gumby is now firmly ensconced in popular culture. He dangles from rearview mirrors, appears in video games and crops up ubiquitously in references in film and on television. Millions of Gumby dolls have submitted to their owners’ manipulations. The character has been satirized, notably by Eddie Murphy, who played him as a cigar-chomping vulgarian — “I’m Gumby, dammit!” — on “Saturday Night Live” in the 1980s.

With his first wife, Ruth, Mr. Clokey also produced “Davey and Goliath,” the adventures of a boy and his dog, broadcast in the 1960s and ’70s.

288 2010-01-11 “I will also confess I am surprised Pfizer is doing it,” he added, “and I don’t know how many more times they will give money with no strings attached.”

Pfizer, in a statement, said it wanted to help redefine how continuing medical education was financed to ensure the independence and patient benefit of the programs, which most doctors are required to take to maintain their state medical licenses.

Still, some saw inherent conflicts in the Pfizer connection.

“The announcement is self-satirizing,” said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a Georgetown University medical professor who has researched and written about industry influence in continuing medical education. “Pfizer’s interest in better ways to manipulate physicians is well-known.”

Stanford said the curriculum would focus on areas that needed improvement, like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking cessation and infections. The university plans to use advanced technologies, including a simulated hospital, rather than lecturing.

“The Pfizer grant comes with no conditions, and the company will not be involved in developing the curriculum,” according to a medical school press release.

But Dr. Fugh-Berman said that Pfizer has major products in two of the four areas that the Stanford press release suggested might be pursued: smoking cessation and heart disease.

Dr. Pizzo, the Stanford dean said he was aware that the grant from Pfizer would receive some skepticism. “I think that’s appropriate because I have a certain guarded skepticism or optimism about this, too,” he said. “It remains to be seen how this eventually works.”

Drug and medical device companies have paid more than $1 billion a year for continuing medical education through universities, disease associations and private vendors, about half the total cost of the programs. The industry’s influence on topic selection, tone of presentations and advice given to doctors has spurred calls for reform from the Institute of Medicine, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Pfizer has a checkered history of using such education courses to promote off-label use of its drugs. For instance Pfizer paid $2.3 billion last year to settle government fraud charges of deceptive marketing, including sponsoring supposedly independent programs promoting off-label uses for the pain drug Bextra.

In 2008, it became the first drug company to say it would no longer provide such money directly to profit-making medical education companies, but only to universities and other nonprofits. But a $780,000 grant from Pfizer to the Canadian Medical Association for educational programs drew criticism because the company was given two seats on a six-member supervisory board. And a $3.4 million grant last year for the California Academy of Family Physicians to sponsor stop-smoking educational programs was questioned because Pfizer makes Chantix, a smoking cessation drug.

Dr. Arnold S. Relman, a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, a Harvard professor emeritus, an outspoken critic of industry conflicts and a friend of Dr. Pizzo, said he could not understand the rationale behind the arrangement.

“If it is true — a big, big if — but if it is true that this money is being given without any strings at all and without any obligation on the part of Stanford to please Pfizer, then it’s arguable that it’s O.K.,” Dr. Relman said.

“But it’s just not a good idea for a profession that says it wants to be independent and trusted, a reliable source of information to the profession and the public about drugs, to take money from the drug company under any conditions.”

In September 2008, the Stanford medical school became the first in the nation to stop accepting industry financing for specific topics in postgraduate educational programs. It will accept only industry money that was pooled in a general fund for the education programs.
289 2010-01-11 A federal judge in Washington, Ricardo Urbina, has provided another compelling argument against the outsourcing of war to gunslingers from the private sector. In throwing out charges against agents who killed 17 Iraqis in Baghdad’s Nisour Square in September 2007, Judge Urbina highlighted the government’s inability to hold mercenaries accountable for crimes they commit.

Judge Urbina correctly ruled that the government violated the Blackwater agents’ protection against self-incrimination. He sketched an inept prosecution that relied on compelled statements made by the agents to officials of the State Department, who employed the security firm to protect convoys and staff in . That, he said, amounted to a “reckless violation of the defendants’ constitutional rights.”

During the presidential campaign, and competed over who would take the toughest line against mercenaries. It is clear that the only way for to make good on the rhetoric is to get rid of the thousands of private gunmen still deployed in Iraq, and elsewhere.

The killings in Nisour Square were hardly the first misdeeds by hired guns in Iraq, or the last. The army has said contractors from firms like were involved in more than a third of the proven incidents of abuse in 2003 and 2004 in the prison. Guards from Blackwater — which has renamed itself Xe Services — and other security firms, like Triple Canopy, have been involved in other wanton shootings.

On Jan. 7, two former Blackwater guards were arrested on murder charges stemming from a shooting in Afghanistan last May that left two Afghans dead.
290 2010-01-11 “Over the years, it didn’t seem like Fox even took them seriously,” Mr. Beck said. (In early 2002, Fox contemplated selling the studio.) “And even though Blue Sky has found hits, there are still quality questions.”

“The quality of the work is up there with anything that is done from any company in the business,” said Tom Rothman, a chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment. Added Vanessa Morrison, president of Fox Animation Studios, which includes Blue Sky: “Being away from Hollywood really helps to incubate talent. Our films really take people to a place they’ve never been before.”

Blue Sky now has an incredible amount of pressure to keep the hits coming. A fourth “Ice Age” is in the works — the studio is working to nail down agreements with the voice cast — and Chris Wedge, a Blue Sky co-founder and the director of the first “Ice Age,” is working to develop “The Leaf Men,” based on the book by William Joyce.

Next up, however, is an original 3-D feature called “Rio,” planned for release in April 2011. Set in Rio de Janeiro, the movie is billed as a comedy-adventure that centers on Blu, a rare macaw who thinks he is the last of his kind. When he discovers there is another — and that it’s a she — he leaves his small Minnesota town for Rio. Mayhem ensues.

The cast includes Anne Hathaway, Tracy Morgan, George Lopez and Jesse Eisenberg, of “Zombieland” fame. Carlos Saldanha, the Brazilian-born director of “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,” among other Blue Sky films, will also direct “Rio.”

“We’re working really hard to raise the bar here — the realism of the harbor, how the slums look, the way the feathers on our bird characters move,” said Brian Keane, Blue Sky’s chief operating officer.

Computer-animated movies have become anything but child’s play to Hollywood. Aside from their box-office potential, these pictures can deliver enormous merchandising profits and — so far at least — are holding up better in the DVD aisle than their live-action counterparts. Partly that is because of their power as electronic baby sitters.

But the animation gold rush is increasing in intensity as cinematic technology evolves. When Pixar and DreamWorks pioneered the art of concocting entire three-dimensional worlds out of nothing but computer code, at least at the multiplex, the technology was more than others could easily copy.

Not anymore. Upstart studios like Imagi Animation Studios (“Astro Boy”) are now able to take advantage of breakthroughs bankrolled by the animation giants. The likes of Warner Brothers, Sony and Universal Pictures are also racing to mine the genre, spending hundreds of millions on movies like “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” and a sequel to “Happy Feet.”

“Avatar,” which relies on newly developed motion-capture equipment and has sold over $1 billion at the global box office, is to a large extent an animated film.

Blue Sky got its start in 1987, opening above a dentist’s office in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. Dulcolax was its first customer, but the studio soon made a name for itself in animation circles for taking on quirky, dark projects. “Bunny,” about a tattered rabbit, won the 1998 Oscar for an animated short. Other work included “Joe’s Apartment,” the MTV Films comedy featuring thousands of singing cockroaches, and the talking fish episode from the “The Sopranos.”

At Blue Sky headquarters in Greenwich, about 400 employees toil on the big commercial films required by Fox, which bought the studio in 1997. The work can be draining — each animator delivers only about four or five seconds of footage each week — but there are all of the creature comforts associated with creative enterprises: video games, a big gym, free cereal. Mr. Keane is hiring 40 more employees.

Lately, it has been all “Rio” all the time. Animators working on the film recently took a trip to the Bronx Zoo to sketch birds, and others have learned to samba in the name of their craft. On a recent afternoon, workers headed to Blue Sky’s auditorium — some via scooter — for a demonstration of the Brazilian martial art capoeira. About 100 artists sketched and asked questions about incorporating the moves into “Rio.”

“We might not be very Hollywood out here, but we still know how to have fun,” Mr. Keane said.
291 2010-01-11 As it prepares to pay out big bonuses to employees, Goldman Sachs is considering expanding a program that would require executives and top managers to give a certain percentage of their earnings to charity.

The move would be the latest in a series of initiatives by Goldman to soften criticism over the size of its bonuses, which are expected to be among the largest on Wall Street, bringing average pay to about $595,000 for each employee  with far higher amounts for top performers.

Goldman set aside $16.7 billion for compensation in the first nine months of 2009, and in good years, the firm dedicates about three-quarters of its compensation budget to year-end bonuses. The firm is expected to report later this month what could be record profit of about $12 billion for 2009, according to analysts’ estimates, compared with $11.7 billion in 2007. Its final compensation pool and executive bonuses will be announced then.

The firm said last month that its 30 most senior executives would be paid bonuses all in stock, but the bank placed no limit on how large those bonuses might be.

While the details of the latest charity initiative are still under discussion, the firm’s executives have been looking at expanding their current charitable requirements for months and trying to understand whether such gestures would damp public anger over pay, according to a person familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified because of the delicacy of the pay issue.

The charity idea would be similar to a decades-long program at the failed investment bank Bear Stearns, which required more than 1,000 of its top workers to give 4 percent of their pay to charity each year and then checked their tax returns to ensure compliance.

Assuming a similar percentage and level of participation, that would mean Goldman’s top employees would commit to giving hundreds of millions of dollars to charity, though the precise amount would depend on the level of contributions and the number of workers who are required to take part.

It could not be determined whether Goldman would create a new program for its mandated giving or run it through Goldman Sachs Gives, which oversees donor-directed charity funds for Goldman workers. That program was created in 2007, weeks before Goldman paid its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, $68 million for that year. It required Goldman’s 400 or so partners to give an undisclosed amount to charity each year on their own or through the program.

Amid a growing public outcry over big bonuses at Goldman and other Wall Street banks, Goldman in October said the firm itself would donate $200 million to its charitable foundation, nearly doubling its size. (The foundation is separate from GS Gives.) It also created a $500 million fund to lend to small businesses, a sector that has suffered in the tight credit environment. The plan will be overseen in part by Warren E. Buffett, who is a large Goldman investor.

Moreover, the firm  which initially was on track to pay closer to $650,000 to $700,000 on average to its workers  has scaled back planned bonuses by cutting the amount of revenue set aside for compensation, apparently in response to negative public reaction. People familiar with the matter said that Goldman was planning to further reduce the portion of revenue dedicated to compensation in the fourth quarter.

Still, these moves have done little to quell criticism of banker bonuses, and it is unclear if Goldman’s latest idea, if adopted, would alter the public mood and the feeling in Washington that big pay packages are inappropriate given the troubled economy.

On Sunday, Christina D. Romer, head of the president’s top economic council, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that it was “ridiculous” that banks planned to pay out billions in bonuses for last year.

The payout, she said, “is going to offend the American people. It offends me.”

For their work in 2008, 953 Goldman employees were paid more than $1 million each; the bank accepted $10 billion in federal bailout cash, though it has since repaid the money, as have most other banks, freeing them of government limits on compensation.

Goldman, like its peers, is caught between conflicting constituencies. The bank cut worker pay somewhat last year, and some employees may leave for hedge funds or private equity firms if they are not paid handsomely for their contributions to the firm’s profits. Some shareholders, however, want the bank to divert more of its money to them as dividends, though others think it should pay to keep workers happy.

In the meantime, the public has little sympathy for bankers expecting compensation to return to previous levels.

The most important public relations tactic Goldman and other banks may use, headhunters said, is to instruct their employees to keep their heads down.

“They’ll try to make sure their people aren’t going out and celebrating their financial wins,” said Maurice Toueg, a recruiter with Capstone Partnership.
292 2010-01-11 Nickelodeon has ordered 20 episodes of “Team Umizoomi.” If it catches on, it could also open a new revenue source for the company, in ancillary educational products. Ms. Zarghami said that Nickelodeon is exploring introducing teaching videos, workbooks and “learning tools that go with the show, as opposed to the more traditional toys and plush.”

Currently the company licenses some of its properties, including “Dora the Explorer” and “Go, Diego, Go!” for tie-in math and reading games made by others, but it has no shows whose product lines are specifically education-oriented.

In some ways the new program is standard children’s fare. The main characters are miniature superheroes — a boy, a girl and a break-dancing robot — who zoom about fixing simple crises in their city, whether a shortage of milk, a lost kite or a subway system stalled by a dropped mitten. But the show is infused in all aspects — down to character Milli’s pony tails that turn into a ruler — with concepts from an interactive math curriculum that the characters tap to solve their problems, including shape-matching, counting, simple computation and measurement.

The Nick Jr. Web site, nickjr.com, will have a learning section for parents, including the curriculum and activities to help preschoolers master the concepts, as well as games and videos.

Soo Kim, who worked on “Blue’s Clues” and is one of “Team Umizoomi’s” creators and writers and its design director, said the show was built on the idea that “preschoolers naturally encounter their world by using their math,” matching buttons to holes or counting out pancakes for breakfast.

The message to children, she said, is “you’re already great at math.” Pop songs, like one with the refrain “Shapes all over the place” in the first episode, are modeled after ABC’s “Schoolhouse Rock” ditties, which endured long after they left the air.

Nickelodeon’s programming has become “increasingly more educational as time has passed,” Ms. Zarghami said. “Blue’s Clues” promotes interactivity, with its pauses for children to find the clues, and “Dora The Explorer” teaches short Spanish phrases while the character is on her adventures. With “Team Umizoomi,” she said, there is “no disguising that it’s math.”

The show does not signal a major shift in the network’s shows. “I believe we have enough equity with moms based on our track record to take on more educational stuff head-on, and they would trust us to do it well,” said Ms. Zarghami, but “social skills are still really important.”
293 2010-01-11 ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuters) — Ivo Josipovic, the opposition presidential candidate, won a runoff election on Sunday and promised to help complete European Union membership talks so Croatia can join in 2012.

Mr. Josipovic, a member of the Social Democrat Party who is a law expert and classical music composer, but who has relatively little experience in national politics, won 60.3 percent of the vote in the second-round runoff.

He will be Croatia’s third president since independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.

Mr. Josipovic defeated Milan Bandic, the Zagreb mayor who was supported by the Roman Catholic Church and more conservative voters. Mr. Bandic took 39.7 percent of the vote as an independent candidate.

Mr. Josipovic promised to support Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor’s effort to implement reforms and fight widespread corruption, as required to complete European Union membership talks this year.

The candidate of Ms. Kosor’s governing conservative HDZ party failed to reach the runoff. But Ms. Kosor, who took over in July, remains the country’s most popular politician.

Mr. Josipovic will succeed Stjepan Mesic, whose second five-year term ends in February.
294 2010-01-11 In recent years, drug makers have paid greater attention to culling their ample portfolio of medicines. Marginally profitable medicines or small-selling drugs with particularly challenging manufacturing processes were often sold off by large drug makers to smaller companies, which paid for them by immediately increasing the drugs’ prices.

Most of the big price increases ranged from 100 percent to 499 percent, but some of the price increases were far larger, the investigators found. For instance, the prices of 26 brand-name drugs rose more than tenfold. The largest price increase found by the investigators was about 4,200 percent.

Nearly a third of the drugs whose prices were substantially raised were intended to treat depression, anxiety and other disorders of the central nervous system, while many others were intended to treat infections or cardiovascular problems.

The price for a drug intended to treat a rare form of cancer went from $390 for a full course of treatment to more than $3,000, investigators found.

The drugs’ makers were not always behind the price rises. In more than half of the cases disclosed by investigators, the price increases were made by a middleman that bought the medicines from manufacturers and repackaged them for hospitals or doctors.

With thousands of approved medicines, the market for drugs in the United States is enormously complicated. Myriad players — manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and providers — often play some role in pricing. For some small-selling medicines, prices and availability can change significantly year to year.

But much of the money in the system goes to a relatively small number of huge-selling medicines whose prices start high and are made even higher by modest and frequent price increases. Last year, overall wholesale prices of brand-name drugs rose 9 percent even as the Consumer Price Index fell.

One reason for the price increases might be that drug makers are bracing for the effects of the health care overhaul effort in Congress. Another is that drug makers’ labs have been unusually barren, and that without new products, drug makers view price increases as among the only ways to reliably increase profits.

“It is hard to find a good-faith explanation for why drug prices could go up this much,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. “This report will lead to a strong demand for action by Congress.”

322 2010-01-12 An entertainment promotion company owned by Abu Dhabi has bought a 10 percent stake in the Ultimate Fighting Championship for an undisclosed sum. A U.F.C. co-owner, Lorenzo Fertitta, said the deal with Flash Entertainment, a subsidiary owned by the Abu Dhabi government, was done to create increased value for U.F.C. and help the mixed martial arts league expand in the Middle East and Asia. Neither Fertitta nor Ossama Khoreibi, the chairman of Flash, would estimate U.F.C.’s worth or say what Flash paid for the newly issued shares in Zuffa L.L.C., its parent company. Fertitta said terms of the deal were confidential. Fertitta said he believed Flash — a promoter known for bringing high-profile concerts and other events to the Middle East — could accelerate U.F.C.’s growth there and in China, India and other countries.
323 2010-01-12 Looking ahead makes sense to a point, but investors seem to be forgetting the X-factor between now and then: the removal of government support for markets. The Federal Reserve, for instance, is on track to hit its $1.25 trillion limit for purchases of mortgage bonds by the end of March, while the Bank of England expects to end its asset purchase program next month.

It’s all part of a process of withdrawing government money even before lifting interest rates. It’s unlikely that every stage in this process will be timed to perfection. Along the way, the removal of official support is likely to dent the values of many assets, including junk debt and others like government bonds and stocks that look fully priced today.

It’s hard not to conclude that investors have gotten ahead of themselves in their relief that the worst is over, especially in risky debt markets where the specter of mass defaults has receded. That’s a relief, but other risks still out there now merit junk bond buyers’ full attention.

The Dutch brewer Heineken has managed a delicate balancing act in clinching the auction for the beer business of Femsa of Mexico. Despite outbidding SABMiller, the deal is in line with prices paid for growing Latin American markets. Meanwhile, Heineken’s all-share offer keeps debt under control while leaving its founding family in charge.

Heineken wanted the additional emerging market exposure Femsa offered. But because it’s still paying debt from other deals, it could not offer cash. Investors had feared Heineken would turn to them for new capital. But the Femsa deal sidesteps the issue.

Heineken is effectively issuing shares in its operating company as well as its holding company to pay for the Femsa unit. In return, the Mexican group gets a 20 percent economic interest in Heineken and two seats on the company’s supervisory board.

Meanwhile, the Heineken family keeps its grip on the operating company with holdings of just more than 50 percent. And a five-year lock-up for Femsa ensures stability on Heineken’s shareholder register.

The deal will catapult Heineken to No. 2 in Mexico behind Grupo Modelo, in a country that is the world’s fourth-largest beer market by profits. It also makes Heineken one of the top three brewers in Brazil, which is the second-largest beer market behind the United States. Heineken, which is based in Amsterdam, also expects the deal to increase imports into the United States and its position in America’s growing Hispanic market.

This position does not come cheap. The enterprise value of $7.6 billion puts Femsa’s business at 11.2 times operating cash flow, in line with other emerging market beer deals, like SABMiller’s purchase of Bavaria in Colombia in 2005. Still, the deal will not cover Heineken’s cost of capital for six years.

Moreover, the final price isn’t fixed. Heineken has to buy back 29 million shares over the next five years. They will be handed to Femsa. If Heineken’s share price continues to rise, so will the cost of the acquisition.

This deferred structure offers some insurance to shareholders: the final cost depends in part on whether Heineken delivers on its promises. Nevertheless, it is also a reminder that Heineken’s Latin American brew does not come without risks. AGNES T. CRANE and ALEXANDER SMITH
324 2010-01-12 Three quick technical fouls by the Boston coaching staff added up to a third straight victory for Atlanta over the Celtics.

Celtics Coach Doc Rivers drew two quick technicals and was automatically ejected. The assistant Armond Hill was then assessed a technical before Rivers was even off the court, handing the Hawks a 4-point play and helped whittle away a 10-point deficit in a 102-96 victory Monday night in Boston.

“I think it started with the technicals,” said Jamal Crawford, who made the three free throws on his way to 17 points in the game. “We got some free throws and easy points. Seeing the ball go through the basket gives you confidence.”

The Celtics, without Rasheed Wallace who was out with a sore left foot, have lost only 10 games all season.

Boston had a 67-57 lead with 6 minutes 16 seconds left in the third when Glen Davis was called for a flagrant foul for riding Marvin Williams away from the basket on a fast break. Rivers was irate, receiving the second technical just a few seconds after the first when he did not stop yelling at the referee Bennett Salvatore.
325 2010-01-12 I am one of those people referred to by Judith Warner who have been prescribing and studying antidepressants — in my case, for 30 years. Every point made by Ms. Warner is dead-on:

Antidepressants do work for people who are really depressed; they don’t for people who aren’t. Depression is frequently diagnosed in people who don’t have it, and frequently not diagnosed in those who do.

Medications that work for depression are commonly misused, and types of psychotherapy that work for depression are commonly not used at all. The reasons for this state of affairs include mistrust of authority, stigma, big-stakes health care economics, cross-discipline rivalries and simplistic thinking (within the mental health care field as well as the general public).

The excesses of the media and the perverse incentives of our current health care delivery system make things worse.

I am, sadly, less hopeful than Ms. Warner that health care reform will help rectify things. I am more hopeful that advances in our understanding of depression itself will enable us to more accurately diagnose it, so that individuals in distress, whether from depression or other problems, get the help they actually need.

The writer, a psychiatrist, is professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University and clinical director and director of research at Butler Hospital.

In her article about treatments for depression, Judith Warner cites a group of psychologists who said that “relatively few psychologists learn or practice” interventions that these researchers deemed “effective.”

Research since the 1970s has consistently established the effectiveness of psychotherapy for treatment of conditions like depression when the therapy is conducted by a highly trained person who holds to a philosophy of psychotherapy (the philosophy does not much matter, as long as the therapist has one).

The more recent debate about “evidence-based” therapies is an old one in the psychological world, pitting our competent researchers against clinicians.

While researchers can investigate treatments in laboratory conditions, few clients fit into simple categories. Try applying an “evidence-based treatment” for a depressed, sexually abused child from a divorced family in which one parent is alcoholic and the child has a learning disability. Such clients do not tend to show up for laboratory studies and don’t tend to respond to simple bromides.

It is also untrue that psychologists do not learn about evidenced-based treatments. Nearly all psychologists in all states must take continuing education and are thereby exposed to the current research about psychological conditions and treatments. The best clinicians practice flexibility in approach, depending on the needs of their patients.

The writer, a child and adolescent psychologist, is a former president of the Ohio Psychological Association.

The article by Judith Warner as well as the original study on depression are likely to do harm to many Americans with depression. For decades, it has been recognized that the recognition and treatment of depression require that primary-care physicians both screen for and, when appropriate, treat depression. This treatment may take many forms, including the use of pharmacologic agents.

Many of those who need treatment have no access to psychiatrists because of geographical distribution, restrictive insurance coverage, cost or a perceived stigma to being cared for by a psychiatrist. Thus, distortion or misinterpretation of the evidence about the treatment of depression will result in those who desperately need help not obtaining it.

My colleagues and I spent many years in convincing family physicians and others that chronic depression is an important and treatable disease. Yes, some of the financing was from the pharmaceutical industry, but much of it came from federal agencies and others whose sole motivation was the health of the public. Because of this, we have made significant gains in the treatment of depression.

The writer is a former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Judith Warner hits the nail on the head: the more accurate story about mental health treatment is the lack of parity with the diagnosis and treatment of other illnesses like cancer, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

People with emotional problems suffer stigma and are vulnerable to fragmented systems of care, and the pressure to prescribe as a quick fix for complex problems. Cost-effective, evidenced-based treatments in which judicious use of medication is combined with counseling reduce crippling symptoms and expand quality of life.

Whether or not we enable those with mental illness to recover dreams damaged by their disease remains an ethical challenge.

326 2010-01-12 Extremist Hutus in Rwanda’s government in 1994 were responsible for shooting down a plane carrying the Rwandan president, who was also a Hutu, in a premeditated attack that set off a spiral of violence that led to genocide, according to a report released Monday by the current Rwandan government.

The report, requested by President Paul Kagame, accused members of the Rwandan armed forces of firing surface-to-air missiles at a private jet that was carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi as they were returning from peace talks in Tanzania on April 6, 1994.

The report, a result of more than two years of research, including more than 500 interviews and input from British ballistics experts, also includes allegations about the French military that are related to the assassination.

The role of the crash in catapulting Rwanda, a tiny central African country, into violence that left about 800,000 minority Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead is well documented. But the question of who shot down the president’s airplane had remained a matter of dispute.

The current government, which is mostly Tutsi, and many independent historians have long contended that senior members of the Hutu-dominated government plotted to kill Mr. Habyarimana to set off ethnic violence. That hypothesis remains a cornerstone of the current government’s legitimacy and historical narrative.

Critics, though, have contended that the Kagame government’s reluctance to investigate the plane crash implied doubts about who was really responsible. These critics view the report’s conclusions as unsurprising.
327 2010-01-12 Could you explain how Goldman bet against these C.D.O.’s while simultaneously trying to persuade ratings agencies and investors that they were good investments? Were they designed from the outset to be shorted by Goldman and possibly select clients? And were those clients involved in helping design these transactions? What explicit disclosures did you make to and about your plans to short these instruments? And should we continue to allow transactions in which you’re betting against what you’re also selling?

Mr. Dimon, during the final week before collapsed, your firm asked Lehman to post billions of dollars in collateral and threatened to stop clearing Lehman’s trades if it didn’t do so. That demand had the effect of depleting Lehman’s capital base, just when it desperately needed that capital to return funds to investors who were asking for their money back.

JPMorgan clearly was trying to protect itself. But could you explain what impact you believe that “collateral call” had on Lehman’s failure and the ensuing ?

This one is for the entire group. All of your firms are involved in some form of proprietary trading, or using your own capital to make financial bets, not unlike hedge funds and other private investors. As the recent crisis has shown, these bets can go catastrophically wrong and endanger the global financial system.

Given that the government sent a clear signal in the crisis that it would not let the biggest firms fail, why should taxpayers guarantee this sort of trading? Why should the government backstop what amounts to giant hedge funds inside the walls of your firms? How is such trading helpful to the broader financial system?

A question for all the executives about bonuses: We keep hearing that you plan to pay out billions in bonuses this year. Given that they come out of profits that, to a large degree, seem to be the result of government programs to prop up and stimulate the banking sector, do you think they are deserved, even if they are in stock? And, while we’re on the topic, given the market crisis of 2008, were you all overpaid in 2007?

Again, for the group: Over the last year, your firms have actively used the ’s discount window to exchange various investments (including C.D.O.’s) for cash. You probably have a better idea than most about what those assets now sitting on the Fed’s balance sheet are worth.

Given the growing calls for regular audits of the Fed (an idea being resisted by the likes of the chairman, ), do you think the demands for such audits are warranted?

This question is for Mr. Mack. In November, in a surprisingly candid moment, you publicly declared, “Regulators have to be much more involved.” You then added, “We cannot control ourselves.” Can you elaborate on those comments? Is Wall Street inherently incapable of policing itself — a view contrary to what most of your peers have argued?

Mr. Blankfein. Your firm, like other on this panel, was paid in full by the on various financial contracts, thanks to the government’s bailout. You can understand how this has whipped up no small amount of fury and questions over why A.I.G. and the government did not try to renegotiate those contracts.

Because your firm was the largest beneficiary of the government’s decision, did you or any of your employees lobby the Fed, or any other government agency for this “100 cents on a dollar” payout? If so, enlighten us about those conversations.

This is for Mr. Moynihan. Please explain — and no jargon, please — why your firm believed it didn’t have to disclose mounting losses at ahead of a shareholder vote in December 2008. After all, investigations into the matter suggest company executives knew of the $4.5 billion loss Merrill suffered in October before that vote.

And why, just a week or so after you became general counsel, did Bank of America decide to tell the government about those same losses that it chose not to tell shareholders about?

To Mr. Dimon and Mr. Moynihan: Your industry has vigorously opposed creating a consumer protection agency. But it’s clear that your millions of retail customers weren’t adequately protected, leading to hardship and heartbreak across the nation. Because you oppose creating such a regulator, what should be done to ensure these problems don’t happen again?
328 2010-01-12 A federal judge in Manhattan was asked on Monday to dismiss an indictment against a terror suspect whose lawyer argued that his nearly five-year detention in secret C.I.A. prisons and later at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, was “perhaps the most egregious violation in the history of speedy-trial jurisprudence.”

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court, listened as a lawyer for the suspect, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, indicated that he was not challenging the government’s authority to decide to detain his client or the wisdom of that decision. The government held Mr. Ghailani to try to obtain intelligence about Al Qaeda.

But the government “cannot have it both ways,” said the lawyer, Peter E. Quijano.

Once these decisions are made, he added, “they can’t just simply change their mind, their political mind, 57 months later, and say, ‘You know, that indictment before Judge Kaplan? Let’s try it now.’ ”

The judge did not say when he would rule. The debate over the significance of the delays in bringing Mr. Ghailani to trial arises in a case that is seen as crucial because it could foreshadow a key issue in the prosecution of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the professed organizer of the 9/11 attack, and four other Guantánamo detainees accused in the plot who were recently ordered to New York for trial.

Last spring, Mr. Ghailani became the first Guantánamo detainee moved into the civilian court system. A Tanzanian, he faces charges of conspiring in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa, which killed more than 200 people. He later worked for Osama bin Laden as a bodyguard and a cook, military authorities have said.
329 2010-01-12 The strategy that Mark McGwire used Monday to lay out his admission to using steroids demonstrated that lessons were learned from other baseball stars who preceded him in making mea culpa about their drug use.

He did it all in one afternoon, starting with a statement that was distributed widely to the news media, and that came across the Associated Press wire at 3 p.m.

The A.P. followed quickly with a story that featured an interview with McGwire, who subsequently spoke to numerous other news media outlets  including USA Today and The St. Louis Post-Dispatch; Tim Kurkjian and John Kruk of ESPN (both by telephone, not on the air); KTRS Radio in St. Louis; and The New York Times, before talking to Bob Costas live at 7 p.m. Eastern on MLB Network.

The one-day plan  coordinated over the past month by Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary who runs a crisis-communications company, and the St. Louis Cardinals, who recently hired McGwire as their batting coach  contrasts with last year’s roll-out of Alex Rodriguez’s steroid admission.

Last February, Rodriguez’s steroid use was first reported by Selena Roberts on SI.com; three days later, he confessed to ESPN in an interview with Peter Gammons that lacked adequate follow-up questions; eight days later, Rodriguez responded to questions at a news conference at the Yankees’ spring training camp as his teammates looked on.

That all came more than a year after Rodriguez denied using steroids to Katie Couric of CBS News.

Rodriguez lacked any arrogance in his confession, unlike Roger Clemens, whose drug-use denials have been defiant and angry. The genial Andy Pettitte took two months to speak about his use of human growth hormone after it was revealed in late 2007 in the Mitchell report that investigated drug use in baseball.

McGwire had been silent since his embarrassing refusal to discuss his steroid use during a Congressional hearing nearly five years ago. His strategy back then, concocted with avoiding prosecution on his mind, made him appear hapless and as guilty as if he had confessed. This time, McGwire and his handlers surely knew his credibility would be enhanced if he confessed before spring training and made himself widely available, not only on Monday but Tuesday. An interview with ESPN is to be scheduled, but because it’s not exclusive, its thunder will be muted.

McGwire’s personality has usually been low key, and he has not always been comfortable with the news media.

In his repeated confessions Monday, he had no defiance or anger, just sadness and tears.

“I like the door-to-door strategy, in that he is telling his story in long form and in less confrontational settings,” said Kevin Sullivan, a former White House communications director who runs a strategic-communications company. “He needed to rip the Band-Aid off before heading to spring training.”

Sullivan added: “I suspect McGwire will soon have some form of a press availability where he takes questions. He won’t be able to completely turn the page until he satisfies the pent-up demand and takes some questions.”

The McGwire interview was a coup for the year-old MLB Network and justifies what the channel is paying Costas. It provided McGwire with a stage for acceptance on a channel that is majority-owned by the league that has, after a long goodbye, welcomed him back to his old team. MLB has a little more than half the subscribers ESPN has. But MLB had an edge in Costas if, indeed, McGwire wanted to be interviewed at length by a smart interrogator.

Before he sat down to talk to McGwire, Costas said in a telephone interview, “Yes, they decided this was the place for Mark to tell the story, but not because it was the place where they’d get the easiest ride.”

Costas said he talked to Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa last year about interviewing McGwire.

“I said to Tony that if Mark hopes to be able to proceed from opening day on, he has to address this forthrightly, to answer all legitimate questions and all secondary ones,” Costas said.

Tony Petitti, the president of the MLB Network, said that although talks with McGwire’s camp made it clear that McGwire was going to say something significant, he and Costas did not know until the release of McGwire’s statement exactly what it would be.

“We didn’t see the release ahead of time and we had to react to what he was going to say,” Petitti said.

Whatever it was, the channel was guaranteed the exclusive interview.
330 2010-01-12 Ms. Alexeyeva grew up in a world suffused with whispers. There was muffled weeping when her neighbors were arrested in Stalin’s purges. At 19, she was reported to a Communist party secretary for reciting banned poetry. Soon after she turned 40, she volunteered to type the Chronicle of Current Events, a journal compiled in such secrecy that not even its contributors knew one another’s roles. Once, hauled in for questioning, Ms. Alexeyeva stuffed eight copies of the manuscript into her bra.

Everyone knew the sentence for crimes against the state: seven years in a penal camp and five years in exile. On her way into K.G.B. headquarters, Ms. Alexeyeva would stop to buy a ham sandwich, an éclair and an orange. These were delicacies in the 1970s, even for the investigator, who was headed for a lunch of gray cutlets. Halfway through, Ms. Alexeyeva would unwrap her lunch and lay it out on the table.

“They reacted very nervously when they started to smell ham,” she said with a sweet smile. “Then I would start eating the orange, and the aroma would start dissipating through the room.” The effect was reliably hypnotic.

“That’s how I amused myself,” she said. “It was a way to play on his nerves.”

Her career could have ended with emigration, as many of her colleagues’ did. But in 1993, after 16 years in the United States, Ms. Alexeyeva and her husband moved back to a changed Russia. As chairwoman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, the organization she helped found in 1976, she surveyed a changed landscape. Human rights organizations worked out of offices and published their work on Web sites. What they did was now legal.

New fears have replaced the old ones, though. Ms. Alexeyeva has received death threats, and last year she buried two friends who were killed. Legal risks are unpredictable, too. While Soviet dissidents could strategize to protect themselves — knowing, for example, that prosecutors needed at least two witnesses — their tricks are of no use in a post-Soviet justice system, where cases can be wholly fabricated, she said.

“Now they do what they want,” she said. “There were rules then. They were idiotic rules, but there were rules, and if you knew them you could defend yourself.”

Equally troubling, for some of her peers, is the fact that human rights campaigners still address the same narrow, elite slice of society they did in Soviet times — their argument is simply steamrolled by Mr. Putin’s popularity. Tanya Lokshina, deputy director of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch, said that activists faced the central challenge of “finding the language that is convincing for Russian society.”

“That language would have to be different from the language used by Soviet dissenters,” she said. “In a sense, it is easier, strategy-wise, to be opposed to a full totalitarian regime than it is to try to counter a more sophisticated, strongly authoritarian one. There is some freedom. How do you explain to people what exactly they are lacking?”

Ms. Alexeyeva has heard these arguments, and she rejects them. She casts the democratic rollbacks of the Putin period as the recoil that inevitably follows revolution, not as a catastrophe. As for the notion of outreach to the public, she believes that Russians are passive because they are poor, and that that will not change as long as they remain so.

“They are completely not stupid people; they understand everything,” she said. “They just have no power to act. They have no power to even think about these issues, to analyze them, never mind being active.” She pointed to long-stemmed roses sent by a man she had helped free from prison.

“We don’t need to convince him using any marketing. He understands that I helped him,” she said. “We will keep focusing our strength on this, helping people. That is our marketing.”

That said, there are moments when Ms. Alexeyeva shows a grandmaster’s genius for getting her message out, especially to the West. One was her New Year’s Eve rally, regularly held on the 31st day of the month in homage to the article in the Russian Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of assembly. The last time, everyone was arrested except Ms. Alexeyeva, but this time she was swept up with 50 others onto waiting buses. It did not take long for the police to realize their error: within 40 minutes, one of them opened the doors of the bus and told Ms. Alexeyeva she was free to go. She refused, and by that time photographs were beamed around the world showing a wraithlike woman looking up apparently in terror at an officer in camouflage.

In fact, Ms. Alexeyeva had rather expected to be arrested, so she had ordered a shipment of hot meat pies delivered to her apartment and told the guard to admit her New Year guests. A party was in full swing at 11 p.m., when she arrived home from the police headquarters. Russian leaders would wake up to angry statements from the United States National Security Council, and then from the president of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, who said he was “profoundly and personally touched when I think that this very respectful 82-year-old woman spent the night of New Year’s Eve under Russian arrest.”

A few days later, as she watched snow sift past her window, she retold the story for the hundredth time with evident satisfaction. “If it serves as a lesson to them, I wouldn’t call it a victory, but it would be useful,” she said. “Whether it will serve as a lesson I can’t say, because they study very badly.”
331 2010-01-12 A former Federal Emergency Management Agency employee, Lashonda Booker, and her cousin, Peggy Hilton, are being accused of stealing more than $721,000 in Hurricane Katrina relief money. Ms. Booker, who worked in FEMA’s Biloxi office, is accused of using a government database to get information about storm victims who applied for assistance. Prosecutors say Ms. Hilton used the information to get FEMA to send money to a bank account.
332 2010-01-12 China said that its military intercepted a missile in midflight on Monday in a test of new technology that comes amid heightened tensions over Taiwan. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that “ground-based midcourse missile interception technology” was tested in Chinese territory and had “achieved the expected objective.” China has complained recently about the sale of American weapons to Taiwan, including PAC-3 air defense missiles.
333 2010-01-12 “She looked really happy,” Ms. Perry recalled, “and then she looked really confused.”

Such human touches, of course, are part of the legal strategy Mr. Olson and his law partner on this case, David Boies, who have cast their efforts to overturn Proposition 8 as a seminal civil rights struggle.

“That is exactly why we have courts, why we have the Constitution and why we have the 14th Amendment,” Mr. Olson said in his opening statement, adding that while some groups “may not be the most popular people,” the court still should uphold their rights. “That is why we are here today,” he said.

Supporters of Proposition 8, who were granted legal status to defend the ban in court, were quick to disagree. Their lawyers sharply questioned early witnesses about whether lessons on same-sex marriage belong in elementary school.

“Do you think first- and second-graders should be taught about sex in public schools?” Brian Raum, a lawyer for the defendants, asked Paul T. Katami, who is a plaintiff, as is his partner, Jeffrey J. Zarrillo.

Mr. Katami responded that it depended “on how it’s being taught,” before adding “I do know that children are growing up a lot faster.”

The defendants also showed clips from the campaign for Proposition 8, which passed in 2008 with 52 percent of the vote. Mr. Raum asked Mr. Katami why he found one slogan of the “Yes on 8” campaign — “Protect Your Children” — offensive.

“I have a problem with the verbiage of ‘protect your children’ because it insinuates that they have to protect them from something that’s going to harm them,” Mr. Katami said.

Judge Vaughn R. Walker of Federal District Court, who is hearing the case, repeatedly interrupted the opening statements of Mr. Olson and the lead defense counsel, Charles J. Cooper, admonishing the lawyers to provide hard evidence — not just rhetoric.

Both parried with the judge, with Mr. Olson promising expert testimony showing “the grievous harm” caused to gay men and lesbians not allowed to marry, and Mr. Cooper countering that the defense would show that allowing same-sex marriage would undermine traditional marriage and urging “special regard for this venerable institution.”

With the plaintiffs presenting their case first, much early testimony was sympathetic to the same-sex couples, who brought some humor to what was an often tense courtroom atmosphere.

Ms. Perry, for instance, said that she had tried dating boys when she was growing up in rural Bakersfield, Calif., if only for a chance to “have a date for the prom,” but that she had always known she was a lesbian.

Asked by Mr. Olson if she could change her sexual feelings, Ms. Perry paused, then replied: “I’m 45 years old. I don’t think so.”
334 2010-01-12 Sam Grabush, the hotel’s general manager, said that arriving guests fell into two groups — “people who take a bite immediately, and others who eat them as soon as they get to the room.”

How could he be sure the second group acted so swiftly? Because most guests are attracted to views from the windows in the 46-story building as soon as they get to their rooms, he said, and “they all leave chocolate fingerprints” on the curtains.

James Reichart, Midwest’s director of advertising and brand, is one of the few Midwest employees who remember when the airline started serving cookies. “What I remember most of all,” he said, “was people talking about the aroma. In a closed space like an aircraft cabin, to have something as unexpected as the smell of baking cookies was a real delight for everybody aboard.”

There was never any market research or focus groups about the cookies, Mr. Reichart said, “just the informal testing.”

But Midwest and DoubleTree are clearly on to something.

Erich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of Vivaldi Partners, a consulting firm on brands, said that “when consumers don’t know how to judge the benefits or the differentiation of a product — I don’t know the difference between Midwest and JetBlue and United — then a meaningless attribute like cookies can create meaningful differentiation.”

In a nod to the adage about starting the day with a good breakfast, Midwest does not offer cookies on flights that leave before 10 a.m., though one passenger on a 7:10 a.m. flight out of La Guardia wrote on her blog: “Note to Midwest Airline CEO: It is NEVER too early for cookies. Cookies are an important part of a healthy breakfast.”

And while the benefits to cookie lovers are obvious, the providers probably get their money’s worth, Mr. Joachimsthaler said. The giveaway “creates buzz, it creates differentiation, it increases a purchase decision,” he said.

Although DoubleTree’s cookies are served on the ground and Midwest’s in the air, there are similarities. Both start with frozen cookie dough, made to their particular specifications.

DoubleTree’s cookies are baked several times a day in the kitchen of the hotels’ restaurants, and are kept warm in ovens built into the hotels’ front desks — each oven is about the size of a two-drawer lateral file cabinet.

Midwest does not have to worry about keeping its cookies warm, because after they are partly baked on the ground, they are cooked in the planes’ ovens and served immediately.

“I like it a lot,” Stephan Spencer of Madison, Wis., said of the airborne treats as he left a Midwest flight at La Guardia. “They’re right out of the oven.”

Another Midwest passenger, Maciej Jasinski of Pewaukee, Wis., was more succinct. “It’s good,” he said, adding that he sometimes buys the frozen cookie dough that Midwest sells at some supermarkets in Milwaukee and Kansas City, the airline’s hubs.

DoubleTree sells tins of its cookies online, at www.doubletreecookies.com.

DoubleTree says it serves more than 10 million cookies a year at its more than 200 hotels; Midwest, nearly 10 million.

None of the two companies’ rivals have tried to copy the cookie giveaways. “Everybody in our business knows that the cookie belongs to Midwest Airlines,” Mr. Reichart said. Among hotels, Mr. Wingham said, DoubleTree has “owned this unique amenity for the past 20 years.” Mr. Grabush, the Times Square DoubleTree manager, called it “the signature, the brand.”

Because Midwest’s cookies are served aloft, a side-by-side comparison of just-out-of-the oven ones by a panel of expert tasters is impossible.

Winter Raymond, a front desk agent at the DoubleTree Guest Suites in Boston, who has flown Midwest, says that DoubleTree’s are better, but, of course, she is biased.

A very unscientific taste test, by a panel of one, produced no clear winner, because the cookies are so different. The DoubleTree cookie is huge, which makes it moister inside. The primary ingredient is Ghirardelli chocolate chips. Walnuts are third, right after the flour. Midwest’s cookies, in which the chocolate chips are the third ingredient, are thinner, and thus a little crisper.

Capt. Chris Stork, who flies a Midwest Embraer 170, said the unscientific test was flawed because the Midwest cookie was eaten on the ground. “It’s not the same experience,” he said, with an almost straight face, “because you’re at the earth’s pressure.”
335 2010-01-12 Researchers reported last week that antidepressant drugs seemed to be effective mainly in people with severe depression, not those with milder forms. Now another study is reporting that only about half of all Americans with depression receive treatment of any kind.

Moreover, only 1 in 5 are getting care — talk therapy, medication or both — that conforms to American Psychiatric Association guidelines, according to the study, which appears in the January issue of Archives of General Psychiatry.

The findings were based on nationally representative surveys of 15,762 adults from February 2001 to November 2003.

Over all, more patients used talk therapy (44 percent) than drug therapy (33 percent). Mexican-Americans and African-Americans were less likely than other groups to receive treatment of any kind.

“For minorities especially, psychotherapy may be more acceptable than antidepressants,” said the lead author of the study, Hector M. González, assistant professor of family medicine and public health at Wayne State University in Detroit. “The take-home message is that maybe we should be trying to reach out to these particular minorities more with psychotherapy.”
336 2010-01-12 Almost half of all women who use a popular injected contraceptive lose a significant amount of bone mass within two years, and researchers now say the greatest risk is to smokers, women who don’t consume enough calcium and those who have never gone through a pregnancy.

A study that followed women who used the birth-control method — a shot of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, better known as DMPA or Depo-Provera, every three months — found that 45 percent of the users experienced bone mineral density losses of 5 percent or more in the hip or lower spine, researchers said. The study appears in the January issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

More than two million American women use DMPA, including about 400,000 teenagers.

Researchers said the bone loss was of “significant concern” because recovering bone mass can take a long time, and the hip is the most common site for fractures in women later in life.

“We can now tell our patients, ‘Don’t smoke, and take your calcium every day’ — those are modifiable risk factors,” said the senior author, Dr. Abbey B. Berenson, director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women’s Health at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. “The flip side is that if I have a patient who smokes, I’m going to be more concerned about giving her Depo-Provera.”

363 2010-01-13 Nintendo’s rivals are generally further along in that effort. The Sony PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray disc player and can use Sony’s own online movie store. Microsoft has outfitted the Xbox 360 with its Zune high-definition movie store and allows users to chat online while they watch films together. Both of those consoles already offer the Netflix service.

The Wii has had only minimal video material, but it will take a big step forward in this regard with Netflix, when the Wii adds the service this spring. Wii owners with a broadband Internet connection who have at least a $9-a-month subscription to Netflix’s DVD-by-mail service will be able to use the online service at no additional cost.

But Wii owners will need to receive a free software disc in the mail from Netflix and put it into their console when they want to watch a movie, as on the PS3.

The Wii, unlike the PS3 and Xbox, is not powerful enough to display high-definition streaming video. Some analysts and industry observers expect Nintendo to announce a new Wii HD version of its console next year.

Though it is now more than three years old, the original Wii continues to charm casual gamers with its unique style of game play, which involves physical gestures. Nintendo said it sold three million units in the United States alone over the holidays, outselling both of its rivals, and has sold a total of 26 million in this country.

However, both Sony and Microsoft are expected to add gesture-style game play to their devices over the next year. And the PS3, at least, appears to be slowly gaining ground on the Wii. Sony introduced a slimmed-down version of the PS3 last year and said it sold 3.8 million units worldwide in December, a 76 percent increase over the year before.

By adding Netflix to its service, Nintendo may be making a bid for customers who are considering switching. “Nintendo is saying, look, we are doing all the same stuff. You want to remain connected to us,” said Pelham Smithers, an independent video game analyst.

Reggie Fils-Aime, president of Nintendo of America, said the Wii had always been primarily about bringing video games to the mass market, including people who normally would not play a violent shoot-’em-up or pick up a traditional video game controller.

But, Mr. Fils-Aime said, “from Day 1, we always had other capabilities within the console.” The deal with Netflix, he said, “is a continuation of an effort to bring more and more entertainment to consumers who interact with the Wii.”

The deal gives Netflix a prominent hat trick in the video game console market and underscores its recent emphasis on its digital streaming business. The company, based in Los Gatos, Calif., now has more than 11 million subscribers to its traditional DVD-by-mail business. But more of those people are also watching movies and shows online: more than 50 percent, up from 20 percent a year and a half ago when Netflix first started adding its streaming service to devices like the Xbox.

“Our growth in the last two years has been propelled in large part by our investments in streaming content and in the streaming platform,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive. “When the Wii application ships, it’s going to really open up a large additional opportunity.”

One part of that opportunity is to expand the somewhat dusty catalog of films available online. Hollywood studios make mostly older movies available for streaming on Netflix: the 1976 version of “Carrie,” for instance, but not the 2002 remake.

Mr. Hastings says the size of the streaming catalog correlates to the size of the checks it can write to Hollywood studios. So as Netflix adds customers — and cuts costs — it can gradually expand the catalog. Analysts say they believe it costs Netflix about 5 cents to stream a movie online, versus 60 cents to mail a disc to and from a customer.

Netflix also hopes that the accessibility of its online service on devices like the Wii will encourage subscribers to stick around, helping it cut down on marketing expenses. Terms of the Nintendo deal were not disclosed.

As its digital service expands, Netflix subscribers who want to ditch, say, an expensive $25-a-month plan, which allows them to keep four DVDs at a time, may be more easily persuaded to cut back to a cheaper plan instead of canceling outright.

“Netflix is hoping more people will sample the streaming service and like it, and that it will ultimately limit churn,” said John Blackledge, a senior analyst at Credit Suisse.

Analysts have been expecting a deal between Netflix and Nintendo for some time. Mr. Hastings said the Wii’s unusual interface, as well as the specifications of its hardware, created technical challenges to getting the service to work properly.

“The other platforms have a pretty consistent and well-known paradigm, but the Wii is unique,” he said. “All of those things have taken a long time of experimentation and refinement.”
364 2010-01-13 An early morning accident at the port in Morehead City spilled as much as five gallons of the highly explosive chemical pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, prompting officials to close the port and evacuate the surrounding area. Emergency officials made progress containing the spill, and by evening the evacuation was lifted. The accident occurred when a forklift operator punctured a container, putting holes in nine 110-pound drums containing PETN, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
365 2010-01-13 For the second time in a week, the Federal Reserve was accused by a member of Congress on Tuesday of blocking the public release of information about the bailout of the American International Group.

In response to the accusation by Representative Darrell Issa, the ranking Republican member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the chairman of the committee said that he would subpoena the New York Fed for the documents that it did not want released. Those documents were collected last year for a government audit of how $30 billion of taxpayer money wound up with A.I.G.’s trading partners.

Last week, e-mail messages emerged showing how the New York Fed had recommended that A.I.G. not disclose certain information in regulatory filings. The Fed has said it had valid reasons and merely deleted irrelevant information. It said the New York Fed president at the time, Timothy F. Geithner, was not involved.

The Treasury and the New York Fed maintain that Mr. Geithner, now the Treasury secretary, had recused himself from Fed decisions in November and December of 2008, when the payments went to A.I.G.’s trading partners.

His logs, however, show that he met three times that December with Suzanne Nora Johnson, a director of A.I.G. who had been a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, one of the trading partners to get billions of dollars.
366 2010-01-13 WASHINGTON — President Obama has decided to seek a tax on big banks to recoup up to $120 billion that the government expects to lose from bailing out the financial system, automakers and some troubled homeowners.

Mr. Obama will announce the bank fee on Thursday, and it is intended to be temporary but would probably last for several years, a senior administration official said late Tuesday.

Advisers earlier in the week had said that a number of options, including the tax on banks, were under consideration.

“As the banking industry recovered the president and the economic team felt it was important to discuss ways to recoup every dime for the American people more quickly than the law required,” the official said.

The law that created the $700 billion financial rescue effort in 2008 mandated that the White House try to recover any losses by 2013.

The proposal will be part of the budget that Mr. Obama sends to Congress in February. By promoting the idea now, the administration is trying to respond to rising resentment of Wall Street, which is poised to award big bonuses to top employees, even as unemployment remains high.

Thursday will be the second day of the opening hearings of a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which Congress has charged with reporting on the roots of the banking system’s near-collapse. Executives of the nation’s four largest banks are testifying on Wednesday.
367 2010-01-13 His unusual résumé, with experience on both sides of a book contract, gave him a keen sense of a book’s value, both literary and financial. For that reason, as an agent he attracted clients who prized his skills as a reader as much as his skills as a negotiator.

“What made him such a great agent is that he was a great editor to begin with,” said Mr. Smith, whom Mr. Burger represented for nearly 40 years, and who in the lean years before “Gorky Park” (which was published in 1981) wrote more than two dozen mostly pseudonymous novels. “He really knew when you could do better.”

During Mr. Burger’s tenure at Collier’s, a short story by Vonnegut, whom he had known slightly when both were at Cornell and who was then working in public relations for General Electric, crossed his desk. He asked for changes, which Vonnegut made, and the story, “Report on the Barnhouse Effect,” appeared in the magazine in February 1950. It was the first published work of fiction for Vonnegut, who recounted the episode decades later in an interview for The Paris Review.

“And let it be put on the record here that Knox Burger, who is about my age, discovered and encouraged more good young writers than any other editor of his time,” Vonnegut added. “I don’t think that’s ever been written down anywhere. It’s a fact known only to writers, and one that could easily vanish, if it isn’t somewhere written down.”

Knox Breckenridge Burger was born in New York City on Nov. 1, 1922, and grew up north of the city in Chappaqua, Pleasantville and other towns in Westchester County. His father, Carl Burger, was an illustrator of children’s books, including “Old Yeller” and “The Incredible Journey.”

Mr. Burger graduated from Cornell, where he edited the campus humor magazine. He served in the Army during World War II, contributing fiction and reporting to Yank, a weekly magazine published by the military for soldiers, sailors and airmen overseas.

Mr. Burger’s first marriage, to Otis Kidwell, a writer and sculptor, ended in divorce. His second wife, Katharine Sprague, who was known as Kitty, died in 2007. Besides his daughter Katherine, who lives in Manhattan and Woodstock, N.Y., he is survived by another daughter, Neall Margaret Ostertag, of Red Hook, N.Y.; two stepsons, Wyatt Sprague, of Glenford, N.Y., and Ethan Sprague, of Manhattan; two granddaughters; and two stepgranddaughters.

At least half a dozen authors, including Mr. Smith and Mr. MacDonald, honored Mr. Burger by dedicating books to him. Vonnegut, who died in 2007, did, too. His dedication of “Welcome to the Monkey House,” a 1968 collection of short stories that included “Report on the Barnhouse Effect,” read:

“To Knox Burger. Ten days older than I am. He has been a very good father to me.”
368 2010-01-13 WICHITA, Kan. — It remained uncertain on Tuesday whether an abortion opponent accused of murdering a nationally known abortion provider would be permitted to argue that the shooting fell short of first-degree murder because he was trying to save lives.

In a hearing here, Judge Warren Wilbert of Sedgwick County District Court refused a prosecution request to bar the defendant, Scott Roeder, from presenting evidence that might support a voluntary manslaughter conviction. But the judge did not promise to allow such evidence, stating instead that he would make such decisions on a “witness by witness” basis as the trial, set to begin on Wednesday, goes along.

Under state law, “an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force” can constitute voluntary manslaughter.

The question has drawn intense attention from advocates on each side of the abortion debate. Abortion rights advocates say allowing such a defense, which could lead to a sentence far short of the life prison term that first-degree murder can carry, could jeopardize the safety of abortion providers everywhere.

A contingent of abortion opponents who contend that violence can be justified if it stops abortions says the case could mark a shift in the way the public thinks about abortion if Mr. Roeder is allowed to present such a defense.

Mr. Roeder has admitted in court documents to shooting Dr. George R. Tiller, who performed abortions as late as the third trimester of pregnancy, as Dr. Tiller served as an usher at a Sunday service in his church last May.
369 2010-01-13 “Nowhere in New York right now is the fetish for pork fat and dairy flavor more on display,” Sam Sifton writes, then at the Breslin where “April Bloomfield, the chef and an owner, is exhausting gall bladders daily.” If the thought of shredded lamb, breaded and fried; or a soft-boiled Scotch egg, the orb caked in sausage meat, then breaded and fried; or deep-fried stuffed pig’s foot, “the size of a toddler’s leg,” makes your mouth water, then this is your spot. The vaguely British barroom, off the lobby of the Ace Hotel, attracts a “bedlam of gastrotourists and scenemakers.” But a visit should not be taken lightly, with an offering of “10 colors of fat,” “excess can become wretched, and fast.” Thankfully, at least for your body’s sake, the restaurant doesn’t take reservations.
370 2010-01-13 FLORHAM PARK, N.J.  When Mark Sanchez looks at the N.F.L. playoffs, he sees the quarterbacks he once idolized, guys like Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner and Drew Brees.

Of the starting quarterbacks on the eight remaining teams, seven made the playoffs before this season, six have gone to at least one Pro Bowl and three own Super Bowl rings. Then there is Sanchez, the Jets rookie, the youngest and least decorated quarterback in this postseason.

“It’s pretty cool,” Sanchez said of the company he is keeping. “But at the same time, you don’t want to just be there.”

Sanchez wants to win. Same as he wanted to win against New Orleans and Buffalo and New England and Atlanta, four games in which he threw three-quarters of his 20 interceptions, desire trumping good decisions and common sense.

Over the past month, teammates noticed the changes in Sanchez. He seemed more confident and comfortable. He played smarter, within the offense. He grew a beard his parents dislike.

Even on Tuesday, as the Jets neared their divisional playoff game Sunday at San Diego, Sanchez sat at his locker, fiddling with his cellphone, wearing a white karate-style headband, seemingly oblivious to what awaits him.

Last week, Sanchez became the fourth rookie quarterback in N.F.L. history to win a playoff game, after Shaun King (1999), Ben Roethlisberger (2004) and Joe Flacco (2008). Only Flacco won a second game in his first season.

But the Jets believe in Sanchez and think he can match Flacco because of what he has gone through in a strange rookie season.

“Mark, he’s been through it all,” wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery said. “You don’t get that in one year, not what he got. And he withstood it.”

All this before Sanchez played in his first regular-season game: His college coach, Pete Carroll, questioned his decision to turn pro; the Jets’ defense spent training camp confusing him and talking trash; and his coaches gave him the full playbook to digest.

It only raised expectations  and made the struggles seem worse  when Sanchez and the Jets won their first three games. Along the way, Sanchez received criticism for eating a hot dog on the bench in Oakland, for delivering a postgame speech to the news media after a loss to Jacksonville, for failing to apply the advice of Yankees Manager Joe Girardi, who was brought in by the Jets to teach Sanchez how to slide.

His season reads like a failed lie-detector test, squiggly lines running to extremes. There were 23 turnovers, a color-coded system implemented by Coach Rex Ryan, the game Sanchez missed at Tampa Bay because of injury.

After Sanchez became the rare rookie quarterback to win a playoff game, Ryan said what most of Sanchez’s teammates had avoided saying  that Sanchez was sick of feeling like the weak link. Sanchez danced around that theory during his Tuesday news conference, but teammates confirmed he had felt that way at different points this season.

“I know it was tough on him,” tight end Dustin Keller said.

It was clear, especially after the four losses in which Sanchez threw at least three interceptions, how severely he felt he had hurt his team. It was clear in his body language, as the Jets lost six of seven games during the middle of the season.

But like the Jets, Sanchez appears to be playing his best, most mistake-free football at precisely the right time. His teammates, the ones who rode the seesaw with him, will choose to remember his last game as opposed to ones that came before it. Because the experiences in those 16 games, the same number he started in college at Southern California, led to the playoff victory, they reason.

“A rookie quarterback wins a playoff game,” wide receiver Wallace Wright said. “That means something. We proved that we belong. He proved that he belonged.”

Teammates say Sanchez’s progress started when he missed the Buccaneers game, which allowed the backup Kellen Clemens to orchestrate a victory by minimizing mistakes, imparting a lesson to Sanchez without a word. The Jets continued to run the ball from there. They incorporated running back Shonn Greene more into the offense.

Instead of one final pounding of the nail, Sanchez’s improvement was more like a screw turning  gradual  and when the Jets needed him to throw last weekend against the Bengals, he passed effectively. His 80 percent completion rate set a Jets postseason record.

“I really love his presence in the huddle now,” Ryan said. “He doesn’t have to put it all on his shoulders, and that’s why you see the success.”

The injured running back Leon Washington said he sought out Sanchez last week. Instead of instructing Sanchez not to mess up, Washington said he told him to cherish the moment.

Green Bay cornerback Charles Woodson won the Associated Press N.F.L. Defensive Player of the Year award. Woodson received 28 votes from a nationwide panel of 50 sportswriters and broadcasters who cover the N.F.L., double the number of votes for Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis.
371 2010-01-13 Among the films Eric Rohmer directed in the ninth and last decade of his life were “The Lady and the Duke,” set in the embattled aristocracy of 18th-century France, and “The Romance of Astrea and Celadon,” based on a 17th-century French literary pastoral. These were not Mr. Rohmer’s only forays into the past  in the mid-’70s he made “Perceval” and “The Marquise of O ...”  but period dress was hardly this filmmaker’s habitual get-up.

Rather, the name (or the pseudonym) Eric Rohmer conjures a particular tableau of modern Europe, in which generally well-clothed (and occasionally unclothed), nicely spoken men and women converse in picturesque settings, reflecting calmly on the unruly desires to which they cannot help falling prey. His interest always gravitated toward the sexual mores and intellectual preoccupations of the present. And while some aspects of late-20th-century life  most notably, politics  were absent from his palette, he was also free of nostalgia or grandiosity. Meals, conversations, love affairs, excursions to the countryside and trips to the beach: his zest for observing such happenings was inexhaustible.

Still, those two late explorations of an older world don’t seem anomalous when set against earlier, better-known films like “Claire’s Knee” (1970) and “My Night at Maud’s” (1969). Instead, the characters and situations in “The Lady and the Duke” (2001) and “The Romance of Astrea and Celadon” (2007), borrowed from literature and history, appear quintessentially Rohmerian and unmistakably contemporary. Not because the nobles and shepherds who populate the films strike us as anachronistically modern, but rather because most of Mr. Rohmer’s other films can be described as classical.

His principal subject was passion, which he explored in various configurations. Mr. Rohmer, who died on Monday at 89, was interested in triangles, but also in more complicated geometrical patterns. In “Boyfriends and Girlfriends” (1987), “La Collectionneuse” (1967) and “Pauline at the Beach” (1983), desire ricochets between and within various pairings.

Even relatively simple scenarios  an accidental glance at a girl’s leg in “Claire’s Knee,” the more-or-less conventional adultery of “Chloe in the Afternoon” (1972)  yield reversals and paradoxes that defy easy summary. But even at their most feverish and fraught, these situations are diagramed with precision and detachment. Passion may be the subject, but the method is reason.

In an earlier era Mr. Rohmer might have been an exemplary man of letters. And he was, in the first phase of his career, a novelist, a critic and a scholar. But when he embraced cinema, which he saw as the pre-eminent art form of the time, he did so very much in the literary spirit of the 17th and 18th centuries, insisting it was fully compatible with both the medium and the age.

“Believe it or not,” he once wrote, “Diderot is a more modern scriptwriter than Faulkner is.” In the same essay Mr. Rohmer  or rather, Maurice Schérer, as he was then known  declared that “The classical age of cinema is not behind us, but ahead.” The strongest evidence for this contention would turn out to be his own oeuvre.

Mr. Rohmer made his prophecy in 1949, when the French embrace of American novelists and Hollywood filmmakers was at its most ardent. Along with other young polemicists at the journal Cahiers du Cinéma, he championed Nicholas Ray, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks, helping to establish a canon of film history and to lay the groundwork for the art form’s next phase. In the late 1950s Mr. Rohmer’s colleagues went from theory to practice, turning Cahiers du Cinéma’s axioms and arguments into a movement identified (though not by them) as the New Wave.

It is worth pausing to marvel at just how many of them are still around, and still producing work that upholds a tradition of iconoclasm. Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette, Alain Resnais  all are figures in French cinema’s present as well as in its past.

Mr. Rohmer was the oldest of the group and something of a late bloomer as a filmmaker, hitting his stride with “The Moral Tales,” a cycle of six films (two shorts and four features) that began with “The Bakery Girl of Monceau” in 1962 and concluded with “Chloe in the Afternoon” 10 years later.

“The Moral Tales” and the cycles that followed  the six “Comedies and Proverbs” in the 1980s and the “Tales of the Four Seasons” in the 1990s  are the essential Rohmer. Other filmmakers manufacture sequels or burrow repeatedly into genres. His cycles are unusual in the way that they arrange self-contained narratives around themes, ideas and suggestive anecdotes. They don’t make arguments so much as offer slightly different views of similar problems. What happens when we fall in or out of love? How do accidental occurrences impinge on our plans and ambitions? What happens next?

These are not necessarily timeless questions, at least not in the way that fundamental problems of philosophy are. But they are always part of life, and framing them  in language and in pictures, the constituent elements of Mr. Rohmer’s movies (he rarely used music)  is what art does. Classicism is an approach that takes up these problems as they occur, without worrying too much about their contemporary relevance or their permanence. The cynical lovers in “La Collectionneuse” or their innocent counterparts in “Boyfriends and Girlfriends” are who and where they are, which is to say in French movies, but they would also be recognizable in 18th-century paintings or 17th-century plays, in England or Greece or Arcadia.

So Mr. Rohmer’s movies are unlikely to grow old. Future viewers seeking information about France in the 1960s will have to look elsewhere, to Mr. Godard, for example, who caught the spirit of the age. Social turmoil, sexual anxiety, changes in fashion and popular culture: these are all but invisible in Mr. Rohmer’s compositions, even as his words and images arise naturally from his milieu.

“Art is a reflection of our time,” he mused in 1949, when his own period of creativity still lay ahead of him. “But isn’t it also an antidote?”
372 2010-01-13 Three generations share the same philosophy. Ryan’s grandfather took his children skiing or sailing every weekend, lived for 15 years on a boat in the Bahamas and imparted the family code.

“Life isn’t about multiplication tables,” Cary St. Onge, Ryan’s father, said. “School is important, but it’s a tool. It’s not life. I tried to raise him to see what life was.”

In typical St. Onge fashion, Cary and his former wife, Sara, removed Ryan and his older brother, Chad, from school, leased their home and set sail for the Caribbean on a 42-foot boat named Elvin. Ryan was 8 years old; Chad was 10.

Every day was different. The boys learned to scuba dive and spear fish. They visited third world nations and finished their homework at sea. They took turns standing watch, alternating with their parents, day and night.

By the end of the voyage, each family member could have sailed the boat across an ocean. In fact, the boys completed several passages on their own, their parents watching as they hauled anchor, charted course, sailed the boat and anchored it.

The trip exposed them to different cultures, other ways of thinking. It made them stronger, more independent. Ryan St. Onge returned to school with long blond hair turned almost white and the darkest tan his classmates had seen.

“It completely changed who we were,” he said. “I can’t put my finger on exactly what happened, but it’s a huge part of who I am. I don’t ever want to live a normal life.”

In typical St. Onge fashion, Cary and Sara later sailed for seven years in a 60-foot boat named Sunshine. They flew to Italy from Thailand to watch Ryan compete in the Olympics. He met them all over the world.

In the Marquesas Islands, he encountered bugs the size of his fist. In Tonga, he rode a ferry with squealing pigs and boxes of livestock. In Sri Lanka, where Cary and Ryan stopped after a typhoon tore up their boat, they bought repair parts in a war zone, then took a photograph with guards holding AK-47s.

The St. Onges said “normal” people never understood how parents could send two children, ages 13 and 15, on a weeklong trip to Finland for the freestyle skiing junior world championships.

In 10th grade, Ryan’s principal told his parents that if he missed two more days, he would fail all of his classes, under school policy. The principal asked Cary if he valued education. Cary answered yes. The principal wondered how many more days Ryan would miss. Cary answered 82. The principal walked out, and Ryan took correspondence courses.

“It’s frustrating for those who try to live by the rules,” Cary said. “That’s the conflict. Yeah, sailing around the world is a crazy thing to do. So is spending your life jumping off a 15-foot ramp and calling it your job.”

In typical St. Onge fashion, Ryan took to freestyle skiing, same as the rest of the family, including Dad, who also worked as a coach and an official. Ryan’s life experiences provided the perfect mind-set, free of convention, uninterested in results but obsessed with the science and artistry involved.

On the mountain, he plays the role of rocket, skiing into the jump at 40 miles per hour, the 70-degree angle shooting his body upward as he resists gravity with a series of flips and twists, like Cirque du Soleil on snow.

“And there’s this period where you think maybe, just maybe, I’m not going to come back down,” he said. “You’re coming off the jump and floating through the sky, this weightless feeling unlike anything else. Like you could hang up there forever.”

At 14, Ryan made the national team, the youngest member ever at the time. By 2006, inconsistent results, finishes near the top or the bottom, forced him to start over.

He reunited with Todd Ossian, a coach of world renown, and they developed a four-year plan that Ossian compared to Tiger Woods revamping his golf swing. They worked on takeoff, twisting mechanics and twist timing. They incorporated video and physics and developed their own freestyle language.

But after two years of mostly disappointing results, St. Onge said the national team had started to lose faith in him. He went to Lake Placid, N.Y., to work with another coach, Dmitriy Kavunov, and they carried out the remainder of the plan. Most aerialists attempted 500 practice jumps each summer; St. Onge did 3,000, five summers in a row.

Last season, that work culminated in a breakthrough. St. Onge won at the world championships in Japan, the first men’s aerials gold medal for an American since 1999, and he finished the season ranked second in the world.

In typical St. Onge fashion, the night he won gold, he skied down the nearby practice ramp into icy water, wearing only a kimono and his ski gear.

Soon, he hopes the four-year plan will culminate in another Olympics. St. Onge must qualify based on coming World Cup placings.

Before resuming training, he headed to Winter Park, the ski resort in Colorado that he calls home. There, he heard the familiar crunch of ski boots, saw the coaches who first trained him and spent an hour signing autographs.

St. Onge has not yet planned for after the Olympics, but he has an idea of what retirement will look like. He joked about stealing his father’s boat, an 80-footer, and sailing to Vanuatu, a group of islands in the South Pacific where the people farm and fish and seemed happier than anyone he ever met.

Sometimes, St. Onge thinks about generational learning habits, about his grandfather and his father and now him, each generation more free spirited than the next.

“Maybe I’ll take it to the next level,” he said. “Maybe my kids will rebel and join corporate America.”

But for now, the St. Onges remain concerned with the Olympics, with their philosophy, with the next rocket launch. In typical St. Onge fashion, next year, they may use liquid nitrogen.
373 2010-01-13 Among the other grantees are the Drawing Center in New York; the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Mo.; the estate of Emilio Cruz in New York; the Delaware Art Museum; and the Orange County Museum of Art in California.

On Monday several of the grantees said they had received a letter of apology from Mr. Miller.

“Unfortunately, in the last quarter of the year I suffered a serious accident and have been unable to finish all of the business pending in 2009, including the cutting and posting of the grant checks,” the letter said. “It is my first priority to send you the monies granted to you from our jury as expeditiously as we are able. You may expect payment in full of the grant award in the first part of this year.”

The letter had a Pennsylvania return address but gave no phone number. On Tuesday Mr. Miller answered the door at that address in suburban Philadelphia — his home — wearing a neck brace. He told a reporter that he had broken his neck in a fall last autumn and spent “at least a month” in the hospital. He added that the 2009 grants would be paid within the next 30 days.

“This is the first time in 15 years we have been late for a payment,” Mr. Miller, 61, said in an interview in his art-filled living room. “These people are getting their checks within the next 30 days. If I have to mortgage this house, I will do it.”

Natalie Edgar, the director of the Philip Pavia Trust in New York, which had been awarded $7,000 toward a book about the works of Mr. Pavia, a sculptor, was one of those who filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office. (The office confirmed that it had received complaints and was reviewing the matter.)

Ms. Edgar wrote in her complaint that she was particularly troubled by the fact that even as the foundation was failing to pay out its grants, the Museum of Modern Art, where Mr. Miller has been a trustee since 2003, presented an exhibition of 354 works from a collection of about 2,500 by 650 artists that was amassed by Mr. Miller on behalf of the foundation from 2003 to 2005. The show, “Compass in Hand: Selections From the Judith Rothschild Foundation Contemporary Drawings Collection,” opened last April and closed on Jan. 4. It was the first public display of the collection, which experts estimated to be worth about $30 million in 2005.

“The logic is simple,” she said in her complaint. “Harvey Shipley Miller had been spending foundation assets on a shopping spree to buy 2,500 drawings of emerging artists — the cost would be in the multimillions of dollars.”

“His shopping spree opposes the guidelines of the foundation,” she added.

Mr. Miller rejected that accusation. “The point of the foundation is to bring the work to a broad public audience,” he said. “They didn’t understand that we were not solely a granting organization.”

“Grants are the least important thing we do,” he added in a later telephone interview.

According to the foundation’s 2007 tax forms, the most recent that are publicly available, it ended that year with $13.8 million in total assets, $9.5 million of which was in art and about $4 million in other property. About $250,000 was in cash or other liquid assets.

In his letter Mr. Miller noted that Elizabeth Slater, the senior vice president for the grants program, was “laid off last spring due to our more limited available financial resources.” Calls to Ms. Slater’s Minneapolis home were unreturned, and e-mail messages to an address she had used in the past got this automated response: “Hello, I am unavailable to read your message at this time.”

On its Web site, the foundation says it “will not be accepting proposals in 2009 for next year’s award cycle.”

“As provided in Judith Rothschild’s will,” it continues, “eligibility required the artist to have died after Sept. 12, 1976, and before March 7, 2008 (15 years before the date of her will and 15 years after her death).” It is not clear when this notice was posted and whether the announcement is related to the foundation’s payout of the 2009 grants.

It goes on: “Because of last year’s closing of the eligibility window, the Judith Rothschild Foundation will spend the upcoming grant cycle evaluating the most effective way to refocus the activities of the Grant Program in order to best support those eligible artists remaining within this now closed pool and to carry out the mission of the foundation in accordance with the terms of Rothschild’s will.”

There is no additional explanation as to why the end of the period stipulated by Ms. Rothschild’s will would prompt such a re-evaluation.

Several of the grantees say the foundation could have preserved good will if it had been up front about what was going on. Anita Shapolsky, who has a gallery in Manhattan and was granted $5,000 for a monograph on the painter Ernest Briggs, said: “I can’t be angry. But if they haven’t got the money, at least they could have said that.”

Mr. Miller said that he was too badly injured to contact the grantees, and that his many years of service should count for something. “I devoted my life to helping arts institutions for free,” he said. “My life has been the arts and helping artists.”
374 2010-01-13 TOKYO — Investors rushed to sell their shares in Japan Airlines on Tuesday and Wednesday ahead of a bankruptcy filing that could come as early as next week. At the same time, two rival airlines, American and Delta, battled for a stake in JAL, which could still be a strong regional player once restructuring takes place.

American Airlines said Tuesday that it had raised its joint offer of an investment in JAL, together with the private equity firm TPG, by $300 million, to $1.4 billion. The United States carrier also pledged a $100 million annual sales increase for JAL if it stayed with the American-led Oneworld airline alliance.

Other members of the Oneworld alliance have weighed in to support American’s bid. British Airways offered an additional $200 million in revenue to JAL over three years through an expanded code-sharing agreement, while Qantas said it would advise JAL on setting up a low-cost carrier business.

Delta Air Lines has offered $500 million in equity, as well as a substantial increase in passengers and revenue from its SkyTeam alliance.

Still, shares in JAL, which has $16 billion in liabilities, fell 45 percent on Tuesday and then 80 percent more on Wednesday, to 7 yen, as a bankruptcy filing appeared inevitable.
375 2010-01-13 The trade deficit in the United States widened more than expected in November, offering positive signs that American businesses and consumers were growing more confident about spending as the economy slowly improved.

The deficit totaled $36.4 billion in November, up 9.7 percent from October. The chief cause of the bigger trade gap was rising prices on oil imports.

Still, there were indications that spending on other foreign goods was growing: imports of items like computers and software rose 3.8 percent, and industrial supplies rose 5.1 percent.

As the economy recovers, companies appear to be expanding by buying equipment like telephones and electronics. At the same time, Americans are spending more on foreign-made goods like toys and cosmetics.

“We’re not back yet to what I would call a fully functioning economy, but we are heading in the right direction,” said Robert A. Dye, senior economist PNC Financial Services Group. “There are positive signs of healing for both the United States and global economies.”

Demand for American products overseas, however, was tepid in November, with exports increasing a modest 0.9 percent from October to $138.2 billion. While that was the highest level in a year, the pace slowed from increases of nearly 3 percent in the two months before. Exports of food, cars and semiconductors increased, while aircraft and consumer goods declined.
376 2010-01-13 SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea and the United States said Tuesday that they would discuss a peace treaty with North Korea only after the North returned to six-nation disarmament talks and began dismantling its nuclear weapons program.

The two countries also rejected the North’s demand that United Nations sanctions be lifted before it returns to the talks.

“We’ re not going to pay North Korea for coming back to the six-party-process,” Philip J. Crowley, a State Department spokesman, said in Washington.

On Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry proposed “immediate” talks with the United States to negotiate a peace treaty that would formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, leaving the Korean Peninsula technically in a state of war.

The North said treaty talks could be held separately or be included in the six-nation talks, which include the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. The talks have been in limbo since last spring, when North Korea withdrew to protest sanctions that were imposed after it tested its second nuclear device and some ballistic missiles.

“We can discuss a peace treaty only after the six-party talks are reopened and there is progress in the denuclearization of North Korea,” Defense Minister Kim Tae-young of South Korea said at a news conference on Tuesday. “North Korea has a history of offering peace gestures with one hand while committing provocations with the other.”

404 2010-01-14 Many predictions made by critics during the debate surrounding the takeover of Inco and other prominent Canadian resource companies like Alcan, the large aluminum producer based in Montreal, have not come to pass in Sudbury, which literally grew around Inco’s nickel operations during the 19th century.

John Rodriguez, the mayor and a strong supporter of the strike, acknowledged that Vale had not reduced charitable donations. The company pressed ahead with significant investments in Sudbury’s mines and smelters planned by Inco. And it even won favor with many locals by planting grass on some of the black slag heaps that make vast sections of the otherwise attractive city resemble the surface of a barren planet.

But Jean-Charles Cachon, a management professor at Laurentian University in Sudbury, said that he had observed one significant change since Vale took control of Inco — a reluctance to share information about its books.

After a particularly bitter series of strikes, Inco took a new approach beginning in 1985. Professor Cachon and Mr. Fera said that the company began sharing internal accounts with the union, a move that averted at least one strike. Similarly, Inco opened its books to suppliers. Not long after Vale’s acquisition, however, Professor Cachon said that “they reverted back to what I would call the old-fashioned Inco way. That is: ‘We don’t tell anyone anything.’ ”

Mr. Fera said that the union not only lost its dialogue with the company, it also noticed an increase in disciplinary actions against its members. The two factors, Mr. Fera said, combined to create a tense environment when negotiations began in the spring of 2009. Early last year, Vale Inco announced that it would extend a previously scheduled one-month shutdown of its Canadian nickel operations for two more months, a move that left up to 5,000 employees on temporary layoff beginning in May.

The company cited growing nickel inventories and low nickel prices. After peaking at about $20 a pound in 2007, a year after Vale paid $19.4 billion for Inco in a heavily leveraged deal, nickel had fallen to about $7 a pound. It is trading for about $8 a pound now.

On Wednesday, the union filed a formal complaint against Vale Inco accusing the company of bargaining in bad faith. It asks the Ontario Labor Relations Board to order contract talks restarted under a mediator and to require that the company present new proposals on key issues. It also requests that Vale Inco be required to reimburse the strikers for lost wages.

“The bargaining-in-bad-faith claim is baseless,” Cory McPhee, a Vale Inco spokesman based in Toronto, wrote in an e-mail message. He added that the company had approached the steelworkers “on numerous occasions asking them to sit down with us and explore a path forward. They’ve rejected the idea at every turn.”

Two demands from Vale Inco are, in the union’s view, responsible for the ultimate collapse of the talks. Like some other employers in Canada, the company wants to change its pension plan from one offering guaranteed benefits — the dominant model for many large Canadian plans — to a defined-contribution plan with variable benefits.

Arguably more provocative is Vale Inco’s proposal to modify a profit-sharing plan linked to the price of nickel. Before the current recession, when high demand for stainless steel brought high nickel prices, miners at Inco earned 20 Canadian dollars an hour through the nickel bonus. When nickel prices were low, however, the bonus payments have amounted to as little as 500 Canadian dollars a year. If the miners were working now, the bonus payment would be about 6 Canadian dollars an hour.

Vale Inco wants to raise the minimum nickel price that initiates the bonus — an idea the union accepts, although the two sides disagree on the amount — and set a limit on the maximum payment, which the steelworkers reject.

Mr. McPhee, a longtime Inco employee himself, dismissed union suggestions that the strike was a clash between Brazilian and Canadian business cultures. Instead, he criticized the union for holding what he considered an unrealistic view of Vale Inco’s situation.

“We did not want to be in a strike, but the business has fundamentally changed,” Mr. McPhee said. “We’re in a 100-year-old-plus operation here. It brings challenges in terms of investment in the business.”

Out at the picket line near the Vale Inco Copper Cliff smelter — its 1,234-foot smokestack is something of a national landmark — most of the strikers viewed the situation as a power play by the their new Brazilian owners.

“The other owner, you knew where they were coming from,” said Chris Schroer, a millwright. “These ones just want to show us that they’re the boss.”

The union, however, is not without an international dimension itself. To start with, Mr. Fera’s local is part of an international union based in Washington. Its president, Leo W. Gerard, is a former Inco employee and member of the local Mr. Fera now heads. And throughout the strike, the steelworkers have been working with unions in Brazil and Europe to organize anti-Vale protests and to press other companies not to buy copper concentrate from Sudbury.

While the union’s continental membership has allowed it to endure a long strike financially, Vale’s global nature has also given it a similar advantage. In the past, a shutdown in Sudbury as well as the smaller Vale Inco mine in Labrador in the province of Newfoundland, where 150 to 170 workers also remain on strike, would have virtually eliminated the majority of the old Inco’s revenue. At Vale Inco, by contrast, nickel is only 15 percent of the business.

Professor Cachon views the strike as being more of a clash between mining cultures than one pitting Brazilian values against those of Canadians.

Vale’s iron ore business is based around open-pit mines staffed with large numbers of relatively low-skilled workers. In deep rock mines like Sudbury’s, most low-skilled labor has been replaced by sophisticated machinery. The miners, while well paid, are mainly technicians with several years of training and apprenticeship behind them.

“These people are already trying to find employment elsewhere and won’t be interested in coming back unless they have very good working conditions,” Professor Cachon said. “You just can’t replace people like that.”
405 2010-01-14 The Mets said Beltran was expected to resume baseball-related activities in 12 weeks — or April 7, when the Mets are scheduled to host the Florida Marlins in the second game of the regular season — but made no mention of when he could be reasonably expected to rejoin the lineup.

Several times last season the Mets offered projections on the return dates of players like Jose Reyes, Carlos Delgado and Oliver Perez, only to be disappointed. Beltran would have to work himself into game shape and begin a rehabilitation assignment, making it unlikely that he would return before May.

His absence in 2009 contributed to a disastrous season in which the Mets went 70-92 and were criticized for how they handled their injured players, specifically Reyes, who missed the final four and a half months with a torn hamstring tendon. Other starters like Johan Santana, Delgado and Perez also missed significant time because of injury. The Mets were hoping to put that behind them, but they are back where they started, facing questions.

This is the second medical issue to erupt in the off-season for the Mets. In October, the Dodgers took umbrage with an inference made by Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer, that they had misdiagnosed Reyes’s original injury when the Mets played in Los Angeles in May.

As for Beltran, the Mets said that he had not been feeling pain in his knee during the off-season and as he began his conditioning program, but that his osteoarthritis started to worsen and his knee became painful.

Beltran’s knee had bothered him for about a month before the Mets placed him on the disabled list June 22, when a magnetic resonance imaging exam showed that the bruise that was causing him problems had doubled in size.

On advice from his agent, Scott Boras, Beltran met with Steadman in Vail, Colo., on June 29 for a second opinion. Steadman pioneered microfracture surgery, a procedure often performed on the knees of professional athletes which regenerates damaged cartilage. (It is not known whether Beltran’s surgery Wednesday was a microfracture procedure.)

The consultation confirmed that Beltran had only a bone bruise in his knee and that he did not require surgery of any nature. In 2007, Beltran, bothered by tendinitis in his knees for most of the season, had arthroscopic surgery to clean out frayed tissue from the patellar tendon.

As the Mets’ season dissolved, Beltran was adamant that he would play again — for peace of mind and, in the words of Manager Jerry Manuel, to at least answer that question heading into spring training. He came back on Sept. 8 and played 19 games, batting .284, and repeatedly played down the possibility that he would need off-season surgery — even though the bone bruise was still there.

In the meantime, the Mets must plan for another opening day center fielder. Angel Pagan performed capably in Beltran’s absence last season and would figure to be the best candidate unless General Manager Omar Minaya makes any moves before spring training.

The Mets introduced the Japanese reliever Ryota Igarashi, who was given No. 18. ... There has been movement on the stalled negotiations between the Mets and the free-agent catcher Bengie Molina. Molina originally wanted a three-year deal, and the Mets were offering one year and an option.
406 2010-01-14 LOS ANGELES — A lawyer for the New Age guru who led a sweat lodge ceremony in Arizona that left three people dead said Wednesday that the deaths were a “tragedy” and an “accident,” but should not be considered a crime.

In letters last month and last week to prosecutors, the lawyer for the guru, James A. Ray, who led the Oct. 8 ceremony at the Angel Valley Spiritual Retreat Center in Sedona, Ariz., sought to erase perceptions that Mr. Ray had stopped people from leaving and had sat by while people died.

“Mr. Ray and his team relied on Angel Valley to provide a safe environment, warned people of the risks, did not force people to participate, did not prevent them from leaving, and did everything they could to prepare for any problems and to assist when problems arose,” the lawyer, Luis Li, and two colleagues wrote in the Jan. 4 letter.

The letter added, “The idea perpetrated by the media that Mr. Ray was somehow intentionally callous about the victims of this tragedy is profoundly wrong and hurtful.”

The “spiritual warrior” retreat led by Mr. Ray included a two-hour sweat lodge ceremony during which hot rocks were placed inside a tent to produce a sweltering environment intended to cleanse or renew the soul. Of the 55 people inside, 3 died, and 20 others were treated for heat-related injuries.
407 2010-01-14 The television shows “True Blood,” “Glee” and “Mad Men,” and films “I Love You, Man” and “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” are among the nominees for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation’s annual GLAAD Media Awards, the group announced on Wednesday. The awards recognize and honor “media for outstanding images” of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The alliance said the winners would be chosen from 116 nominees in 24 English-language categories and 36 nominees in eight Spanish-language categories. “Precious” and “I Love You, Man” were among the five nominees in the outstanding film (wide release) category; “True Blood” and “Mad Men” were nominated for outstanding drama series, along with “Brothers & Sisters,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Skins”; “Glee” (cast members pictured above) was nominated for outstanding comedy series, as were “Modern Family,” “United States of Tara,” “Beautiful People” and “Greek.”
408 2010-01-14 Many of the playwrights see the nation’s major nonprofit theater companies as impediments to their work, favoring plays that have few characters to save money on actors’ salaries, for instance, or that have themes appealing to large audiences. Playwrights say artistic directors are obsessed with selling tickets in spite of their nonprofit missions and with pleasing board members by favoring world premieres or playwrights who are already admired by critics.

“We heard from artistic directors who admitted that they’re all going after the same 10 playwrights to produce their work, which is largely about getting prestige in their field,” said Todd London, the chief author of the study and book, “Outrageous Fortune: The Life and Times of the New American Play.” Mr. London, the artistic director of New Dramatists, a group that helps playwrights, declined to name those artistic directors or playwrights.

Theater leaders and artistic directors, meanwhile, are frustrated by the lack of private and government money available to produce new plays and feel under pressure to balance budgets just to survive, according to the study. These executives also tend to view playwrights as insufficiently savvy about the cold realities of the business and say playwrights harbor misperceptions — that executives are less concerned with audience reaction or controversial subject matter than playwrights assume, for instance.

Victoria Bailey, executive director of the Theater Development Fund, which provides financial support to artists and theaters and runs the TKTS discount booths in New York, said the study showed that “the relationship between playwrights and theaters is essentially broken, and it needs to be fixed to improve the environment for exciting new theater.”

Ms. Bailey said that more theaters and playwrights needed to develop bonds like that between Steppenwolf and Mr. Letts, who is also a longtime member of that ensemble, and that theaters can take the first step by better explaining both their artistic visions and financial pressures to playwrights.

The playwrights know something about financial pressures. The study found that most of them cannot afford to live on their plays alone. According to the study, the average playwright earns $25,000 to $39,000 annually, with about 62 percent of playwrights making less than $40,000 and nearly a third pulling in less than $25,000.

David Adjmi, an award-winning playwright whose drama “Stunning” was produced Off Broadway last summer by Lincoln Center Theater’s program for emerging writers, said he earned as much as $40,000 from his plays in some years and as little as $5,000 in others. Mr. Adjmi said he had never had health insurance and lived with his mother in Midwood, Brooklyn, for a time in his early 30s to save money.

“I was unable to write plays for two and a half years because I was temping to pay my rent, and money that I did make from playwriting went to fill a bunch of cavities that I’d let build up,” Mr. Adjmi said.

“The reality that the study paints is true for many of us,” he continued. “I think that when theaters think about risk taking, they think about it in terms of financial risk. Does this play not have a star in the cast? That’s a risk. Is this a relatively unknown playwright? That’s a risk. There’s just a tremendous amount of cynicism and mistrust between playwrights and theaters right now.”

Some notable voices have criticized the study, however, saying that playwrights appear self-serving in some sections. They note that Mr. London has argued in the past for empowering artistic directors, so that they become influential patrons of new plays, yet now his study seems to be suggesting that artistic directors have disenfranchised playwrights.

In an online commentary that has drawn attention Chris Jones, the theater critic for The Chicago Tribune, described the playwrights as whiners and quick to make faulty assumptions about theaters and audiences. He argued too that “good plays deserve encouragement,” that “audiences need protection from bad ones,” and that playwrights know this “as long as we are not talking about their play.”

Mr. London said in an interview that what’s needed are both strong artistic directors and playwrights who are nurtured by theaters. Ms. Bailey said good plays often only developed through multiple readings and productions in which playwrights could make improvements based on feedback from actors and audiences.

“I realize that, yes, there seems to be a lot of whining going on, but we need to pull back from the whining and look at the disconnects between artists and theaters,” said Ms. Bailey, who traveled to Chicago and Minneapolis with Mr. London this week to begin discussing the findings of the study with theater leaders and playwrights nationally.

For some artistic directors the study reflects their own concerns about the state of nonprofit American theater in the last few decades of reduced government and foundation spending on the arts, which put more pressure on theaters to raise money and, in some cases, select plays that would be box-office draws. New work appears to have been a casualty. The average number of new plays on Broadway annually, for instance, fell to 14 between 1980 and 2000, from 29 between 1960 and 1980, according to the study. (The number was 130 between 1920 and 1940.)

Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, said the economics of theater today “has exerted a profoundly conservative influence on all of our not-for-profit theaters.” He argued that in this environment theaters with sizable budgets owed it to playwrights to make an extra effort to support them by creating master-writer chairs that provide a salary, pension and health benefits. The Public has one, now held by Suzan-Lori Parks.

At the same time, he said, playwrights need to understand that theaters have serious business concerns that limit their ability to favor playwrights over audiences.

“There is always room for artistic risk taking and experimental theater, but if we’re going to have a theater that matters, we have to make theater that people want to see,” Mr. Eustis said. “If as a field we resent that criterion, we’ll doom the field to oblivion.”
409 2010-01-14 LOS ANGELES — The offstage turmoil around “American Idol” continues to grow as Simon Fuller, chief executive of 19 Entertainment and the creator of “American Idol,” is expected to announce soon that he is starting a new company to pursue film and other entertainment projects separately from 19 Entertainment and its publicly traded parent, CKX.

The move could raise questions about the growth prospects for CKX, which bought 19 Entertainment in March 2005. CKX’s revenue and profit declined in the first nine months of last year as ratings for “American Idol” fell for the third consecutive year and as the national recession took a toll on sponsorship deals for the program.

In an interview, Mr. Fuller said he expected to be fully involved with “American Idol” as long as that program was on television but that he wanted to expand his horizons. “I want to build a new company and do great things,” he said. “I don’t want to run somebody else’s company.”

Robert F. X. Sillerman, the chairman and chief executive at CKX, said in an interview that CKX had the right to invest in Mr. Fuller’s new venture, which would “relieve Simon of the pressures of managing a large enterprise and let him focus his energy on creating things,” including film projects that could involve CKX’s rights to the Elvis Presley estate.

Over all, 19 Entertainment, whose assets also include “So You Think You Can Dance” and “Superstars of Dance,” accounted for more than three-quarters of CKX’s revenue and operating profit in the first nine months of last year. At the time of the 2005 sale, Mr. Fuller entered into a five-year noncompete agreement with CKX.

Mr. Fuller said that “the relationship between me and 19 is going to be very close” and that he believed that the new venture would complement 19 Entertainment’s business. He drew a parallel between the announcement this week by Fox that in 2011 it would begin producing “The X Factor,” a new talent competition created by Simon Cowell, who will leave “Idol” after the current season.

“Just as we think ‘Idol’ will work well alongside ‘X Factor,’ ” Mr. Fuller said, his new company and CKX “will be joined at the hip.”
410 2010-01-14 Among other things, the service gives you a single phone number that will ring through to any of your phones.

More to the point, you can also tell your cellphone to hand off voice mail responsibilities to Google, assuming your carrier is one of the eight networks on Google’s list. (All the big ones are there.)

You just type your phone number onto the Web page, wait for an automated call from Google, then type in a two-digit pass code. After that, you dial another telephone number to confirm. Next, record a voice mail greeting on your PC, and from that point forward, Google will accept voice mail, transcribe it and send it via SMS or by e-mail.

Google relies on its proprietary voice-recognition technology to transcribe your messages, and it is quite accurate. A company spokeswoman said the service was good enough in most cases to let you get the gist of a message, which is fair.

In some situations, it falls short.

I left three messages with the different voice mail-to-text services, and I delivered the messages twice — once without background noise and once with Jimi Hendrix’s “All Along the Watchtower” in the background.

The first message said: “I love you, Rosalita. Tell your dad we’re getting married.” The second was: “We like your business and are prepared to offer you $22.6 million for it, if you return this message by 4:45 Eastern time.”

Within three minutes, Google sent me an e-mail transcription of the message, with an audio file of the recording attached.

That beat the other services by a minute or so, mainly because unlike most competitors, Google never uses humans to help transcribe phrases. That is a reason that Google is free, but it is also a reason that accuracy can sometimes suffer.

With Hendrix in the background, the “business” message was returned as: “We’d like your business and are prepared to offer you 22.6 million for. If you return this message 5. 445 Eastern Time so.”

The “Rosalita” message fared worse: “I love your broza lead. I saw your dad. We’re getting married.”

At least the business deal worked out.

As with PhoneTag, you can always listen to the sound file, which impressively muted the background music and rendered the message clearly. Google also lets you listen to the file from within your e-mail directory. PhoneTag forces you to download the file and open an application to play it, though it says users can change their preferences to hear a message without downloading.

The headline there, though, is that you no longer have to dial into your voice mail. No more listening to the prompts or dialing passwords or watching voice mail pile up.

AT&T’s failure to include this feature on its service was disappointing. And while we are doling out disappointment: AT&T’s service works on all AT&T phones except the iPhone.

Both PhoneTag and AT&T took a minute or so longer to deliver my noisier voice mail, probably because they routed parts of the message to professional transcribers, as they will do when the technology alone cannot fully recognize something.

Still, the results were mixed. PhoneTag’s transcriptions yielded: “(I love you?), (Rosalita?). Dad were getting married.” And: “We like a business and prepared and offer you 22.6 million for it if you return this message by 44:45 Eastern Time.”

AT&T said: “I love you Roselida(?). Just tell you that was [ ...].” And: “We liked your business and are prepared to offer you 22.6 million for it if you return this message by 4:45 E.S.T.”

One notable advantage of PhoneTag’s service is that it can be connected to your landline, in addition to your cellphone. AT&T’s service, at the other end of the spectrum, transcribes the voice mail for a single cellphone only.

Privacy-wary people, meanwhile, might be alarmed at the notion that anyone or anything is transcribing their voice mail. Google says no one can read or hear your message, unless you choose to share it with the company.

Nuance Communications, which provides the transcription service for AT&T, says it maintains strict privacy practices that prevent employees from recording anything while working. PhoneTag says it has similar policies.

PhoneTag also allows users to drop down to a $10 monthly subscription, but for that price it transcribes 40 messages. Beyond that, you pay 35 cents for each voice mail message.

Is it worth it? It probably saves you a minute of time you would have wasted retrieving voice mail the old-fashioned way. Then again, after you have gotten used to bypassing that annoyance, that wasted minute becomes the modern equivalent of listening to a modem connect to the Internet.

Put another way, it is about as stark a difference as marrying Rosalita, or marrying her dad.

Not all users of Android phones like the Droid, the MyTouch 3G and the new Google Nexus One know that the applications in the Android Market are not screened in advance. A case in point: fake banking apps were recently removed from the market after Google discovered they were frauds. Google said no user information was compromised. Still, users should check with their banks before downloading anything that claims to be an official bank app. ... Fans of Peter Max’s artwork can now send an unlimited number of e-cards, choosing from 365 images by the artist. Cards sent with the Peter Max Birthdays app can be personalized, to celebrate more than just birthdays ($5). ... AT&T subscribers can support Haiti relief efforts by texting “haiti” to 90999. A $10 donation will be added to your wireless bill, and AT&T says 100 percent of the donated money will go to the Red Cross. The company said it expected other carriers to follow suit.

435 2010-01-15 “I always considered his work more soulful than influential,” said Philip Gefter, the author of “Photography After Frank” (Aperture, 2009) and a former picture editor for The New York Times. “His pictures are well seen, solid in that Magnum tradition, sexy in their way, and, to use his own term, visually articulate.”

Mr. Stock maintained an interest in photography until the end of his life. He submitted a half-dozen comments to Lens, The Times’s photojournalism blog, including this observation in May about the role of suffering in art:

“The goal for the photographer is to be visually articulate. If the subject is in a suffering circumstance, it is all the more preferable to apply craft to the utmost. Call it art or not, we photographers should always try to pass on our observations with the utmost clarity.”

Dennis Stock was born on July 24, 1928, in New York. He apprenticed under Gjon Mili from 1947 until 1951, when he came to national attention as one of 10 winners in Life magazine’s $15,000 Contest for Young Photographers.

Mr. Stock submitted a picture essay showing displaced Europeans arriving in New York. As a prize winner, he was in very good company, sharing honors with Robert Frank, Elliott Erwitt and Ruth Orkin, among others. At the time, when television was in its infancy, Life was arguably the most important visual showcase in the country.

Mr. Mili thought his student was ready to head out on his own. Magnum agreed. Mr. Stock was taken into the agency and admitted to full partnership in 1954.

“Now that he is gone, I realize that I vastly underestimated the talent of Dennis Stock,” said John G. Morris, former executive editor of Magnum and a former picture editor of The New York Times. “I think it was because he was such a pain in the neck to deal with in the business of Magnum. I used to affectionately call him Dennis the Menace.

“For me his early work was by far his best,” he continued. “Brilliant. His profile in pictures of James Dean, which I sold to Life magazine in 1955, helped put Dean on the movie map despite his death a few months later.”

Besides Ms. Richards, Mr. Stock is survived by three children, Rodney Stock, John Raymond and Christina Stock; a grandson; and five great-grand-children.

He also leaves friends like Ted Mase, a freelance photojournalist who first encountered Mr. Stock about six years ago while taking pictures in a Sarasota park.

“He said he was also a photographer, which I didn’t take notice of,” Mr. Mase recalled on Thursday. “Then he said he was with Magnum, and I thought the old boy was crazy. Found out it was true, and from that point on we just bonded.”

In a comment to Lens, Mr. Mase said, “Dennis, through Magnum and on his own, tried to do what he could to keep the integrity, honesty and high standards of this art form going in the right direction.”
436 2010-01-15 Mr. Becker’s supporters say he believes employers should have a voice in union elections, but should not be able to force workers to attend anti-union meetings. Mr. Harkin called Mr. Becker “one of the pre-eminent labor law thinkers in the United States,” and said Mr. Becker would approach the job “with an impartial and open mind.”

Wilma B. Liebman, the board’s Democratic chairwoman, said of the stalemate: “This reflects how our political process is paralyzed at the moment. This is not the way government is supposed to function.”

In 2008, Democratic senators blocked confirmation of President George W. Bush’s nominees to the board.

Ms. Liebman said the board’s two-member status had meant years of delay for many aggrieved workers. For instance, workers at a home for the developmentally disabled in Brooklyn voted to unionize in June 2003, but they do not have a union because they are awaiting a decision from the board.

“Any time you have cases pending at the board for two or three years,” said James J. Brudney, a labor law professor at Ohio State, “that’s a real hardship for the litigants, particularly for people who were fired illegally and want to get reinstated or receive back pay.”

In May, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed with several other circuit courts and ruled that the decisions of the two-member board could not be enforced. Labor board officials say this could block enforcement of the 80 N.L.R.B. decisions. Indeed, if a litigant dislikes a board ruling, it could rush to appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit, rather than to another circuit, to have the ruling nullified.

The Supreme Court has agreed to resolve the dispute between the circuits.

Marshall B. Babson, whom President Ronald Reagan appointed to the board, is the principal author of an amicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce urging the Supreme Court to rule that decisions by the two-member board cannot be enforced.

Mr. Babson pointed to language in a 1947 amendment to the National Labor Relations Act, saying a three-member quorum was needed for the board to issue decisions.

But the law also states that the full board can delegate its decision-making authority to three-member panels, of which two members can constitute a quorum. In 2007, shortly before several members stepped down, the board authorized a three-member panel, including Ms. Liebman and Peter C. Schaumber, a Republican and the board’s other member, to issue rulings.

“I do think we have the authority to issue decisions,” Mr. Schaumber said. “Keep in mind, when we agree on decisions, it means two people who ideologically differ have reached a decision about imperatives under the statute.”

Ms. Liebman and Mr. Schaumber say they have handled many cases where agreement was straightforward, but they have decided not to adjudicate some of the larger issues facing the board — like whether a union and employer break the law when they negotiate wages and other terms of a tentative contract even before the workers vote to unionize.

In late December, the Senate returned Mr. Becker’s name and those of five other federal nominees to Mr. Obama after failing to confirm them. White House officials say Mr. Becker will be renominated next week, and officials with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee say it will seek to vote over the next few weeks to send his nomination to the floor.

Last October, the committee voted 15 to 8 to confirm Mr. Becker, with two Republicans, including Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the committee’s senior Republican, voting to confirm him.

Mr. Enzi’s labor policy director, Brian Hayes, is one of the three nominees to the board. The other is Mark Pearce, a union-side lawyer in Buffalo.

“It’s harder to get confirmed than it was 25 years ago,” said Mr. Babson, the board member under Mr. Reagan. “The extremes on either side have become more dug in.”
437 2010-01-15 BAGHDAD — Iraq’s independent electoral commission on Thursday barred about 500 candidates from running in parliamentary elections in March, among them an influential Sunni Muslim politician, in a decision that could stoke sectarian tensions here and deprive the vote of crucial legitimacy in the eyes of part of the electorate.

The decision could undermine what many viewed as a key accomplishment of the political process here: agreement by nearly all Iraqi factions to take part in the vote, unlike previous elections that were boycotted out of fear of insurgent violence or in protest of American involvement.

Among those barred were the defense minister, Abdul-Kader Jassem al-Obeidi, and Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni who is the head of the National Dialogue Front.

Mr. Mutlaq’s group, in alliance with Ayad Allawi, a former prime minister, had emerged as a leading force in predominantly Sunni provinces, which were underrepresented in the last parliamentary vote, in 2005. Depending on how many seats they secured in Parliament, the alliance could have had a say in choosing Iraq’s new prime minister.

The absence of Mr. Mutlaq and other Sunni candidates could produce a situation that American officials here have long feared: another election reinforcing Sunni disenfranchisement, and just as the United States military begins its withdrawal of tens of thousands of combat troops.
438 2010-01-15 Todd Stern, the chief American climate change negotiator, said Thursday that the flawed and incomplete agreement reached last month in Copenhagen could provide significant benefits if countries followed through on its provisions.

The three-page Copenhagen Accord is not legally binding, and the 192 nations that took part in the December talks did not formally accept it. But a sizable group of those countries said they would accept its terms and provide plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by Jan. 31.

Wealthy countries also said they would follow through on promises to come up with $30 billion over the next three years to help developing countries adapt to global climate changes.

“It is incredibly important that those things happen,” Mr. Stern told investors gathered for a conference at the United Nations in New York, in his first public comments since the Copenhagen talks ended on Dec. 19. “The accord is lumbering down the runway, and now it needs to get speed so it can take off.”

Mr. Stern also said that the Obama administration remained committed to securing passage of comprehensive energy and climate change legislation to meet its own promises to reduce global warming emissions by about 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.
439 2010-01-15 On Thursday, Intel, the first major tech company to report earnings, said that revenue rose 28 percent to $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter, and the company earned the largest gross profit margin in its history. Net income was $2.3 billion, or 40 cents a share, up tenfold from the $234 million, or 4 cents a share, it earned in the last quarter of 2008.

This week, Gartner, a technology research firm, reported that worldwide PC shipments rose 22 percent to 90 million units during the fourth quarter, which is a healthy recovery from the dismal fourth quarter of 2008. Because of its investment in the downturn, Intel, which makes the chips at the heart of most PCs, is poised to benefit from that surge more than most tech firms.

“They continued to innovate while many of their competitors were swimming in debt and reducing their head count,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. “The big and strong will emerge even stronger from the downturn, and Intel is no exception.”

Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Intel to earn 30 cents a share on revenue of $10.17 billion, significantly underestimating Intel’s performance. Company executives attributed the gains to its manufacturing strengths and a long-term plan that lowered the company’s annual operations spending.

“The cumulative impact has left us more nimble, more competitive and more flexible that I can ever recall — certainly since the ’70s,” wrote Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, in an e-mail interview before the earnings report.

But Intel also showed especially strong gains from one of its riskiest bets in recent memory — the Atom chip, a cheaper processor that is used in the small laptops known as netbooks and is being adapted for use in smartphones. The company said it sold $1.4 billion of Atom chips over the last year.

Intel executives had feared that the Atom and netbooks could undermine the company’s more profitable business with traditional laptops, but they pushed hard on the products anyway. The new plants produce the chip at a lower cost, and Intel is the leading player in the fast-growing netbook market.

“I have to give them a pat on the back for having the guts to go with Atom despite the fact that it could have hurt their business,” said Fred Weber, a former executive with Intel’s rival, Advanced Micro Devices. “They built the right chip for the right time.”

But there are clouds on the horizon.

Although Intel recently paid A.M.D. $1.25 billion to settle long-running litigation, the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general’s office have filed sweeping antitrust lawsuits against the company. The European Union fined Intel $1.45 billion last May. The governments charge that the company, the world’s largest chip maker, has abused its market power to squelch competition and charge higher prices to its customers.

Industry experts also wonder how long Intel can continue to leverage its manufacturing muscle. Contract chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continue to improve their production skills and have a wide variety of customers that help keep their plants full.

Intel’s rivals like A.M.D. and Qualcomm are reducing capital costs by using such contract chip makers. Indeed, A.M.D. spun off its factories into a new chip-making venture called Globalfoundries, which is backed by large investments from the government of Abu Dhabi.

China continues to invest in contract chip makers as well.

More significantly, demand for chips that use the ARM architecture, a competitor to Intel’s architecture, has been rising. Most commonly found in cellphones, ARM chips have started to make their way into computers and even computer servers — two markets where Intel commands an approximately 80 percent share.

“There is a possibility that Intel’s financial monopoly will be broken,” said Mr. Weber, who has also received past investments from Intel for a start-up. “Was this Intel’s last chance to crank that old model? I highly doubt it. But it’s actually getting interesting to speculate about now.”

Intel generated in $11 billion in cash from its operations last year, and its financial strength has enabled it to withstand the economic and political winds and still pour money into some of the most expensive manufacturing facilities ever built.

The company’s critics have long contended that it has earned such a luxury through anticompetitive practices. But other large tech firms are in similarly strong positions and have used the recession as an opportunity to get a leg up on competitors.

Oracle, the leader in database software, has moved to acquire the fallen angel Sun Microsystems, adding a large hardware business to its portfolio. Cisco Systems, the largest networking equipment seller, spent more than $7 billion last year on acquisitions that bolstered its positions in new markets. And Hewlett-Packard, the largest technology company, added the vast services business of Electronic Data Systems to complement its hardware and software product lines.

Mr. Otellini makes no apologies about Intel’s favorable position and said the company would march on into new areas like cellphones, cars and consumer devices on the back of its manufacturing might.

“Everyone in the company knows that innovation is our lifeblood and did a fabulous job on delivering it,” he said.
440 2010-01-15 In a tale all too familiar in cash-strapped California, the foster care system has been coming apart from inadequate state financing for at least 20 years, officials at the county level say. In the past two months, a succession of key court decisions in favor of care providers lifted hopes that the judicial rulings might finally turn things around, but the lawsuits have simultaneously shed light on a system that has been cut to the bone.

Jill Duerr Berrick, a professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, said that sooner or later the children would suffer.

“The supply and demand problem is so pressing,” Professor Berrick said, “that a child services agency is not always capable of finding the type of care that a child needs.

“The decline is going to continue for a while, but at some point state and county officials are going to have ask whether these shifts in care-giving settings are in the child’s best interests.”

While the teenagers in need still have places to go, these places are farther from their homes and offer fewer services.

From West Oakland to East Los Angeles to townships in the shadow of the Sierras, the neglected or abused boys are taken hundreds of miles to the Excell Center. Statewide, there are now 1,402 homes, down from 1,759 five years ago. During the trial of the federal lawsuit filed on behalf of group homes last year, the state said it paid the facilities 76 percent of their costs.

For foster parents, the math is even more skewed. Regina Deihl, a Half Moon Bay foster parent who filed a similar lawsuit against the state on behalf of individual foster parents, said that with compensation for foster parents covering only 68 percent of the actual cost, there had been nearly a 50 percent drop in the number of licensed foster parents in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties since 1991.

“Kids are being outsourced to the Central Valley,” Ms. Deihl said.

In Southern California more than 90 percent of foster care placements were in the child’s home county, according to data compiled for the state by the University of California, Berkeley.

It is different in the north. In San Mateo County, the figure was 23.8 percent; in San Francisco it was 36 percent — not quite 50 of the city’s 130 placements. The figures for Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties were 59.2 percent and 69.7 percent, respectively.

Many officials and experts say the group home’s demise is a sign that the state is shifting toward a healthier child-welfare philosophy that favors placement with relatives, whenever possible. State data show that 4,116 children are in group homes, down from a high of more than 6,900 in 2004.

Others, however, worry that the swift disappearance of local providers results in faraway or inappropriate placements that hamper efforts to rehabilitate children with their families. These cases also add to the strains on California’s social workers, who already juggle caseloads twice the recommended limit, said Frank J. Mecca, director of the County Welfare Directors Association of California.

Local social-service officials disagree that distant placement is always a problem. Trent Rhorer, San Francisco’s head of human services, said his county had no difficulty finding nearby placements for children. Asked about the 64 percent of youths placed out of the city, Mr. Rhorer suggested that the numbers failed to account for San Francisco’s small size.

“You have to remember this is a county of seven by seven miles,” he said, “so Daly City or Oakland, just across the bridge, are considered ‘out-of-county.’ ”

Across that bridge, Tara Beckman, the deputy director of Alameda County’s Court Appointed Special Advocates Program, does not have enough space for wards from her own county. Ms. Beckman said the youths who needed more special services were being placed in homes in other parts of the state.

“There just aren’t the placements in Alameda to put them,” she said. Alameda’s in-county placement rate is 45.6 percent.

Kathy Marsh, a placement supervisor for Contra Costa County, said she had sent children to Redding, Nevada City and Victorville. Those placements severely test her department, as case workers, who are supposed to visit their assigned children once a month, often cut their visits short because they are so busy.

To help one other, some who are visiting distant facilities drop in on children assigned to a co-worker, to save the other person a trip.

“The mileage they put on is just ridiculous,” Ms. Marsh said. But with several homes closing in the county every year, she added, it has not been a matter of choice.

“We just don’t have programs in-county to meet those needs anymore,” she said.

The lack of money affects not just where the children live, but also how much money is spent on clothes and food, and how well workers in those group homes are compensated.

According to the California Alliance of Child and Family Services, which filed the suit on behalf of group homes, the California Necessities Index, a measure of price inflation for goods like food and clothes, has risen by 76 percent since 1990, the last time federal compensation guidelines were drawn. The state has raised its payments by 33 percent in the past 20 years.

The rates set in 1990 also assumed an hourly wage of $5.93 for entry-level child-care workers, 40 percent above the minimum wage of $4.25. The equivalent wage that is supported by state payments today is 22 cents above the state minimum wage of $8 an hour.

In November, a federal judge blocked the state’s plan to save $19 million by further cutting payments to group homes by 10 percent, which would have supported an entry-level wage below the state minimum.

“I know the state is in serious straits,” said Judge Marilyn H. Patel of Federal District Court, who expressed concern of “injury beyond repair” to children in group homes. “We’re talking about children one step away from the criminal justice system.”

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in December that the California Department of Social Services was in violation of a federal law because it failed to fully compensate group homes.

Despite its location 110 miles from San Francisco, the Excell Center near Turlock has roots in the Bay Area. Its parent organization, Aspiranet, operated 10 homes with 64 beds in San Mateo County in the 1980s. But it struggled to stay afloat, so Vernon M. Brown, Aspiranet’s director, moved much of the operation to the Central Valley.

The company thrived. It now employs more than 700 people statewide. Fifty-two boys are at the campus near Turlock.

“You’re paying someone $14 an hour in there and $9 an hour out here,” said Christopher Essary, who runs the Turlock program. “That’s the difference.”

As Mr. Essary spoke last month in the living room of one of the tidy homes, the boy from San Francisco, now a slight 15-year-old, ate corn dogs in the kitchen.

Eighteen months ago, when social workers picked the boy up, he left behind a life of clashes in his grandmother’s Inner Richmond home, but also carefree moments spent with friends at the Westfield Mall or the Shiekh Shoes store downtown. The day he arrived at his new home, he said, his first thought was “AWOL-ing” — running away.

He has not acted on the impulse.

“I got used to it,” the boy said with a shrug. “We had some fun trips, like to Disneyland.”

His grandmother has never visited.
441 2010-01-15 Strasbourg has provided an international platform for hundreds of cases damaging to the government. One of the most damaging had been expected to grab attention on Thursday, the day of the first hearing in a $100 billion lawsuit filed by the former managers of Yukos, the oil company once run by the imprisoned oligarch Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.

The court said Tuesday that the hearing would be delayed for a third time, until March 4, because two Russian representatives would not be available. One became ill, and the other was needed to address the Parliament before the ratification vote, said Karinna Moskalenko, one of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s lawyers.

Leaders of the Council of Europe, which established the human rights court, have worked hard to convince Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and President Dmitri A. Medvedev that the reforms “had become a key link in the relationship,” said Thomas Hammarberg, the human rights commissioner at the council. Russia will be held to the same rules that apply to other members, and no changes were made to the protocol during negotiations.

“What they probably feel is that they have been listened to — their concerns have been heard,” Mr. Hammarberg said. “I think it has been more of a political process than a juridical process.”

But Mr. Vyatkin said the council had provided written commitments on the Russians’ main fears. He said he was reassured that Russian judges would be included in reviews of potential cases against Russia, that the court would not begin investigating complaints before cases were formally accepted and that the court would not have new powers to force rulings to be carried out.

He said his European colleagues had ignored Russians’ complaints for years. “The main thing is, we explained to our colleagues that ultimatums will not solve anyone’s problems,” he said. “Let’s talk. It is already clear that without Russian participation, the Council of Europe will be of no use to anyone.”

Aleksei V. Makarkin, a leading analyst at the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow policy research group, said such compromises could have been reached at any time in the last four years. What has changed, he said, is the atmosphere in Moscow. “We have begun to change our relationship to the West,” Mr. Makarkin said. “We no longer have the feeling that Europe wants to build revolutions here.”

In terms of domestic politics, he added, “I would put it in the context of very careful, very gradual steps toward liberalization.”
442 2010-01-15 Delirious, deranged, gonzo or just gone, baby, gone — no single adjective or even a pileup does justice to “House,” a 1977 Japanese haunted-house freakout. Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi, this energetic exemplar of pulp surrealism began surfacing in the United States last year, playing at events like the New York Asian Film Festival. Now, in advance of the Criterion DVD, which will be released later this year, it is receiving its first, must-see-now domestic theatrical run at the IFC Center in New York. A midnight movie in lysergic spirit and vibe, this was a film made for late-night screening and screaming.

The yelps you’ll hear and possibly emit, though, will be of surprise and delight, not terror. “House,” which turns on a misbegotten, increasingly violent trip taken by seven teenage girls, is not in the least scary, despite its body count and gore. If the hairs on your neck snap to attention, it will be only because of Mr. Obayashi’s flamboyant visual style, his comic flights of fancy and genre manipulations. This might be about a haunted house, but it’s the film that is more truly possessed: in one scene a piano bites off the fingers of a musician tickling its keys; in another a severed head tries to take a bite out of a girl’s rear, snapping at the derrière as if it were an apple. Later a roomful of futons goes on the attack.

The decapitated noggin also flies through the air, but that’s getting, um, ahead of the story, which opens with two uniformed teenage girls putting on a little photo shoot, prettily posing and laughing. You quickly discover that one, who’s known as Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami), a moniker used by both her friends and father (Saho Sasazawa), is the center from which all the other chaotic parts flow and twist. Although she seems like a model daughter (her insistent smile could light up Tokyo or at least a toothpaste commercial), she churns with jealousy after her father introduces her to his new girlfriend, Ryoko (Haruko Wanibuchi), another wide-smiling beauty whose lightly billowing hair and clothes suggest that she keeps company with an off-screen wind machine.

In a bid to get away from home, Gorgeous decides to visit her dead mother’s sister (Yoko Minamida). The aunt agrees in a letter that arrives, partly or so it seems, with the help of a white cat that inexplicably materializes one day. Gorgeous enlists six of her friends as accompaniment, a giggling retinue of nymphs fancifully named Sweet, Melody, Fantasy, Prof, Mac and Kung Fu. Traveling by train, wheels and foot, they arrive at an isolated house, where the aunt, who’s in a wheelchair (if not for long!), lives with her white cat, whose eyes beam out ominous green sparks and who has been immortalized in artwork throughout the house. Things soon start to go very badly for the teenagers.

It’s easy to track the plot points in “House” and rather more difficult to grasp why Mr. Obayashi tells the story the way he does, to gauge the significance of the gaudy colors, the old-fashioned techniques (he periodically irises up and down), the superimpositions and flurries of jump cuts. The exterior backdrops tend to be overtly artificial, the skies so streaked with orange that you half expect to see Scarlett O’Hara shaking her fist at the heavens. A scene with Gorgeous, her father and his new squeeze, meanwhile, is shot through a multipaned window that separates the camera (and us) from the characters, one of several such distancing strategies. There are close-ups, but many are so glossy and stylized that they look like advertisements.
443 2010-01-15 “My father invented some apparatuses and acts that I use now,” Mr. Nock, 41, said. “The sway pole, the space wheel and riding a motorcycle on a high wire. When I was growing up, we weren’t allowed to have a motorcycle to ride on the street. It was too dangerous. But on a high wire was O.K.”

Mr. Nock, the youngest of four boys, grew up knowing that he wanted to be a clown and said he was determined from the start to continually reinvent his act. “I always had that drive,” he said. “You can’t count the hours in the day that you put into it, but that work is washed away by the response of the audience. In the circus and in life there is this thing called perfect balance — you’re always in search of that.”

The contortionists Long Bing and Long Jun Long, twin brothers, look like teenagers in the ring, as they squeeze their ridiculously flexible bodies through narrow tubes and balance on each other’s hands. But they are 41, and have been professional acrobats ever since graduating from a performing-arts school in Guizhou province in southwest China. “No one in our family did anything like that,” said Long Bing, “and my parents weren’t very happy about it, specially since we were good students. But we really liked it.”

In 1994 the twins were invited to join a circus in San Francisco, and managed to get permission to go from the Chinese government. Since then they have mostly lived and worked in Las Vegas, joining Big Apple for the first time this season. “We had missed circus life, playing to kids and families and being part of a bigger family of other performers,” Long Bing said.

Long Jun said that they “live a very simple life.”

“We train, we do shows,” he added. “And in New York we’ve seen lots of Broadway shows and museums. We love the culture.”

Have they been to Chinatown to eat? “Yes,” Long Jun said cautiously. “The food is a little ... American.”

Long blond hair flowing, long blue dress swirling, Ms. Zerbini guides her three horses through complicated figures around the circus ring with simple, graceful arm gestures. She is following in the footsteps of nine generations of circus family. “My dad’s side, from Italy, performed with tigers and elephants,” she explained. “My mother’s side, from France, did trapeze.”

Ms. Zerbini, 32, learned both, performing as an aerialist before meeting Sultan Kumisbayev, a member of a Cossack troupe from Kazakhstan, and deciding to develop an equestrian act. “I learned everything about training animals from my parents,” she said. “It takes about six months to teach the horses a new routine and get them used to new skills. They are very intelligent animals.”

Ms. Zerbini grew up on the road with her family; she has three sisters, one of whom performs with elephants and two with horses. Now her children, who are 3 and 8, are growing up as she did, she said, “watching shows and playing with the other circus kids.”

Will they follow in their parents’ footsteps? “I’m not sure,” Ms. Zerbini said. “They see how much work it is.”

In a nondescript red dress, yellow stockings, a strand of pearls, and gray curly wig, Mr. Lubin has been Grandma, the Big Apple’s signature clown, for much of the last 19 years. His mute, hilarious antics are delivered with a mixture of ladylike propriety and subversive mischief; popcorn spitting is not unknown.

“The character of Grandma developed over time, and for some reason I love it more than ever,” said Mr. Lubin, 57, who did not come from a circus family. He grew up in New Jersey and aspired to be a television director, but auditioned for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, was accepted and eventually performed with that circus.

Although he has made some attempts to leave the circus — he did stand-up comedy in New York for a few years, and has tried his hand at teaching and directing — Mr. Lubin said that he loves the life. “I have a home in New Jersey, but whenever I’m there I feel very itchy to get back on the road. I think the New York gig is the premier circus gig in the world; there you are, living right next to the Met.”

He is frank about the downsides. “I would say the circus essentially ended my marriage because I was traveling so much,” he said.

Mr. Anastasini, whose winsome dogs are an unfailing hit with all ages in the audience, was literally born in the circus, “on the lot, in Barcelona.” His parents, from Italy, had an acrobatic act, an aunt was an opera singer, an uncle a ballet dancer. “My whole family has been in entertainment for eight generations, and at 3 I was riding a horse in the circus,” he said.

Mr. Anastasini, 52, trained as an acrobat and juggler, and developed an act with his brother that they brought to the United States in 1979. They married two sisters, trapeze artists from Mexico, and added aerial work to their routines. But 13 years ago Mr. Anastasini fell 50 feet from a spinning wheel and broke many bones.

“When I was about 12,” he said, “my parents were performing in a circus in Madrid, and there were lots of stray dogs. I would take them in and play circus with them, train them to jump through hoops and push a water barrel.”

He revived his old interest, started looking for dogs in pounds, and eventually rescued and trained 32 of them. Now he has eight dogs that travel with him, his wife and their two boys in their specially designed 30-foot trailer that holds a grooming area with bath, radio and television. “Naturally my children want to be in the circus,” he said. “They are always inventing new acts.”

When Francisco Tebar Honrubia, who performs as Picaso Jr., projects Ping-Pong balls into the air from his mouth, or propels plates across the big top and back as if they were boomerangs, he makes you want to rub your eyes in disbelief. Perhaps it’s genetic. His father, El Gran Picaso, was a famed juggler — “the first,” Mr. Tebar said, “to do mouth juggling.”

But Mr. Tebar considered himself too shy for a performing career and studied economics in his family’s hometown, Valencia, Spain. The turning point came, he said, while he was doing his compulsory military service in Melilla on the North African coast.

“A little family circus, which I knew, came there, and I was captivated by the community, the show, everyone together,” he said. “I said to myself, I’m going to try this.”

He developed a double act with his father, and has worked as a solo performer since 1998. His wife, a lawyer, and their two children, 5 and 8, travel with him. “Circus life is great, but it’s hard for circus performers to have roots,” Mr. Tebar said. “Perhaps we’ll try to have a more stable life when our children get a bit older.”
444 2010-01-15 Perhaps the most impressive fact is that the new information will be available this year. Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, decided to fight her way through bureaucratic delays to get the new rule out just in time for this year’s proxy season. Under normal S.E.C. procedures, there is little doubt the changes would have been effective a year from now, not this year.

In less than a year, Ms. Schapiro has established a reputation for careful but determined reform, of the commission itself and of the markets it regulates.

She took over a commission whose final Bush-era chairman, Christopher Cox, remains an enigma. Evidently brought in with a mandate to keep things quiet, he did that by doing little unless everyone agreed. By giving a veto to Paul Atkins, a member of the S.E.C. who was basically against regulating Wall Street, he ensured that nothing good would happen.

Enforcement slowed and the morale of the S.E.C.’s staff plunged. The collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers showed that S.E.C. inspections had been close to useless. In the final blow, the exposure of Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme made the commission’s enforcement staff appear inept at best. There was talk that the S.E.C. might not survive a regulatory restructuring.

Now it looks safe and even effective. It is moving forward with giving shareholders a bigger role in choosing directors, despite howls of pain from corporate chief executives. That idea had been around for years and was almost adopted before Mr. Cox arrived, but there are other areas where the new S.E.C. is pioneering.

One of Ms. Schapiro’s most important moves was to establish a division of risk, strategy and financial innovation headed by Henry Hu, a Texas law professor who had written extensively on regulatory issues produced by financial innovation. This week the commission moved to at least reduce the advantages some hedge funds give themselves through rapid access to markets, and it put out a thoughtful request for comments on how such things as high-frequency trading should be regulated.

Writing rules will not be easy, or free of controversy, but the commission appears to have staff now to do the job. It may also help that the enforcement division is getting specialists who will concentrate on certain types of violations.

In contrast to some of the issues involving derivatives and superspeed trading, the disclosure of executive pay had been well debated long before Ms. Schapiro arrived. But the speed of action is still impressive. The S.E.C. proposed the rules in July, and it appears to have carefully weighed comments in changing its proposals without abandoning the goal. The rules were adopted on Dec. 16, a date that seems to have been chosen because it meant the rules could take effect Feb. 28, one day before the first 2010 proxies are due from large companies.

The principal change investors will see is in the summary table for each of the top executives — the chief executive, the chief financial officer and the three other highest-earning executives.

Under a system adopted by the Cox-led commission, the table has done a good job except when it came to equity grants — the most important part of the package for many executives.

That is because it used the amount of pay that was taken as an expense for each executive each year. There were two problems with that. First, it spread options awards over several years based on when the options vested. That meant that an executive could be given a huge options grant, perhaps on hiring, without the company having to disclose it, even if that was the largest pay package the company gave out that year.

The second problem was that accounting for options can produce some strange results. Under some circumstances, the expense can turn negative if the share price plunges. That meant some executives were reported as having worked without pay — even if their salaries were in the millions. In some cases, identical grants to two executives could produce wildly different results if one of the executives was old enough to retire.

The new summary table will count the grants as they are made. If someone gets a mega-grant, he or she is likely to show up in that year’s proxy disclosure. If a company chooses not to give options to an executive — perhaps because of poor performance — that will show up with a clarity that was not present before.

The new rules also will require companies to disclose if compensation policies are increasing the risk of the company having to take large losses, as seems to have happened in financial institutions before the crisis. There are unlikely to be many such disclosures, but being forced to think about it could produce needed changes in policies.

The game that is left open for companies to play concerns the valuation of performance-based incentives — ones that will pay off if the company hits certain goals. The value shown in the summary table will be the amount the company thinks is the most probable to be paid. It could even be zero. A footnote will show the maximum value for the executive if everything goes right, but it is the value in the table that is most likely to be noticed.

Auditors will have to sign off on that probable value, but since it relies on forecasts of the future, they are unlikely to challenge even halfway reasonable estimates. Since the exact performance targets are often not disclosed, it will be hard to tell if a company is being excessively conservative in estimating the value.

The summary table, even if it is as good as anyone can design, cannot tell the full story. Much of the value in pay packages comes from restricted stock and stock options, whose ultimate value will be clear only years later. New “claw-back” provisions may mean that this year’s grant could vanish next year. Other parts of the proxy will still show the profits executives realize when they cash in those grants, and deserve attention from investors.

Executive compensation is getting more attention this year than it may deserve, stirred by anger over the bonuses paid by banks that would be dead but for government bailouts. At least now we will be in a better position to intelligently discuss how much the pay really was.
445 2010-01-15 The Federal Reserve must have a “strong voice and authority” on regulatory matters, Paul Volcker, an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said on Thursday.

Mr. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, told a lunch meeting at the Economic Club of New York that he had been “particularly disturbed” by proposals to strip the Fed of its supervisory and regulatory responsibilities.

“What seems to me beyond dispute, given recent events, is that monetary policy and the structure and condition of the banking and financial system are irretrievably intertwined,” said Mr. Volcker, who chairs the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, a panel of outside advisers set up at the start of the Obama administration.

Mr. Volcker said that administration plans to impose a fee on major financial institutions to recoup the cost of bank bailouts was “not an unreasonable response, given the fact that he’s got to do something.”
446 2010-01-15 WASHINGTON  President Obama laid down his proposal for a new tax on the nation’s largest financial institutions on Thursday, saying he wanted “to recover every single dime the American people are owed” for bailing out the economy.

With both anti-Wall Street sentiment and the budget deficit running high, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill welcomed the proposal, which could ultimately raise up to $117 billion to cover projected bailout losses. Republicans were uncharacteristically silent, their instinctive opposition to tax increases apparently checked by their fear of defending big bankers. And the financial industry lobby seemed splintered, with small community banks happily exempted.

The biggest question, then, might be whether liberals in Mr. Obama’s own party would press him to go even further than he and Democratic moderates wanted to go. About the same time that the president was announcing his plan at the White House, a group of House Democrats held a news conference to call for a 50 percent tax on bonuses exceeding $50,000 at banks that took bailout money.

The administration has opposed taxing bonuses in the past, saying shareholders should determine corporate pay policies. Mr. Obama, in his remarks, suggested that his proposal to tax some of banks’ assets could have the same effect, by forcing them to shrink the size of their bonuses in turn.

Flanked by his economic advisers at the White House, Mr. Obama spoke in some of his harshest language to date about the resurgent financial industry.

“We’re already hearing a hue and cry from Wall Street suggesting that this proposed fee is not only unwelcome but unfair,” he said. “That by some twisted logic it is more appropriate for the American people to bear the cost of the bailout rather than the industry that benefited from it, even though these executives are out there giving themselves huge bonuses.”

Mr. Obama continued, “What I say to these executives is this: Instead of sending a phalanx of lobbyists to fight this proposal or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help evade the fee, I suggest you might want to consider simply meeting your responsibilities”  including by rolling back bonuses.

The proposed tax would apply to bank, thrift and insurance companies with more than $50 billion in assets and would start after June 30. It would not apply to certain holdings, like customers’ insured savings, but to assets in risk-taking operations. The levy would raise an estimated $90 billion over 10 years, according to the White House.

But it would remain in force longer if all losses to the bailout fund, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, were not recovered after a decade. The Treasury now projects that the losses from the $700 billion loan program, which was created in October 2008, could reach $117 billion, about a third of the loss that it projected last summer  an improved forecast that reflected the renewed strength on Wall Street.

The White House said that collecting $117 billion would take about 12 years, but Treasury officials said losses were likely to be smaller. Still, with postrecession deficits at levels unseen since World War II and Wall Street never broadly popular, the pressure on a future president and Congress to keep the tax in place is likely to be substantial. Administration officials did not outline any provision for having the tax expire once all the money is recouped.

Big banks object that most of them already have repaid the government with interest. The administration, anticipating that argument, called its tax a “financial crisis responsibility fee” aimed at those institutions whose risk-taking caused the problem in the first place.

The losses from the bailout fund are expected from money paid to rescue Chrysler and General Motors and the insurance giant American International Group, and from a program to help homeowners avert foreclosures. But big banks shared in the A.I.G. bailout, splitting about $60 billion to receive full repayment for their financial trades with the company.

Mr. Obama’s economic team began seeking a bank fee last August, even as the administration  and in particular the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner  was being attacked by critics on the left and right as too cozy with Wall Street. Criticism picked up last year after Mr. Geithner opposed an effort by the European Union to impose a global tax on financial transactions.

Mr. Geithner said such a tax would be passed through to customers. The administration now argues that big banks will not be able to pass on the costs of its levy without risking a loss of market share to rivals that are not subject to the tax.

The proposal, which Mr. Obama will include in his budget in February, would require Congress’s approval.

451 2010-01-16 WASHINGTON (AP) — A House committee is broadening its investigation of secretive bank bailouts to include the former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the former Federal Reserve Bank of New York chairman Stephen Friedman.

The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has invited Mr. Paulson and Mr. Friedman to testify about their roles in the bailout of the American International Group, according to the chairman, Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York.

Lawmakers want to know more about deals that funneled billions from A.I.G. to banks including Goldman Sachs. Mr. Friedman is a Goldman director who resigned from the New York Fed after concerns he had conflicts of interest.

Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee’s top Republican, also said he wanted the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke to answer questions about the bailout.

The bailouts were managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. Mr. Geithner has defended the deals and will testify on Jan. 27.

Mr. Issa also wanted the committee to demand documents from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve by issuing subpoenas. Representatives for Mr. Paulson and Mr. Friedman would not comment. A Treasury spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
452 2010-01-16 Steve Gruber came off the bench to score 15 points Friday night as Brown beat Yale, 75-66, in the teams’ Ivy League opener.

The game was tied five times in the second half. Knotted at 43-43 with 13 minutes 56 seconds left, the visiting Bears (7-11) went on a 10-2 run, capped by a 3-pointer by Gruber who had 7 points in the spurt. After the Bulldogs (6-12) pulled within 3, Brown used a 10-1 run to pull away, ending Yale’s two-game winning streak.

Matt Mullery, the Bears’ leader in scoring, rebounding, assists and blocked shots who injured his ankle against Army on Jan. 6, returned after a one-game absence. He played 27 minutes and scored 5 points to help the Bears end a two-game skid.

Andrew McCarthy added 14 points for Brown, which trailed by 31-29 at halftime.

LOYOLA (MD.) 68, MARIST 61 The freshman Robert Olson scored a career-high 20 points, helping Loyola (Md.) end a three-game skid with a victory against visiting Marist.

SHAWNE WILLIAMS INDICTED The former Pacer and Maverick Shawne Williams was indicted on felony drug charges. Prosecutors said that Williams was indicted Tuesday by a county grand jury on eight counts for possession and conspiracy to sell a codeine-based syrup. Williams was jailed with bond set at $16,000.

On Friday, the Nets said they had waived Williams, a 23-year-old forward, after acquiring him earlier this week from Dallas along with Kris Humphries for the veteran forward Eduardo Najera.

“We brought him in to take a look at him and he was way out of shape,” the Nets’ interim coach, Kiki Vandeweghe, said of Williams. “We sort of made the decision at that time that this wasn’t going to work, so we waived him, and all this other stuff came down. We hope he is O.K. We wish him well, but luckily it’s not our issue.”

Williams averaged 5.2 points and 2.4 rebounds in his four seasons with Indiana and Dallas. A former first-round draft pick of the Pacers in 2006, he has not played in a game this season. (AP)
454 2010-01-16 No major studies have focused on the use of such creams in this country. But dermatologists with practices that cater to darker-skinned women say adverse effects are on the rise. Ethnic beauty supply stores, where clerks often shrug at selling prescription creams over the counter, report that sales are strong.

Dr. Erin Gilbert, a chief resident in dermatology at the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said that she or a colleague saw a case of severe side effects from skin-lightening creams at least once a week. Dr. Gilbert attributed the frequency, which she called surprising, to the fact that the hospital served an “amazingly international cross section of women of color.”

Users are not necessarily immigrants, said Dr. Eliot F. Battle Jr., who has a dermatology practice in Washington, where he treats side effects from lightening creams “not only containing corticosteroids, but mercury,” a poison that can damage the nervous system. The patients are “Ph.D.’s to women from corporate America, teachers to engineers — the entire broad spectrum of women of color,” Dr. Battle said.

For years misuse was on the decline, Dr. Battle said, but now “it’s happening more because the Internet has been a great source for these patients to get physician-strength or prescription-strength products.”

Some users are seeking to lighten dark spots caused by acne or brown patches known as melasma, which are triggered by , or pills.

But many others seek to lighten their entire face or large swatches of their body, a practice common in developing countries as disparate as , and the , where it is promoted as a way to elevate one’s social standing. A small percentage of men in such countries also use the creams.

In November, some fans of , the former slugger, were surprised when photographs from the Latin ceremony showed his face as uniformly lighter. Online critics accused him of wanting to be white. Mr. Sosa, a Dominican-born American citizen, told a reporter from ESPNDeportes.com that he had used a cream nightly to “soften” his skin and that it had bleached it, too. “I’m not a racist,” he said in the interview. “I live my life happily.”

Evelyn Nakano Glenn, a professor of gender and women’s studies at the , said it was wrong to assume that skin-lightening was a cultural anachronism or an effort to negate one’s racial heritage.

“In fact, it’s a growing practice and one that has been stimulated by the companies that produce these products,” she said. “Their advertisements connect happiness and success and romance with being lighter skinned.”

Moreover, it is not as if dark-skinned women are imagining a bias, said Dr. Glenn, who is president of the American Sociological Association. “Sociological studies have shown among African-Americans and also Latinos, there’s a clear connection between skin color and socioeconomic status. It’s not some fantasy. There is prejudice against dark-skinned people, especially women in the so-called marriage market.”

There was an echo of the issue recently in comments by the Senate majority leader, , Democrat of , as reported in a new book, that he had urged to run for president because the country was ready to accept a “light skinned” African-American.

In the aisles of ethnic beauty supply stores on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, dozens of skin lighteners are for sale, most manufactured abroad. Prescription creams with clobetasol propionate were available recently for as little as $3.99.

“Clobetasol is the most potent topical steroid we make in dermatology,” said Dr. Gilbert, who works nearby. “There’s almost no indication where you’d use it on the face. And it’s basically provided to people as cosmetic products. It’s illegal.”

A salesman at Blessing Beauty Supply, who would give only his first name, Monroe, said the secret to one best-selling cream, L’Abidjanaise, was that “it has steroids in it.” Asked why he sold prescription medications illegally, he declined to answer.

A spokeswoman for the , Rita Chappelle, would not say whether the agency was pursuing such violations. “As a matter of policy, we do not discuss enforcement actions,” Ms. Chappelle wrote in an e-mail message.

Long-term use of a whitening cream with topical steroids can lead to , elevated blood sugar and suppression of the body’s natural steroids, doctors said. Some side effects, like , may be permanent.

Some doctors also identified hydroquinone as a culprit in misuse cases. At a strength of 4 percent or higher, it is prescribed for short-term use to lighten skin blemishes like sun spots. Over-the-counter versions like Fair & White contain 1.9 percent hydroquinone, but bootleg versions are being sold with 4 percent to 5 percent, said Dominique Tinkler, the manager of product development for Fair & White’s American distributor, the Mitchell Group.

“We see it in New York, , ,” Ms. Tinkler said. “I mean it’s everywhere now.”

One unusual side effect of misusing hydroquinone is a blue-black darkening of the skin. Dr. Battle said he never used to see such cases, but in the last five years his Washington practice had treated them monthly.

The food and drug agency has been considering a ban on over-the-counter sales of hydroquinone since 2006, and it is already banned in England and France.

Doctors said some consumers wrongly assumed that all ingredients were disclosed on labels.

“There’s a basic assumption that there’s some truth in labeling,” said Dr. David McDaniel, a dermatologist in and a director of the Skin of Color Research Institute at Hampton University. “That’s a false assumption for the skin-lightening market.”

Mrs. Ross of Brooklyn, who described herself as a onetime “queen of bleaching creams,” is recovering now with the help of her dermatologist from Center.

“I went through a terrible depressed phase,” she said. “I wanted to go back to use the creams a couple of months back. I just decided to ride it out with my dermatologist.”
455 2010-01-16 Capmark Investments, a unit of the bankrupt commercial property lender Capmark Financial Group, filed for bankruptcy in a bid to sell its management contracts and interests in real estate equity funds. Capmark Investments listed assets and debt of at least $1 billion on a Chapter 11 petition on Friday in Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Its parent filed for bankruptcy last year amid falling property values and a drop in lending. The unit manages equity real estate and mortgage-related investments in the public and private markets, and had more than $1.7 billion under management as of Dec. 31, according to its Web site. Capmark Investments reached a deal on Thursday to sell the contracts and general partnership interest in its real estate equity funds to an unspecified third party, it said. The unit said it would seek bankruptcy court approval of the sale.
456 2010-01-16 Detective Claude Jean-Pierre has stumbled through the terrible hours and days after the earthquake in a daze every Haitian recognizes. He slept a few hours each night and could not concentrate on work. He called relatives and searched every corner of the Internet for information. He started a list of volunteers, of police officers in his Brooklyn precinct, to go to the nation and help.

But Mr. Jean-Pierre, 41, who was born in Brooklyn, has hardly any relatives in Haiti. He has visited only twice, a long time ago for his grandfather’s funeral and once for vacation. His parents and children were safe in New York, but this week, Detective Jean-Pierre was as anxious as his Haitian-born neighbors.

His bonds to the homeland are different, but still strong. They formed on Sunday mornings when he was a child, and listened with his father to Moment Creole, a Haitian radio show broadcast in the language young Claude learned from his mother.

And as a law enforcement officer, he had a special sense of responsibility in the aftermath of the disaster. Detective Jean-Pierre, who has worked for the New York Police Department for 12 years, said he could help process the remains of victims or help keep the peace; other Haitian-American officers have served in the military or worked in the construction industry, extra qualifications.

“The earthquake was like an octopus,” he said. “It affected everyone.”

On Friday, his day off, Detective Jean-Pierre nonetheless stopped in at work, in the station house of the 70th Precinct, which covers a swath of central Brooklyn where many Haitian immigrants live, and checked in with other Haitian police officers at a nearby precinct. As he drove through the neighborhoods, he reflected on his childhood and the blur of daily life since the earthquake.
457 2010-01-16 Military officials from the countries signed up to buy the Airbus A400M transport plane reaffirmed their commitment to the much-delayed project on Friday but failed to reveal any additional financing.

“All nations remain committed to the program, but not at any price,” the British Ministry of Defense said in a statement issued in London, where a meeting was held Thursday among the countries backing the project.

“The difficulties facing the program are complex,” the statement said. “Good progress has been made on all fronts, with the only outstanding issue surrounding any additional funding.”

The statement said military officials would discuss their position in coming days with Airbus “to try to achieve an acceptable settlement.”

Airbus and its parent company, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, have asked governments to pay an additional 5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) and to accept significant delivery delays. The Airbus chief executive, Thomas O. Enders, warned on Tuesday that without an agreement soon, the project might have to be shelved, jeopardizing the future of the group and thousands of jobs.

The seven countries — Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey — had initially ordered 180 A400Ms for 20 billion euros in 2003.
458 2010-01-16 Until mid-2008, the main worries for most port operators were congestion and a lack of infrastructure to cope with demand.

Now, with shipping companies trying to save money by minimizing port calls, operators also face leaner times.

Jesper Kjaerdegaard, a partner at the maritime consulting company Mercator International in London, said that while volume at European ports was down an average of 10 percent last year, their longer-term contracts and strong profit margins allowed them to “take a breather” by slowing expansion and postponing projects.

“By the fourth quarter of 2008, we realized the world had changed, as container volumes through ports fell steeply,” said Tom Boyd, communications director at The Hague for APM Terminals, a unit of A. P. Moller-Maersk of Denmark. “The port industry had to quickly shift gears, and, in 2009, operators went into cost-control mode and renegotiated, postponed or canceled development projects.”

APM runs 49 ports and is one of the four biggest operators, alongside Hong Hutchison Ports, based in Hong Kong; PSA Singapore Terminals; and DP World of Dubai. All have been restructuring, delaying or canceling projects. DP World has the added headache of a complex debt renegotiation. The ports themselves are mostly controlled by governments and the local authorities.
459 2010-01-16 The defense minister ordered Japan’s ships to return from the Indian Ocean on Friday, fulfilling a government pledge to end an eight-year refueling mission in support of the war in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama refused to renew the law authorizing the mission, ignoring requests from the Obama administration to continue it as a show of support. Military experts have said the Japanese withdrawal would not affect military operations in Afghanistan.
460 2010-01-16 About 11,000 detainees passed through the Varick jail last year, including illegal immigrants, asylum-seekers and legal immigrants who face deportation because of past criminal convictions. Varick, which falls short of detention standards adopted in 2000, was quietly reopened in 2008 after being shuttered for seven years.

It has become the site of an ambitious volunteer legal program to counsel detainees, as well as the focus of investigative scrutiny by civil liberties lawyers. In recent weeks, it has also been a rallying point for street protests against detention and deportation that have led to arrests of some protesters, including members of the clergy, who blocked traffic as a form of civil disobedience.

Officials of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the jail in Hudson County would house immigration detainees at half the cost — $111 a day per detainee, compared with $253 at Varick. It will also provide fresh-air recreation, which the Lower Manhattan jail has never offered, though that has been required by national detention standards since 2000, officials said.

But Nancy Morawetz, a professor at the New York University School of Law and director of its Immigrant Rights Clinic, said the Hudson jail’s current federal contract did not require it to meet national detention standards, just to treat immigration detainees the same as its criminal inmates.

Students at the law clinic said they had been trying for months without success to visit detainees at the Hudson jail, including some transferred there from the Middlesex County Jail, which ended its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year. Jail visitor lists are updated only every 90 days.

“There is probably no detainee at Varick Street who, despite the problems at Varick, wouldn’t prefer to be at Varick,” Ms. Morawetz said. “This is really just moving away the problems where they’re not going to be seen.”

Her concern was echoed by Udi Ofer, advocacy director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, in an e-mail message to other lawyers representing detainees at Varick.

“I’m really worried about the motivation and impact of this closure,” he wrote. “Advocates have been scrutinizing conditions at Varick, and I think that ICE decided to simply close it and shift responsibilities to other facilities rather than fix conditions.”

In a statement, Brian P. Hale, a spokesman for the agency, said, “ICE will work with our detention providers to continue to expand the opportunities for legal and family visitation, ensure indigent detainees can correspond with family and representatives and address any inconveniences that may arise from this change.”

Senator Schumer said he had asked the immigration enforcement agency to answer in writing why it would not reconsider the decision.

“I’m convinced that they simply looked at the immediate cost, and they didn’t look at when they have fewer pro bono lawyers, it will end up costing them more,” he said.

Legal counsel can shorten time in detention, studies have found, because detainees with no legal relief from deportation are quicker to accept it, while some of those with a claim to stay in the United States are more likely to be released on bond while their case is decided.
461 2010-01-16 Most everyone needs financial advice. The big question is how much.

There are tens of thousands of advisers out there, with varying levels of expertise, who charge varying fees for their services. And professional advice doesn’t guarantee good returns. You need look no further for evidence than the market collapse of 2008-9, when most people lost money, even those with the supposedly ideal mix of investments, hand-picked by their financial planners.

Still, financial advice can cover much more than choosing investments. Many of us could use as much help in managing our debts as in increasing our savings.

So how much advice do we need? At what point should we pay for it? And how much is it worth?

Wealthy families rely on a cadre of capable professionals who cater to them, and paying for advice is as natural as paying the landscaper. For everyone else, figuring out what’s needed depends, at least in part, on your stage in life, your goals and what you expect to receive in return. Are you, in other words, a new college graduate with $50,000 in debt, $30,000 in income and a brand-new 401(k), or a 60-year-old trying to prepare for retirement? Or someone in between?

You may need only some straight-ahead advice on how to invest your retirement money, or you may really want someone to make sure you stick to your plans  the equivalent of a fiscal trainer.

“Are you paying for investment advice?” asked Carl Richards, a financial planner and proprietor of a Web site called Behavior Gap. “Are you paying for life coaching? What is the nature of the financial advice?”

Once you figure out what you are looking for, it’s easier to determine how much help you need and where to look. Of course, there’s always the possibility that you may not need professional help  maybe you’re good with numbers, a disciplined saver and enjoy managing your own money. This column is not for you.

YOU WANT INVESTMENT ADVICE The reason most people seek out a professional is for help saving and investing for retirement. You should always start by reviewing what your employer has to offer, whether through a 401(k), a 403(b) or similar retirement plan. “When you’re saving for retirement, it’s fairly homogeneous,” said Martin Riehl, principal of asset management services at Vanguard. “You need to save a lot, you need to be diversified and you need to save on costs.”

Big retirement plan providers like Fidelity and Vanguard (along with several online brokers) offer online calculators and tools that will help you figure out how much you need to save and the types of investments you need, and may offer specific investment suggestions. “There are a lot of great ones,” said Sheryl Garrett, founder of the Garrett Planning Network, based in Mission, Kan. “But they are tools, and they can be sharp objects,” she said, adding that the results are only as good as the information you put in.

If you’re looking for low-maintenance options, you can consider target-date funds, whose investment mix becomes increasingly conservative as you near retirement. This eliminates the need to rebalance your portfolio, or invest in any other funds. Just be sure the percentage of stocks in your target-date fund corresponds with your risk tolerance.

But if you’d like recommendations tailored more closely to your situation, more 401(k) plans are adding managed-account options, where you pay a fee to have your account professionally managed. Vanguard, for instance, uses Financial Engines, a well-regarded service, to build and manage investment portfolios (it can take outside assets into account, too). Taken together, Vanguard’s funds (which cost 0.2 percent of assets, on average), coupled with its managed-account service (about 0.4 percent of assets), carry less than half the cost of the average mutual fund. Both Vanguard and Fidelity offer similar services to clients investing outside a 401(k). But most of your contact with advisers will be over the phone or online.

Financial advisers also pointed to online services like MarketRiders.com, which offer an inexpensive way to build and manage a portfolio of exchange-traded funds, which are like mutual funds but trade like stocks. There are also a number of financial advisers who focus on investment services only. Rick Ferri, of Portfolio Solutions, for instance, charges 0.25 percent of assets to build and manage a portfolio of index-tracking investments, though there is a minimum charge of $2,000 a year per household.

YOU WANT A FINANCIAL CHECKUP Even the most die-hard do-it-yourself investors could use a second opinion, and everyone could use a periodic checkup to be sure they’re on track. Major life events may call for a change in plans, but not necessarily a full-time financial steward.

“I think very few people need a full-time financial planner,” said Ms. Garrett, whose network includes a group of 300 certified financial planners who charge hourly or flat fees. “There are people who do, like the proverbial little old lady from Peoria whose deceased husband took care of all the finances, or maybe you’re a very busy individual who doesn’t want to be bothered.”

Ms. Garrett said she wasn’t opposed to the idea of paying a certified financial planner a percentage of your total assets, often 1 percentage point, for comprehensive financial planning. “I just think it’s being way oversold, and the price is pretty steep.”

How much time do you need? That will depend on your situation, though Ms. Garrett said that four hours may be “luxurious” for those with relatively straightforward planning needs. Hourly planners’ rates will vary on geography and expertise.

As with anything else, Ms. Garrett said not to go for the cheapest or the most expensive  and to keep in mind that experienced planners may charge more for their time but may work faster.

YOU WANT FULL-TIME HELP If you want someone to help you every step of the way, or you want to delegate money management to a professional, you might consider a fee-only certified financial planner (one of the most rigorous professional designations) whose philosophy meshes with yours. These professionals are unbiased in the investments they choose because you pay them a percentage of your assets. Many financial experts say they believe that full-time planners are worth their fees, because of the money they may save you on the common mistakes investors are prone to make, said William Bernstein, author of “The Investor’s Manifesto: Preparing for Prosperity, Armageddon and Everything in Between” (John Wiley & Sons, 2009).

By Mr. Bernstein’s estimation, the average investor probably lags the market by two or three percentage points because they buy and sell investments at precisely the wrong times. So many people may come out ahead even if they pay 1 percentage point to a skilled adviser. “What you get from an adviser is not the winning allocation,” he said. “Who knows what the most efficient allocation is anyway? What you are getting is the discipline. And an annual checkup provides precious little discipline.”

Hiring a full-time adviser is not unlike hiring a physical trainer  someone who can teach you the proper diet and routine, and push you a little further than you may be willing to go on your own. “You should save to the point of discomfort and maybe beyond, and that is not something people will do unprompted,” said Jim McCarthy, head of client advisory and retirement services at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.

One reason some people are willing to pay a full-time planner is that they know they can call at any time without being on the clock. Mr. Richards, who runs the Behavior Gap site, said his clients had told him they called him first when they had a question or a calamity because they knew he wasn’t “starting a stop watch.”

“You don’t fix emotional problems with logic, you fix them with trust,” he said. “And that is really difficult to do, to build that over the phone if you aren’t having an ongoing relationship.”

He argued that most people needed an adviser of some sort. “Unless you wake up and see Warren Buffett in the mirror, it might be worth it to pay someone to stay the course.”
462 2010-01-16 SANA, Yemen — A Yemeni airstrike on Friday afternoon killed at least five senior members of Al Qaeda’s Arabian branch, Yemeni officials said, including the group’s military commander.

The airstrike, on a remote mountainous area in northern Yemen not far from the Saudi border, was the latest in a new American-backed campaign to cripple Al Qaeda’s regional arm, which has gained global attention since it claimed responsibility for a failed effort to bomb a Detroit-bound passenger jet on Dec. 25.

If the death of the Qaeda military commander, Qassim al-Raymi, is confirmed, it would be a serious blow to the group. Many Yemeni officials and Western terrorism analysts agree that Mr. Raymi, a veteran jihadist and the main planner of Qaeda operations here, is the group’s most important and dangerous member. Yemeni officials have announced his death at least once before, and he has eluded several attempts on his life in the past three years.

It was not clear whether the airstrike was carried out with help or coordination from the United States, which has provided firepower and intelligence for some recent raids on Al Qaeda’s Yemen-based affiliate. The Yemeni government has struggled to play down that assistance, because the specter of American intervention arouses anger in Yemen and has been used by Al Qaeda to recruit new members.

The Yemeni government has also been trying to negotiate the surrender of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who is suspected of being linked to the bomber in the Dec. 25 attempt. In addition to holding talks with Mr. Awlaki’s tribe, the government has sent troops into the area where Mr. Awlaki is living — in remote Shabwa Province — to pressure the tribe to release him, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
463 2010-01-16 The health care giant Johnson & Johnson expanded a recall of over-the-counter medications on Friday, the second time it had done so in less than a month because of a moldy smell that has made users sick.

The broadening recall includes some batches of regular and extra-strength Tylenol children’s Tylenol, eight-hour Tylenol, Tylenol arthritis, Tylenol PM, children’s Motrin, Motrin IB, Benadryl Rolaids, Simply Sleep and St. Joseph’s aspirin. Caplet and geltab products sold in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates and Fiji were recalled.

The company’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare Products unit recalled some Tylenol Arthritis Caplets in November because of the smell, which caused nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Almost three weeks ago, the company expanded its recall to include Tylenol Arthritis Caplets.

A full list of the recalled products is online.

The way the company handled the recall has irked federal regulators, who say the McNeil unit did not act fast enough.

The Food and Drug Administration said McNeil knew of the problem in early 2008 but made only a limited investigation.

“When something smells bad, literally or figuratively, companies must aggressively investigate and take all necessary action to solve the problem,” said Deborah Autor, the director of the F.D.A.’s Office of Compliance of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
464 2010-01-16 “Kickbacks in the nursing home pharmacy context are particularly nefarious,” Carmen M. Ortiz, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, said in a statement Friday. In return for Omnicare’s efforts, the drug maker allegedly paid the pharmacy company kickbacks in the form of rebates based on the market share of some Johnson & Johnson drugs, sponsorship of Omnicare meetings, grants and payments for Omnicare data, like the prescribing habits of doctors, of the kind that Omnicare had previously provided the drug maker for free, the complaint said.

“When it comes to the sometimes questionable practice of promoting brand-name drugs to doctors and their patients, this case represents the lowest of the low,” Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said in an e-mail message sent Friday in response to a reporter’s question. “Nursing home residents comprise a vulnerable population that should be able to trust that their physician’s advice is based on medical expertise, not financial self-interest.”

Although the events described in the complaint took place several years ago, Mr. Kohl wrote that the aging committee was continuing to investigate the issue of the overuse of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes.

Johnson & Johnson issued an e-mail statement in response to a reporter’s question.

“We believe airing the facts will confirm that our conduct, including rebating programs like those the government now challenges, was lawful and appropriate,” the statement said. “We look forward to the opportunity to present our evidence in court.”

Omnicare, with a market capitalization of about $3.1 billion, serves more than 1.4 million residents of nursing homes, assisted living and other health care facilities in 47 states and Canada, according to the company’s Web site.

Last November, Omnicare paid $98 million to settle civil charges by the government that it had violated the False Claims Act for engaging in kickback schemes with Johnson & Johnson and a smaller drug maker.

The settlement agreement did not include any finding of wrongdoing or any admission of liability by Omnicare, the company said in a statement issued in November. Omnicare denies the contentions of the federal complaint settled last fall and denies any liability related to those contentions, the statement said.

The government has regulations in place to protect nursing home residents from medication mismanagement, like being sedated with psychiatric drugs for the purposes of discipline or convenience. The Department of Health and Human Services requires nursing homes to arrange for an outside consulting pharmacist to review a patient’s medication regimen at least once a month.

These outside pharmacists have a duty to report any irregularities to the attending physician; the pharmacists also have the ability to recommend that a physician remove, change or add medications to a patient’s drug regimen, the complaint said.

But the government’s complaint in the Johnson & Johnson case raises the question of whether some companies have used the consultant pharmacists — the very people entrusted by the government with safeguarding the integrity of nursing home drug prescriptions — for corporate gain.

In this case, according to the complaint, Omnicare’s consultant pharmacists worked to increase Risperdal’s market share.

“If true, these allegations represent a cynical manipulation of the laws intended to protect nursing home residents, as well as yet another rip-off of the Medicaid program,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has investigated the corporate conduct of certain drug makers, said in a statement Friday in response to a reporter’s question. “If consultant pharmacists aren’t independent, both the patient and the taxpayer lose.”

In one company document among the court exhibits, for example, Omnicare said that its efforts generated a record market share high of 55.5 percent for Risperdal in the first quarter of 2000.

“This market share represents Omnicare’s ability in persuading physicians to write Risperdal in the areas of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia,” the Omnicare document said.

But Risperdal, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is not specifically approved to treat behavioral problems in elderly people with dementia. In fact, in 2005 the F.D.A. required that the labels of certain antipsychotic drugs, including Risperdal, carry a black box label warning that elderly people with dementia-related psychosis treated with such drugs were at an increased risk of death compared with those taking a placebo.

In the e-mail message to a reporter, Mr. Kohl noted that the government’s complaint was not the first charge against a drug company for improperly marketing antipsychotic drugs to aging populations.

Last January, the drug maker Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and paid $1.415 billion to settle criminal and civil charges that the drug maker had marketed its antipsychotic Zyprexa for the treatment of elderly people with dementia.

The exhibits attached to the complaint depict the efforts of Omnicare and Johnson & Johnson to increase market share for Risperdal against competing antipsychotics like Zyprexa and Seroquel from AstraZeneca.

In an Omnicare letter to Johnson & Johnson in 2001, an executive wrote that the pharmacy planned to spend about $173 million on Johnson & Johnson products.

The executive wrote in capital letters, “We are selling more high-priced drugs (read Risperdal here) for the pharmaceutical industry!!”

By The Associated Press

Johnson & Johnson expanded a recall of over-the-counter medications on Friday, the second time it had done so in less than a month because of a moldy smell that has made users sick.

The broadening recall includes some batches of regular and extra-strength Tylenol children’s Tylenol, eight-hour Tylenol, Tylenol arthritis, Tylenol PM, children’s Motrin, Motrin IB, Benadryl Rolaids, Simply Sleep and St. Joseph’s aspirin. Caplet and gel tab products sold in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates and Fiji were recalled.

The company’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare Products unit recalled some Tylenol Arthritis Caplets in November because of the smell, which caused nausea, stomach pain and diarrhea. A few weeks ago, the company expanded its recall to include Tylenol Arthritis Caplets.

Johnson & Johnson said the smell was caused by small amounts of a chemical associated with the treatment of wooden pallets. The F.D.A. said the chemical could volatilize into the air, and traced it to a plant in Las Piedras, P.R.
465 2010-01-16 Mr. Gao, 46, has long been a nettlesome critic of China’s governing Communist Party, both in his writings and through his legal cases. Before the authorities revoked his law license in 2005, Mr. Gao, a Christian, represented members of underground Christian churches and farmers whose land had been appropriated by powerful officials. At one point, he orchestrated a hunger strike by practitioners of Falun Gong, the outlawed spiritual movement.

Human rights advocates say the disappearance of Mr. Gao is particularly worrisome, given the mistreatment he said he had endured during a previous incarceration. In a letter he published after his release several years ago, he said he had confessed to sedition charges only after more than a month of torture that included jabs with an electric baton and the piercing of his genitals with toothpicks. At the time, he said, his torturers told him he would be killed if he spoke publicly about his treatment in detention.

Even after he was allowed to return to his home in Beijing, Mr. Gao’s life was restricted by security personnel who constantly shadowed him and his family.

In January last year, his wife and two children fled China. The family was aided by a Christian rights group and has been granted asylum in the United States.

Mr. Gao had no advance knowledge of their flight, said his wife, Geng He. Less than a month later he was taken away.

In an interview from New York on Friday, Ms. Geng said she was stunned to learn that the police said they could not account for her husband’s whereabouts. “If he’s alive, let us see him,” she said through tears. “If he’s dead, tell us where his body is.”

Teng Biao, a lawyer and friend of Mr. Gao, said: “This is the first time the police have come up with ‘went missing’ as an excuse. That’s impossible. Gao was in their custody and could go nowhere.”

Susan Stevenson, a spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Beijing, urged the Chinese government to ensure his safety. “Mr. Gao has courageously taken on cases involving corruption, illegal property seizure and religious persecution,” she said. “We believe such activities support China’s efforts to institute the rule of law and should be encouraged, not punished.”

Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China, based in New York, said the organization had collected accounts of Mr. Gao’s arrest from witnesses, who said he had been led away by security personnel, including local and provincial police officers, as well as special agents from Beijing who handle politically delicate cases.

“The government must give an immediate and full accounting of what they’ve done with Gao Zhisheng,” she said. “The world cannot allow them to act with impunity.”
466 2010-01-16 Over the next week or so, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to report similar surges in pay when they release their year-end numbers.

But not all the news from JPMorgan Chase was good. Signs of lingering weakness in its consumer banking business unnerved Wall Street and drove down its share price along with those of other banks.

Chase’s consumer businesses are still hemorrhaging money. Chase Card Services, its big credit card unit, lost $2.23 billion in 2009 and is unlikely to turn a profit this year. Chase retail services eked out a $97 million profit for 2009, though it posted a $399 million loss in the fourth quarter. To try to stop the bleeding, the bank agreed to temporarily modify about 600,000 mortgages. Only about 89,000 of those adjustments have been made permanent. In a statementon Friday, Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, said that bank “fell short” of its earnings potential and remained cautious about 2010 considering that the job and housing markets continued to be weak.

“We don’t have visibility much beyond the middle of this year and much will depend on how the economy behaves,” Michael J. Cavanagh, the bank’s finance chief, said in a conference call with journalists. Across the industry, analysts expect investment banking revenue to moderate this year and tighter regulations to dampen profit. As consumers and businesses continue to hunker down, lending has also fallen.

Just as it did throughout 2009, JPMorgan Chase pulled off a quarterly profit after the strong performance of its investment bank helped offset large losses on mortgages and credit cards. The bank set aside another $1.9 billion for its consumer loan loss reserves — a hefty sum, but less than in previous periods.

That could be a sign that bank executives are more comfortable that the economy may be turning a corner. The bank has now stockpiled more than $32.5 billion to cover future losses. Still, Mr. Dimon warned that the economy was still too fragile to declare that the worst was over, though he hinted that things might stabilize toward the middle of the year. “We want to see a real recovery, just in case you have another dip down,” he said in a conference call with investors. Earlier, Mr. Cavanagh said that the bank hoped to restore the dividend to 75 cents or $1 by the middle of 2010, from 20 cents at present.

Over all, JPMorgan said 2009 net income rose to $11.7 billion, or $2.26 a share. That compares with a profit of $5.6 billion, or $1.35 a share, during 2008, when panic gripped the industry. Revenue grew to a record $108.6 billion, up 49 percent.

JPMorgan has emerged from the financial crisis with renewed swagger. Unlike several other banking chiefs, Mr. Dimon has entered 2010 with his reputation relatively unscathed. Indeed, he is regarded on Wall Street and in Washington as a pillar of the industry. On Wednesday on Capitol Hill, during a hearing of the government panel charged with examining the causes of the financial crisis, Mr. Dimon avoided the grilling given to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Dimon was also the only banker to publicly oppose the administration’s proposed tax on the largest financial companies.

Moreover, JPMorgan appears have taken advantage of the financial crisis to expand its consumer lending business and vault to the top of the investment banking charts, including a top-flight ranking as a fee-earner. Over all, the investment bank posted a $6.9 billion profit for 2009 after a $1.2 billion loss in 2008 when the bank took huge charges on soured mortgage investments and buyout loans.

The division posted strong trading revenue, though well short of the blow-out profits during the first half of the year when the markets were in constant flux. The business of arranging financing for corporations and advising on deals fell off in the last part of the year, though Mr. Cavanagh said there were signs of a rebound in the first two weeks of January.

As the investment bank’s income surged, the amount of money set aside for compensation in that division rose by almost one-third, to about $9.3 billion for 2009. But JPMorgan officials cut the portion of revenue they put in the bonus pool by almost half from last year.

The division, which employs about 25,000 people, reduced the share of revenue going to the compensation pool, to 37 percent by midyear, from 40 percent in the first quarter. The share fell to 11 percent in the fourth quarter because of the impact of the British bonus tax and the greater use of stock awards.

Bank officials have said that they needed to reward the firm’s standout performance, but to show restraint before a public outraged over banker pay. Other Wall Street firms may make similarly large adjustments.

Chase’s corporate bank, meanwhile, booked a $1.3 billion profit this year, even as it recorded losses on commercial real estate loans. Still, that represents a smaller portion of the bank’s overall balance sheet compared with many regional and community lenders. JPMorgan’s asset management business and treasury services units each booked similar profits for 2009.
467 2010-01-16 Strasbourg has provided an international platform for hundreds of cases damaging to the government. One of the most damaging had been expected to grab attention on Thursday, the day of the first hearing in a $100 billion lawsuit filed by the former managers of Yukos, the oil company once run by the imprisoned oligarch Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.

The court said Tuesday that the hearing would be delayed for a third time, until March 4, because two Russian representatives would not be available. One became ill, and the other was needed to address the Parliament before the ratification vote, said Karinna Moskalenko, one of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s lawyers.

Leaders of the Council of Europe, which established the human rights court, worked hard to convince Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and President Dmitri A. Medvedev that the reforms “had become a key link in the relationship,” said Thomas Hammarberg, the human rights commissioner at the council. Russia will be held to the same rules that apply to other members, and no changes were made to the protocol during negotiations.

“What they probably feel is that they have been listened to — their concerns have been heard,” Mr. Hammarberg said. “I think it has been more of a political process than a juridical process.”

But Mr. Vyatkin said the council had provided written commitments on the Russians’ main fears. He said he was reassured that Russian judges would be included in reviews of potential cases against Russia, that the court would not begin investigating complaints before cases were formally accepted and that the court would not have new powers to force rulings to be carried out.

He said his European colleagues had ignored Russians’ complaints for years. “The main thing is, we explained to our colleagues that ultimatums will not solve anyone’s problems,” he said. “Let’s talk. It is already clear that without Russian participation, the Council of Europe will be of no use to anyone.”

Aleksei V. Makarkin, a leading analyst at the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow policy research group, said such compromises could have been reached at any time in the last four years. What has changed, he said, is the atmosphere in Moscow. “We have begun to change our relationship to the West,” Mr. Makarkin said. “We no longer have the feeling that Europe wants to build revolutions here.”

In terms of domestic politics, he added, “I would put it in the context of very careful, very gradual steps toward liberalization.”

472 2010-01-17 Once fun and glamorous, air travel has turned into a slog of security rules, long waits and cramped limbs. Partly this is because so many more people fly today. In 1940, passenger planes in the United States carried only 3 million people, compared with 17 million in 1950 and about 650 million in 2008, according to FareCompare.com, an airline ticket research site for consumers.

Keep in mind, too, that in the early 1980s, shortly after airline industry deregulation, many of the cheaper domestic round-trip tickets sold for $250 to $300, and the same is still true today, said Rick Seaney, C.E.O. of FareCompare.com . So, adjusted for inflation, the cost of air travel has actually fallen.

475 2010-01-17 ITHACA, N.Y. — Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said earlier in the week that he would seed the Cornell basketball team from a No. 4 to a No. 6 seed in this year’s N.C.A.A. tournament.

The two-time defending Ivy League champion Big Red has victories this season at Alabama, at Massachusetts and at St. John’s. The team also led Kansas, then ranked No. 1, late in a near-upset in Lawrence, Kan., on Jan. 6.

Cornell opened Ivy League play Saturday by routing Columbia, 74-53, showing why it is the heavy favorite for a third consecutive league title.

“This is the best team they’ve had since I’ve been here,” Columbia Coach Joe Jones said. “No question.”

The senior Ryan Wittman and the sophomore Chris Wroblewski led Cornell with 13 points each, and the senior center Jeff Foote added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Cornell jumped out to a 24-8 lead and was never threatened.

476 2010-01-17 FARGO, N.D. (AP) — Some University of North Dakota officials were hoping that a long-running dispute over the university’s Fighting Sioux nickname would be settled this week. Now it appears it could continue for several months.

A state judge ruled last month that the North Dakota Board of Higher Education has the power to drop the Fighting Sioux nickname before a November deadline set as part of a settlement with the N.C.A.A. The board scheduled a meeting this week to officially retire the moniker. But Patrick Morley, the lawyer for a Spirit Lake Sioux group that sued to keep the nickname, filed an appeal late Friday to the state Supreme Court.

North Dakota officials are hoping to get their teams into the Summit League, but the conference president, Tom Douple, said the university would not be considered for admission until it found a solution that made the N.C.A.A. happy.

The nickname issue has been debated since the 1990s. Nearly five years ago, North Dakota was placed on a list of universities the N.C.A.A. deemed to have “hostile or abusive” American Indian nicknames or logos. North Dakota is the only college on that list that has not changed the name or logo or been granted a waiver to keep them.

The Spirit Lake group and other nickname supporters hope a delay will give North Dakota a chance to get approval from the state’s two namesake tribes. A referendum last April on the Spirit Lake Sioux reservation gave overwhelming support for the nickname, but the Standing Rock Sioux tribal council has opposed it, and the tribe has not scheduled a referendum.
477 2010-01-17 Assessing the recession’s impact on families, the Census Bureau said Friday that unemployment rates for couples with children under age 18 had doubled from 2007 to 2009.

The increase was higher for two-parent families than for single parents, according to figures from the March 2009 Current Population Survey.

The loss of jobs also meant that the percentage of couples with children in which both parents had jobs declined, more often than not because the husband was out of work.

In 2007, in 67 percent of those married-couple households, both parents worked. By 2009, the percentage had declined to 59 percent.

The decline was greater among black and Hispanic couples than non-Hispanic white ones. Among those black couples, 12 percent reported that only the wife was employed, the highest of any of the ethnic and racial groups measured.

479 2010-01-17 Re “Multicultural Critical Theory. At B-School?” (Jan. 10), which said business schools were realizing that their students need “to think critically and creatively every bit as much as they need to learn finance or accounting.”

Like other students, those studying for M.B.A.’s should of course be challenged to “think through clashing priorities and potential options rather than hewing to any preplanned strategy.” As a professor of chemistry at a major research university, I am constantly challenging graduate students to think critically and creatively and to revise their thinking in light of new information.

If these challenges were missing in business schools, it’s no surprise that their students could have helped lead us into our current financial mess.

The writer is a chemistry professor at the University of Washington.

Although I am now retired, I promoted the cause of expanding critical and comparative thinking from the humanities to practical business when I taught business ethics and comparative ethics at Temple University.

Critical thinking creates a shield against weapons of mass suggestion and emotional indoctrination in business, politics and the mass media. It also expands open-mindedness about opposing and complementary perspectives.

When television viewers are bombarded with media hype, for example, they should remember that if they keep control of their own thinking and feeling, they will create their own reflections and solutions — not imitatively, but innovatively.
480 2010-01-17 “This is going to make me rethink it,” Stone said. “I was operating under the assumption that he was juicing, but I couldn’t know for certain. Now that I do, I would say I’m leaning against him. It’s a very difficult decision.”

Twenty-six respondents said they had never voted for McGwire and did not expect to change their minds, although many reserved that right. Nine, or 26 percent, said they had voted for him, and all but Stone said they probably would continue to do so. Before McGwire’s confession, one who had left him off the ballot eventually voted for him.

“The reason I didn’t vote for him before is because I suspected he used steroids during his career,” Tim Brown of Yahoo Sports said. “Now that he’s confirmed it, I won’t be changing the vote.”

Most voters contacted, including those who voted for McGwire, said the confession was hardly a revelation.

“I didn’t learn anything today that I didn’t know yesterday,” Joel Sherman of The New York Post said the day McGwire went public. Sherman said he had not voted for McGwire and did not intend to in the future.

Nor does Ken Rosenthal of Foxsports.com, who expressed a common theme. He and others see McGwire as a one-dimensional player, and that one dimension was artificially supplemented.

“His is a flawed candidacy,” Rosenthal said. “It is built on his power, and his power was based on performance-enhancing drugs. I don’t rule out changing my mind in the future, but I’m not sure why I would.”

McGwire, who is the St. Louis Cardinals’ new hitting coach, has been on the ballot four times since he retired after the 2001 season and has received almost the same support each time. He totaled 128 votes in 2007 (23.5 percent) and in 2008 (23.6), 118 (21.9) in 2009, and 128 again this year (23.7). Seventy-five percent of the vote is needed to gain entrance to the Hall of Fame, so McGwire seems unlikely to reach that level anytime soon.

Although the use of performance-enhancing drugs is an issue, McGwire faces another challenge to enshrinement. Some voters said his play just did not warrant election. McGwire hit 583 home runs with a .263 batting average, and many have compared him to a glorified Dave Kingman.

“I wasn’t voting for him based on his performance on the field,” said Susan Slusser, who covers the Oakland Athletics for The San Francisco Chronicle. “Now that he’s admitted to using steroids, he gets the double whammy from me.”

For those voting in favor of McGwire, the reasons are multilayered. Some said it was impractical for voters to judge the moral character of players and naïve to assume that everyone in the Hall was an angelic figure.

Others said that if the so-called clean players did not stand up to the cheats, why should the voters protect them now? Some struggled with the seemingly impossible task of sorting the cheats from the clean players in an era saturated with drug use.

And if this is indeed the steroid era, McGwire still rose high above most of the others, including some pitchers who threw the pitches he hit.

“Cheating is a way of life in baseball,” said Bruce Jenkins of The San Francisco Chronicle, who covered McGwire in the early days of his career in Oakland. “It has been since the game was invented. You can’t change that. You can’t turn it into ‘Ozzie and Harriet.’ My vote for McGwire is a vote for baseball, and those who truly stand out.”

But as fraught as McGwire’s candidacy may be, it becomes more difficult in the coming years when some players who have been linked to performance-enhancing drugs — Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, for instance — become eligible.

With that in mind, several respondents expressed anguish over the process, including Phil Rogers of The Chicago Tribune, who said he might stop voting. Rick Hummel of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who covered McGwire during his four and a half years as a player with the Cardinals, has voted for him since he appeared on the ballot. Now Hummel does not seem quite as certain.

“It’s really changing, now,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t think I want to vote at all.”
481 2010-01-17 Slightly more than 1,000 pedestrians visited emergency rooms in 2008 because they got distracted and tripped, fell or ran into something while using a cellphone to talk or text. That was twice the number from 2007, which had nearly doubled from 2006, according to a study conducted by , which says it is the first to estimate such accidents.

“It’s the tip of the iceberg,” said Jack L. Nasar, a professor of city and regional planning at Ohio State, noting that the number of mishaps is probably much higher considering that most of the injuries are not severe enough to require a hospital visit. What is more, he said, texting is rising sharply and devices like the have thousands of new, engaging applications to preoccupy phone users.

Mr. Nasar supervised the statistical analysis, which was done by Derek Troyer, one of his graduate students. He looked at records of emergency room visits compiled by the .

Examples of such visits include a 16-year-old boy who walked into a telephone pole while texting and suffered a ; a 28-year-old man who tripped and fractured a finger on the hand gripping his cellphone; and a 68-year-old man who fell off the porch while talking on a cellphone, spraining a thumb and an ankle and causing .

Young people injured themselves more often. About half the visits Mr. Troyer studied were by people under 30, and a quarter were 16 to 20 years old. But more than a quarter of those injured were 41 to 60 years old.

Pedestrians, like drivers, have long been distracted by myriad tasks, like snacking or reading on the go. But the constant interaction with electronic devices has made single-tasking seem boring or even unproductive.

Cognitive , neurologists and other researchers are beginning to study the impact of constant multitasking, whether behind a desk or the wheel or on foot. It might stand to reason that someone looking at a phone to read a message would misstep, but the researchers are finding that just talking on a phone takes its own considerable toll on cognition and awareness.

Sometimes, pedestrians using their phones do not notice objects or people that are right in front of them — even a clown riding a unicycle. That was the finding of a recent study at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash., by a professor, Ira Hyman, and his students.

One of the students dressed as a clown and unicycled around a central square on campus. About half the people walking past by themselves said they had seen the clown, and the number was slightly higher for people walking in pairs. But only 25 percent of people talking on a cellphone said they had, Mr. Hyman said.

He said the term commonly applied to such preoccupation is “inattention ,” meaning a person can be looking at an object but fail to register it or process what it is.

Particularly fascinating, Mr. Hyman said, is that people walking in pairs were more than twice as likely to see the clown as were people talking on a cellphone, suggesting that the act of simply having a conversation is not the cause of inattention blindness.

One possible explanation is that a cellphone conversation not just auditory resources in the brain but also visual functions, said Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at the . That combination, he said, prompts the listener to, for example, create visual imagery related to the conversation in a way that overrides or obscures the processing of real images.

By comparison, walking and chewing gum (that age-old measure of pedestrian skill at multitasking) is a snap.

“Walking and chewing are repetitive, well-practiced tasks that become automatic,” Dr. Gazzaley said. “They don’t compete for resources like texting and walking.”

Further, he said, the cellphone gives people a constant opportunity to pursue goals that feel more important than walking down the street.

“An animal would never walk into a pole,” he said, noting survival instincts would trump other priorities.

For Shalamar Jones, 19, the priority was keeping in touch with her boyfriend. Last month while she was Christmas shopping in a mall near , she was texting him when — bam! — she walked into the window of a store, thinking it was a door.

“I thought it was open,” she said, noting that no harm was done. “I just started laughing at myself.”

The worst part is the humiliation, said Christopher Black, 20, an art student at San Francisco State University who 18 months ago had his own pratfall.

At the time, Mr. Black said, the sidewalks were packed with pedestrians. So he decided he could move faster if he walked in the street, keeping close to the parked cars. The trouble is he was also texting — with a woman he was flirting with.

He unwittingly started to veer into the road, prompting an oncoming car to honk. He said he instinctively jumped toward the sidewalk but, in the process, forgot about the line of parked cars.

“I splayed against the side of the car, and the phone hit the ground,” he said. He and his phone were uninjured, except for his pride. “It was pretty significantly embarrassing.”
482 2010-01-17 There are about a billion squatters in the world today, and over time many have transformed their once-squalid communities into normal urban neighborhoods. In the awful aftermath of the tremor that turned hundreds of thousands of Haitians into refugees in their own hometown, a few sensible squatter principles may hold out hope for the devastated residents of Port-au-Prince:

 Squatting is not a crime. Rather than being put in refugee camps, people can seize the initiative and squat in their old communities, without aid groups clamping down on them. This doesn’t mean occupying unsafe houses, but erecting new shacks nearby. This way, families can share food, shelter and skills. And these nascent communities — self-organized and temporary at first — can serve as the building blocks of new neighborhoods.

 Scavenging is not wrong. In Mumbai, India, squatters build and rebuild their homes one wall at a time using materials that they find on the side of the road. Billboards, fence posts, bricks picked up from construction sites, scarred wooden panels: these are all incredibly valuable resources.

 Not all theft is criminal. Looting is wrong, but lifting necessities like water or electricity is not. In Rio de Janeiro’s favelas, squatters steal from the city’s water mains and connect them directly to their homes using electric pumps (they pilfer the electricity, too) and long lines of plastic pipe. If any of Port-au-Prince’s water system or electric grid has survived, shouldn’t people be allowed to tap into them?

 Self-reliant networks are key. In the favelas, families will join to create a mutirão — mutual construction society — and build their homes together. In Kibera, the largest mud hut community in Nairobi, Kenya, women form “merry-go-rounds” to pool their money. In Lagos, Nigeria, every illegal market has a self-governing association. In Istanbul, squatter communities have elected governments that establish planning and zoning principles. Local cooperative efforts like these can help make rebuilding and recovery possible in Haiti.
483 2010-01-17 During the fiscal crisis of the 1970s, when big development projects in New York City were suspended, many New Yorkers decided to save their city by preserving it.

“Properties that may have been torn down, or improved, or replaced, were still there,” said Jeffrey A. Kroessler, a longtime city preservationist. “Citizens embraced preservation as a way of bringing the city back to life. So when recovery came, instead of the city bulldozing properties, as they might have done in the past, there was a very active dialogue between the citizens and developers.”

The current recession has made for another development lull, but preservationists say developers are still active behind the scenes. “In the down times, we still see developers lining up the permits for demolition, alteration permits, chiseling details off buildings so they can’t be landmarked,” said Kate Wood, executive director of Landmark West, a nonprofit preservation group. “Just because we don’t see a lot of buildings going up doesn’t mean older buildings aren’t still at risk.”

Of particular concern to city preservationists is the block-size Hudson River Powerhouse on far West 59th Street, built in 1904 by the architecture firm McKim, Mead & White. The building is not threatened with demolition; it is owned by Con Edison and still provides the utility’s customers with steam. But Con Edison has consistently resisted efforts to landmark the building, saying the designation would be too restrictive, and removed the last original smokestack earlier this year, to preservationists’ alarm.
484 2010-01-17 All of the ketchup and mustard bottles at Corey’s Catsup and Mustard are labeled Heinz. The hamburgers, though, are housemade, ground from beef every day, formed into slightly irregular, seven-ounce patties and cooked to order.

Corey’s is decidedly family-friendly. Lighting is bright and cheerful, the color scheme emphasizes yellow and red, television screens anchor each corner of the linear space, and only one item on the menu — the Buried Under Cheeseburger salad — costs more than $10.

Corey’s serves a dozen different burgers, with the most basic complemented by lettuce, tomato and one of six cheeses. More of a mouthful is the Chipotle Blue Cheese Bacon Double Stuffed, though some may find the chipotle pepper influence too restrained. There’s nothing restrained, however, about the Seven-Napkin Burger, which is loaded with double patties, barbecued beef brisket, bacon, American cheese and mayonnaise (burgers cost from $6.25 to $9.25, including dill pickle and vinegared slaw).

Although other offerings consist mostly of familiar pub grub, there are a few interesting twists, like sweet potato fries paired with wasabi mustard, miniburgers with bruschetta and crispy boneless chicken wings ($5.25 to $8.50). You’ll also find chili, topped with cheddar and red onions, and a crab and corn bisque ($4.50 to $4.75).

In addition to that Buried Under Cheeseburger, beneath a heap of romaine, tomatoes and more ($11.25), salads include classic Caesar, Cobb and Waldorf and start at $3.75. There are sandwiches, too, as well as a teriyaki salmon wrap and herb-grilled chicken on a pretzel bun. Just don’t forget the crispy golden fries, which may be the tastiest this side of Belgium ($1.75).

485 2010-01-17 In addition to citing Babe Ruth, Steven Brill would have done well to appeal to J. P. Morgan, who, a generation earlier, reportedly believed that no chief executive should earn more than 20 times the wage of the lowest-paid worker. Such executives were likelier to focus on their own wealth than on the health of their companies.

The reckless behavior of executives earning as much as 275 times the average worker’s wage has proved Morgan right. Banks should be induced to return to sensible lending practices and to proper credit analysis through the imposition of penalties for breaking Morgan’s rule: namely, huge reserve requirements and high F.D.I.C. insurance premiums. If banks were subject to such discipline, bankers’ salaries would naturally fall from the stratosphere in which they currently soar. Boulder, Colo.

The air of unreality that pervades the practice of executive compensation also pervades the discussion of Kenneth Feinberg’s achievements in Steven Brill’s article. There is no awareness that the success of these firms depends not only on top management and the traders, but also on the other members of the firm. We need to take seriously the idea that a corporation’s success is contributed to by every member of the organization — from workers on the shop floor to the executive team. Yes, each makes a differential contribution and this should be reflected in their base salaries. But when it comes to bonuses based on the firm’s performance, let each share the same percentage. In dollar terms, the differential will be there, but each will be rewarded for the firm’s success. This form of compensation seems like a good norm for firms, powerful shareholders and compensation committees to take on. It is a pity that Feinberg did not adopt this principle.

Rachel Aviv’s article opens with Laura J. Sloate and how she functions in a sighted world. I’m glad that Sloate is happy with the direction literacy has gone for her, but I’m disappointed that she feels her experience will become the norm for all people with severe visual impairments. Some students are not as auditory and need the tactile qualities of Braille to help them learn to read, to remember and to reread as needed.

491 2010-01-18 “Just Kids,” writes Janet Maslin, captures a moment when Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe “were young, inseparable, perfectly bohemian and completely unknown.” The “tenderly evocative memoir” by Ms. Smith, the punk-rock queen, chronicles her early relationship with the photographer. Ms. Smith came across Mr. Mapplethorpe in a back bedroom of a Brooklyn apartment. He “resembled a hippie shepherd,” while she “had been contemptuously described as looking like ‘Dracula’s daughter,’ ” Ms. Maslin writes. They would go on to “become roommates, soul mates, friends, lovers and muses.” On Tuesday night, starting at 7 p.m., Ms. Smith will read about those bygone days at the Barnes & Noble at Union Square.

500 2010-01-18 If anything, he seemed reluctant to be back. “I frankly don’t miss the limelight,” he said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “I’m glad to help out, but there’s life after the presidency, is what I’ve learned, and I’m going to live it to the fullest. And this is part of living it to the fullest, to help other people.”

Some former aides said Mr. Bush agreed with a lot of what Mr. Cheney had said about Mr. Obama’s policies, but found the idea of speaking out himself distasteful. He has asked some who have visited him in Dallas what they thought of the way Mr. Cheney has conducted himself, but he does not offer his own views to many, even in private.

“He didn’t like it when he was president when former presidents criticized the actions of their successor,” said Karen Hughes, a longtime adviser. The Bush team resents “a lot of unfair blame thrown at him in the last year,” she said, adding that “I’m sure he appreciates it when people try to set the record straight.” But, she said, “I don’t remember him saying to any of us to do or not to do that.”

Instead, Mr. Bush has focused on building his presidential library and a policy institute to advance priorities like education, global health, freedom and economic growth. He gave 32 speeches in 2009 and is finishing the first draft of a book he is writing. His institute has scheduled four conferences for March and April on issues like women in Afghanistan and natural gas.

The Haiti project puts him in the same role he asked his father and Mr. Clinton to play after the Asian tsunami of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The first President Bush told Mr. Clinton last year that if another such project came up, “I’m passing the mantle to my son,” according to Douglas J. Band, Mr. Clinton’s counselor. After the earthquake in Haiti, the younger Mr. Bush quickly signed up. “He didn’t even think about it before saying yes,” Mr. Band said.

Mr. Bush’s first visit back to the White House may have been a little awkward, but he made jokes and played with Mr. Obama’s dog. “He was very relaxed, very jovial and joking around with everybody, self-deprecating as always,” Mr. Band added.

During the Sunday television interviews, Mr. Bush expressed grief for Haiti’s victims. “I feel sick to my stomach,” he said on “Fox News Sunday,” and noted that a member of his church had died there. His lesson from Hurricane Katrina was that it takes time to move in supplies. “There’s an expectation among people that things are going to happen quickly,” he said on “Meet the Press” on NBC, “and sometimes it’s hard to make things happen quickly.”

Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton called each other Bill and George, and Mr. Bush joked that his mother “calls him my fourth brother.”

“When you’re both retired,” Mr. Bush said on “This Week” on ABC, “you kind of hang around the retirement center together, and so he and I have become friends.”
501 2010-01-18 Nonetheless, the result was a crushing setback for the leftist coalition that had steered Chile out of the 17-year dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and helped build democracy while maintaining economic stability.

Voters not only overcame their fears of the right’s ties to the dictatorship, but they also rejected the candidate supported by an extraordinarily popular leftist president, Michelle Bachelet. Despite having approval ratings hovering around 75 percent, she was unable to transfer her popularity to Mr. Frei, whom many voters saw as a re-tread and whose campaign was unable to keep up with Mr. Piñera’s slick, well-financed effort.

Mr. Piñera has positioned himself as an experienced business leader but is not expected to make any striking changes in the country’s economic policies.

In his victory speech, Mr. Piñera paid tribute to the previous government and vowed not to “start from zero, but to start a new era in the development of our country.” And in a televised telephone call, he called Ms. Bachelet late Sunday to thank her for her service and to invite her to breakfast Monday morning to seek her “advice.”

Chile’s third-richest citizen, Mr. Piñera has a financial empire that includes a controlling interest in the country’s largest airline, Lan; a major television channel; and a stake in Chile’s most popular soccer team. He has said he would divest his holdings in Lan if elected.

During the campaign, Mr. Piñera boasted that he would create one million new jobs and crack down on delinquency and drug trafficking. He also said he would seek to privatize a part of Codelco, Chile’s state-owned copper company and the world’s largest copper producer.

Like Mr. Frei, he vowed to carry on some of the social programs that Ms. Bachelet put in place, including an expansion of child care and social assistance for nonworking mothers.

Although some members of Mr. Piñera’s coalition served in the Pinochet cabinet, the president-elect has said he will not allow former members of the Pinochet government to serve in his cabinet. Mr. Piñera’s brother, José Piñera, helped install the nation’s neo-liberal economic program as the general’s labor minister and today is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington.

After toppling the Socialist government of Salvador Allende in 1973 in a bloody coup, General Pinochet violently thrust the country to the right. More than 3,000 leftists were killed or disappeared, leaving a bitter memory that had kept conservatives out of power ever since.

That fear still worked in Mr. Frei’s favor on Sunday.

“This was one of the most difficult decisions the country has had in a long time,” said Erica Tapia, 44. “Unfortunately, I voted for Frei out of fear of the right.”

Ms. Bachelet could not seek re-election because the Constitution allows only one four-year term and no direct re-election. Analysts believe she could win again in 2014 if she runs.

But dissatisfaction with her coalition was evident in the first round of voting in December, when Mr. Piñera won 44 percent of the vote and an independent candidate, Marco Enríquez-Ominami, won 20 percent. Mr. Enríquez-Ominami, a former Socialist, tapped into the desire for a break with the old with a campaign against politics as usual.
502 2010-01-18 The officials also cited lapses and misjudgments that were not disclosed in the declassified government report released Jan. 7 about what went wrong inside the nation’s counterterrorism network.

In September, for example, a United Nations expert on Al Qaeda warned policy makers in Washington that the type of explosive device used by a Yemeni militant in an assassination attempt in Saudi Arabia could be carried aboard an airliner.

In early November, American intelligence authorities say they learned from a communications intercept of Qaeda followers in Yemen that a man named “Umar Farouk” — the first two names of the jetliner suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab — had volunteered for a coming operation.

In late December, more intercepts of Qaeda operatives in Yemen, who had previously focused their attacks in the region, mentioned the date of Dec. 25, and suggested that they were “looking for ways to get somebody out” or “for ways to move people to the West,” one senior administration official said.

And the same day those White House meetings on terrorist activities took place, a Qaeda figure made ominous — and seemingly prescient — threats against the United States.

“We carry prayer beads, and with them we carry a bomb for the enemies of God,” a man describing himself as a Qaeda fighter from Yemen announced in a video released on Al Jazeera satellite television. “The issue is between us and America and its allies, and beware, those who stand in the ranks of America.”

The American intelligence network was clearly listening in Yemen and sharing that information, a sign of progress since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Yet the inability to pull the data together or correctly interpret it produced the “systemic failure” that Mr. Obama has vowed to fix and that Congress will examine in hearings this week.

The criticism of the government’s performance has provoked infighting, with rival agencies privately pointing at one another and some intelligence officials complaining about what they see as a White House attempt to deflect responsibility.

Top White House officials, already warning Americans about the possibility of more Qaeda terrorist plots, say they have little patience for squabbling.

“We had a system in place to capture these nuggets because of the investment we put into the collection system,” Mr. Brennan said in an interview. “We had the ability to map it against a database that was designed specifically to capture that bio data information. We had those pieces in place.

“And we could have brought it together, and we should have brought it together. And that is what upset the president.”

The blast that ricocheted last August through the office of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia took only one life — that of the young suicide bomber sent by Al Qaeda in Yemen. But the assassination attempt set off alarms both in the Middle East and in Washington.

From the start of the Obama administration, American officials had been focused on the growing threat in Yemen, where Qaeda operatives from Saudi Arabia and Yemen had recently merged and created a dangerous alliance dubbed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

The attack against Prince Nayef, who is the country’s chief counterterrorism official, showed that the new group’s ambitions were growing and spurred warnings about the explosive’s usefulness as an aviation threat. Mr. Brennan flew to Saudi Arabia within a week to see him, and the United States swiftly increased its electronic eavesdropping and other spying in Yemen. It also intensified a diplomatic effort to prod Yemen’s leaders to strike back at the militants.

A second alarm came in early November, when Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 12 soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas. Over the previous year, American investigators said, Major Hasan had sent more than a dozen e-mail messages to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical, American-born cleric living in Yemen. After ordering a review of any contacts between other possible extremists and Mr. Awlaki, American authorities began collecting more intelligence, officials said.

And some of the tips were increasingly alarming. Qaeda operatives in Yemen were caught discussing an “Umar Farouk” who had recently been in contact with Mr. Awlaki about volunteering for terrorist operations, one official said. American intelligence officials learned of the conversation in November, although it had been intercepted by a foreign intelligence service in August, an administration official said.

The National Security Agency intercepted a second phone conversation in November involving Qaeda members in Yemen, in which they discussed an unnamed Nigerian man who was being groomed for an operation. (Mr. Abdulmutallab is Nigerian.) The next month, intelligence officials eavesdropped on Qaeda operatives who talked of sending a militant toward the West to carry out a strike.

Other intercepted conversations mentioned a significant event on Christmas Day, although it was unclear if the event concerned a strike against an American target or a movement of Qaeda backers, perhaps motivated by the deadly raids that Yemeni forces began in mid-December, officials said.

In the final weeks of the year, American intelligence officials, using spy satellites and communication intercepts, were intently focused on pinpointing the location of Qaeda fighters so the Yemeni military could strike them. By doing so, the American officials hoped to prevent attacks on the United States Embassy in Yemen, personnel or other targets in the region with American ties.

Yet they had unwittingly left themselves vulnerable, American officials now concede. Counterterrorism officials assumed that the militants were not sophisticated or ambitious enough to send operatives into the United States. And no one shifted more intelligence analysts to the task, so that they could have supported the military assaults by Yemen while also scrutinizing all incoming tips for hints about future attacks against Americans, one administration official said.

So, though intelligence analysts had enough information in those days before Christmas to block the suicide bomber on the Northwest flight, they did not act.

“We didn’t know they had progressed to the point of actually launching individuals here,” Mr. Brennan said on Jan. 7 at a White House briefing.

An administration official added, “The puzzle pieces were not being fitted to any type of homeland plot.”

The overhaul of America’s intelligence apparatus in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks was intended to break information logjams and ensure that spy agencies traded secrets with one another. It established redundant layers of terrorism analysts to ensure that disparate clues to the next attack would not be ignored or overlooked.

But in the weeks before Christmas, the flaws in the structure were laid bare. No single person or unit was in charge of running down every high-priority tip.

At the National Counterterrorism Center just outside Washington, where specialists can draw on streams of information from more than 80 databases across the government, two teams of intelligence analysts worked on different parts of the same problem. Yet they never collaborated to piece together clues about the Christmas Day attack that were coming in.

A group of “watch list analysts” had been told by the United States Embassy in Nigeria that Mr. Abdulmutallab had been reported missing by his father and was likely to be under “the influence of religious extremists based in Yemen.”

But American officials in Nigeria did not flag Mr. Abdulmutallab for closer scrutiny, and alarms were not raised with the American Embassy in Yemen, either. Inside their electronic files, which contain tips on tens of thousands of cases, the analysts at the counterterrorism center also had a draft C.I.A. memorandum with biographical information about the man.

These tips were enough for the team, made up of about two dozen specialists, to add Mr. Abdulmutallab into the so-called Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, a tally of 550,000 people worldwide who might be a threat to the United States. The analysts, though, had missed the other threads of information sitting in their computer systems, so they did not put him in a more restrictive database that could have resulted in his inclusion on a “no fly” list.

The second team, a cadre of about 300 “all-source analysts,” failed to make the link as well. They are supposed to be the deep thinkers charged with preparing long-term assessments of terrorist groups, their financing and recruiting methods and their leadership. But officials said that while dozens of such analysts were examining the Yemen threat, they failed to repeatedly scrutinize the raw intelligence for hints of a possible attack on the United States originating in Yemen.

Obama administration officials now say the counterterrorism center needs personnel assigned solely to follow up on all tips, acting like detectives who keep working cases until they are solved.

The analysts are stymied, however, by computer systems that cannot easily search automatically — and repeatedly — for possible links, officials said. Even simple keyword searches are a challenge, according to a 2008 report by investigators for the House Committee on Science and Technology.

“The program not only can’t connect the dots, it can’t find the dots,” Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina and chairman of a House panel that oversees the program, said at the time.

At the C.I.A, some of the information that had been collected was not widely distributed. A draft memorandum on Mr. Abdulmutallab circulated through the agency, with information added by officers inside its Africa division and its counterterrorism center.

But on Christmas Day, the final draft of the memorandum was still sitting in the computer of a junior C.I.A. analyst, waiting until a photo of the young Nigerian was located. Unbeknownst to the analyst, officials said, Mr. Abdulmutallab’s photo had already been delivered to other counterterrorism agencies.

“There were so many things that could have altered the course of events,” one senior administration official said.

The fallout from the terrorist plot has already exposed some simmering tensions, complicating the government’s ability fix the problems.

One senior Obama official faulted Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, for failing to assign extra intelligence analysts to focus on Yemen while also hunting for possible emerging threats to the United States.

For their part, some senior intelligence officials bristled at what they saw as a White House effort to place blame for the breakdowns solely on American spy agencies.

Mr. Blair fought back after early drafts of the White House report on the bombing attempt did not, in his view, adequately acknowledge the difficulties of placing a name on travel watch lists, according to two government officials. The report’s release was delayed several hours, and Mr. Blair managed to get changes made to the final version.

The tensions have also added to the concern expressed by influential lawmakers, who said they were told by administration officials last week in a briefing that the United States believes that Al Qaeda in Yemen could use other young men like Mr. Abdulmutallab as suicide bombers aboard aircraft.

“We don’t know how many more individuals are still out there that were trained by this radical cleric in Yemen,” said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security intelligence subcommittee, “and may be still trying to pull off the same stunt.”
503 2010-01-18 SEATTLE — Investors in technology start-ups have been trying to end the drought in initial public offerings of tech companies. But for entrepreneurs, has taking a company public lost its allure?

That question is growing louder among those who start, invest in and advise Silicon Valley start-ups. “I.P.O. has become a bad word in the Valley,” said Richard Barton, a founder and the chief executive of Zillow.com, a real estate site, and a venture partner at Benchmark Capital.

When start-ups grow up, the founders pay back their investors by selling the business to a bigger company or selling shares to the public. Public offerings have long been the more desirable option. They earn the founders and investors more money and the promise of continuing returns, and enable them to keep expanding the company.

Still, in a survey of start-ups by the venture capital firm DCM, only 19 percent said they expected to go public. Three-quarters said a major barrier was stricter regulations for public companies.

“People don’t want to run public companies anymore because they don’t want to get dragged through the mud,” said Rob Coneybeer, a managing director at the investment firm Shasta Ventures. “They’re so focused on paperwork that they can’t focus on building a business.”
504 2010-01-18 One problem with “Be Good Johnny Weir,” a Sundance Channel documentary series about the efforts of Mr. Weir, the figure skater, to climb back to the top of the sport, is that it will be irrelevant by the time it has its premiere on Monday. The pivotal competition, the nationals, which the series will finally get to in March, was held over the weekend in Spokane, Wash. Anyone who cares enough about skating to watch this show will already know whether Mr. Weir did well enough to make the Olympic team, his goal.

So the real question is whether Mr. Weir’s story is compelling enough to be of interest even if he failed in his quest for one last shot at glory. (He is 25, old for a skater.) And here again there’s a problem: For people who follow the sport, Mr. Weir, flamboyant and a nonstop publicity machine, is by now overexposed.

Which leads to a paradox: People who will most enjoy “Be Good Johnny Weir” are those who don’t follow figure skating. That is especially true of the opening installment, “Pop Star on Ice,” a movie-length treatment of Mr. Weir’s career through 2008.

We see the young skater, relatively new to the sport, winning his first major title at 16, but then going into the 2006 Olympics with high expectations and failing. And we see the painful arc of his relationship with his longtime coach, Priscilla Hill, who nurtures him for a decade but by the episode’s end has been replaced. By next Monday’s episode Galina Zmievskaya, a formidable Russian woman, has taken over the coaching role and is trying to get Mr. Weir to master the difficult quadruple jump.

There is drama in the series: the relationship with the tough new coach; a roommate issue in Mr. Weir’s private life; the recurring rivalry with another American skater, Evan Lysacek. Whether that’s enough to hold your interest will depend on your personal Weir tolerance level.
505 2010-01-18 In “Just Kids” Ms. Smith writes of becoming pregnant at 19 (“I was humbled by nature”) in New Jersey, giving up her baby and heading to New York for a fresh start. Describing herself as “I, the country mouse,” she writes of heading to Brooklyn to visit friends and discovering that those friends had moved away.

In a back bedroom of their former apartment she encountered Mapplethorpe for the first time: “a sleeping youth cloaked in light,” a beautiful young man who resembled a hippie shepherd at a time when Ms. Smith had been contemptuously described as looking like “Dracula’s daughter.”

Thus fate introduced Ms. Smith and Mapplethorpe, who would become roommates, soul mates, friends, lovers and muses. Strictly speaking they were never starving artists in a garret, but the romanticism and mythmaking of “Just Kids,” and their tenancy in the tiniest room at the Chelsea Hotel, brings them pretty close to that ideal.

They went to museums able to afford only one ticket. (The one who saw the exhibition would describe it to the one who waited outside.) They went to Coney Island, able to afford only one hot dog. (Ms. Smith got the sauerkraut.) They loved the same totems and ornaments and flourishes; they valued the same things, though in different ways. “We were both praying for Robert’s soul,” Ms. Smith writes of Mapplethorpe’s frank ambition — especially when he fell under the influence of Warhol, someone she deeply mistrusted — “he to sell it and I to save it.” She goes on to suggest caustically that it was his prayers that were answered.

But much of “Just Kids” unfolds before Mapplethorpe did the taboo-busting, shock-laden photographic work for which he is best remembered. (“I admired him for it, but I could not comprehend the brutality,” Ms. Smith writes of his sadomasochistic imagery.) And it occurs before his illness. (He died of AIDS in 1989.) Of the two of them it was Ms. Smith who made her mark first. Like “Chronicles,” “Just Kids” carries its author to the verge of fame but stops right there on the brink, so that its innocence is never compromised by circumstances too surreal or hagiographic for the reader. This book achieves its aura of the sacrosanct by insisting that the later, more doomy and fraught part of Ms. Smith’s life story belongs elsewhere.

It’s possible to come away from “Just Kids” with an intact image of the title’s childlike kindred spirits who listened to Tim Hardin’s delicate love songs, wondered if they could afford the extra 10 cents for chocolate milk and treasured each geode, tambourine or silver skull they shared, never wanting what they couldn’t have or unduly caring what the future might bring. If it sometimes sounds like a fairy tale, it also conveys a heartbreakingly clear idea of why Ms. Smith is entitled to tell one.

So she enshrines her early days with Mapplethorpe this way: “We gathered our colored pencils and sheets of paper and drew like wild, feral children into the night, until, exhausted, we fell into bed.” They sound like Hansel and Gretel, living in a state of shared delight, blissfully unaware of what awaited on the path ahead.
506 2010-01-18 Justine Henin, for one, has floated upon the practice courts here after a nearly two-year retirement. The Australian Open is her second tournament since she announced her comeback in September. The Open has been an event of highs and lows for Henin. She was 21 when she beat her fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters here for the 2004 championship. In the 2006 final, she retired in the second set against Amélie Mauresmo because of stomach cramps. She withdrew from the 2007 Open when she was going through a divorce. The 2008 Open was her last Grand Slam event before she suddenly retired in May of that year as the world’s (weariest) top-ranked player.

Now, she is unseeded but rejuvenated and looking for her eighth Grand Slam title.

“I feel it’s my place to be here,” said Henin, 27, who opened her tournament against Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium on Monday afternoon. “It was great to be on the Rod Laver Arena again and to hit on this magical court, to see all these people again, people that I didn’t see for a long time.”

Clijsters, too, is renewing her acquaintance with the Australian Open. She took two years off to marry and have a baby, and then warmed the hearts of parents everywhere when she captured the United States Open last year in only her third tournament back.

“The two years I was away, a lot of things changed in my life and a lot of good things happened, and I wouldn’t change it for a thing,” said Clijsters, 26, who has reached at least the semifinals in five of her seven appearances here.

Henin reached the final of her first tournament back, losing to Clijsters last week in Brisbane. There is no possibility that Henin and Clijsters can turn back the clock and replay that 2004 match in this year’s finals. They are on track to meet in the quarterfinals. But Henin says she is not looking ahead that far.

“I think I am still here to build my confidence,” she said. “It will probably take a few tournaments to really be at my best. It doesn’t mean I can’t win matches.”

The odds on which players might capture the men’s and women’s draw are offered up daily. For the record, Federer is the 3-1 favorite on the men’s side over the defending champion, Rafael Nadal (5-1), who is drawing far less attention than the talented Scotsman Andy Murray (6-1), who is gathering smart and sentimental steam to capture his first Slam. On the women’s side, Serena Williams (3.75-1) is a slim favorite over Clijsters (4-1).

But as in years past, the Australian Open remains perhaps the most unpredictable of Grand Slams. Like a cricket test, winning seven five-set matches takes endurance, especially after a winter spent recovering from a grueling season. Like horse racing, long shots here do come in sometimes. Thomas Johansson, for example, was seeded 16th and had never advanced beyond the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event before capturing the 2002 men’s final.

Why can’t pluck and perhaps a bit of luck conjure a little stardust for the Australians? Lleyton Hewitt, 28, is playing his 14th Open. He is seeded 22nd and has made the final once, in 2005 when he lost to Marat Safin.

“I love walking down the corridors, walking onto center court,” Hewitt said. “I’ve played so many big matches, but not only in this particular tournament, in Davis Cups as well, Davis Cup final out there on center court. Yeah, I’ve got a lot of great memories from this place, playing at Melbourne Park. They all come back when you walk through the corridors out on center court,” he said, his voice trailing off.

How much would this tennis-mad nation love it if Hewitt made one more walk through the corridors to center court for the men’s final Jan. 31?

535 2010-01-19 After talking for years about the corrosive influence of money on New Jersey politics, Mr. Christie agreed to have his inaugural committee abide by the state’s recently enacted ban on so-called pay-to-play practices and restricted vendors who do business with the state from making contributions of more than $300 for the event.

And acknowledging the tough economic times that many state residents are enduring, Mr. Christie’s celebration at the Prudential Center in Newark will be pared down to look less like a black-tie gala than a street fair held indoors. Business attire will be encouraged rather than formalwear, and the festivities, which will have a “Taste of New Jersey” theme, will feature food stations from an assortment of caterers and restaurants from around the state. Most of the proceeds from the $500-a-ticket event will be donated to charities.

“When people are worrying about their jobs and their taxes, it just would have felt wrong to have people in tuxedos and gowns,” Todd J. Christie, the governor-elect’s brother and the chairman of his inaugural committee, said in an interview last month. “So this will be a way to celebrate some of the great things about New Jersey.”

Given Mr. Christie’s promise to “turn Trenton upside down” in his quest to close a budget gap of $8 billion, the celebration on Tuesday may seem like a momentary oasis of calm.

Much of the new governor’s day will be spent in Mr. Christie’s hometown of Newark, starting with an 8 a.m. Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart to be said by Archbishop John J. Myers. Mr. Christie, a Roman Catholic, will be accompanied by his wife, Mary Pat, and their four children.

The swearing-in ceremony, scheduled for 11:30 a.m. at the Trenton War Memorial, will be the only major event to be held in the state’s capital. It will be filled with faces familiar to Mr. Christie and his lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno. An a cappella rendition of the national anthem will be performed by Pat Guadagno and the Candle Brothers, a local group. Mr. Guadagno is Ms. Guadagno’s brother-in-law.

The oath of office will be administered by Stuart J. Rabner, the chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court, who once worked for Mr. Christie and alongside Ms. Guadagno when Mr. Christie was the United States attorney in Newark.

Mr. Christie has released few details of his inaugural address, which Ms. Comella said was being fine-tuned over the holiday weekend. But aides say that, befitting the occasion, it would include none of the stinging criticism that Mr. Christie has leveled at state officials in recent weeks. Mr. Christie, for example, lashed out at his predecessor when Mr. Corzine approved $120 million in aid to the state’s distressed cities. “Seriously, there’s eight days left,” Mr. Christie said. “Can he please keep his hand out of the cash register for the next eight days?”

Instead, Mr. Christie is expected to ask New Jersey residents to unite behind him by committing to community service and shared sacrifice.

After the swearing-in, Mr. Christie will travel to Newark, where he will stop by an early-evening pizza party for participants in the Newark youth hockey program before moving on to host his own celebration at the Prudential Center beginning at 6 p.m.

Mr. Christie’s brother, Todd, tried to lure Bruce Springsteen — New Jersey’s rock star laureate and the Republican governor-elect’s favorite musician — to perform by offering to make a donation to a charity of Mr. Springsteen’s choice. But Mr. Springsteen, who has performed at benefits for an assortment of Democrats in recent years, declined.

Instead, the inaugural lineup will include a set by the B Street Band, a Springsteen tribute group, and Michael Dutra, whose act is devoted to another New Jersey musical legend, Frank Sinatra.

Buddy Valastro, a cake maker at Carlo’s Bakery in Hoboken and a star of the reality program “Cake Boss” on TLC, has been hired to create a New Jersey-themed cake for the celebration to be unveiled at the inaugural party.

In an effort to reduce expenses and to donate as much to charity as possible, organizers made a bold move: asking guests to pay for their own drinks once the cocktail hour and its free alcohol ends.

“When people are paying $500 a ticket, they don’t want to hear that they’re going to be paying for drinks, too,” Todd Christie said. “But when you explain to them that it’s for these great causes, they get it. They don’t like it, but they get it.”
536 2010-01-19 The Wizards have distanced themselves from Arenas since the handgun incident, removing his likeness from the Verizon Center and issuing terse statements that could be a precursor to an attempt to void the deal.

“Gilbert Arenas has been a cornerstone of the Washington Wizards for six years,” the organization said after Arenas reached his plea deal last week. “We are deeply saddened and disappointed in his actions that have led to the events of this afternoon. Gilbert used extremely poor judgment and is ultimately responsible for his own actions.”

The morals clause stipulates that a team can void a contract if the player fails, refuses or neglects to “conform his personal conduct to standards of good citizenship, good moral character (defined here to mean not engaging in acts of moral turpitude, whether or not such acts would constitute a crime), and good sportsmanship.”

Such extreme action is rare. The language is purposely vague and subject to interpretation in order to cover a variety of circumstances. The clause has also never been successfully applied.

The Golden State Warriors most notably used it in an attempt to void the remaining three years and $23.7 million of Latrell Sprewell’s contract after Sprewell choked Coach P. J. Carlesimo in 1997. But the punishment was overturned by an arbitrator, who reinstated Sprewell’s contract and reduced his league suspension to 68 games from 82.

Teams have tried to void contracts, sometimes successfully, citing reasons other than moral turpitude.

The Boston Celtics cut Vin Baker and terminated his contract for violating terms of his alcohol-treatment program in 2004, although the sides eventually reached a financial settlement. And Roy Tarpley’s contract was voided because he violated the league’s antidrug policies.

“You can terminate a player’s contract for doing something far short of pleading guilty to a crime,” said Gabriel Feldman, the director of the sports law program at Tulane. “I don’t think the team will have much problem proving that Arenas met the burden of falling short of good conduct.”

The largest hurdle the Wizards could face, according to Feldman, is one created by N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern when he suspended Arenas indefinitely. The collective bargaining agreement forbids separate punishments from the league and a team for the same incident — the N.B.A.’s version of the legal system’s double jeopardy. Also, the N.B.A.’s penalty supersedes that of any the team imposes.

In reinstating Sprewell’s contract, the arbitrator in the case, John D. Feerick, took into account that Sprewell had already been handed a long suspension by the league.

“It prevents double punishment,” Feldman said. “Stern’s decision ended up being an impediment to the Wizards.”

The collective bargaining agreement does, in fact, include a provision that allows for a player to be punished twice for the same act if the “conduct is so lacking in justification as to warrant such double penalty.” But here, too, the language is ambiguous.

The wording is similar to many employment contracts around the country, said Geoffrey Rapp, a law professor at the University of Toledo.

“I’m not sure if it’s put in there because the employers expect to someday rely on it,” Rapp said, “or they are sending a message on how employees should act with the highest degree of integrity.”

In order to bypass the double-penalty clause, the Wizards could argue that Arenas is not being punished twice for the same action. They could claim that Stern suspended Arenas for his actions after the incident — joking about it on his Twitter page and pantomiming firing a gun at his teammates before a game — but not for the crime.

But the longer the indefinite suspension extends, Rapp said, the less likely an arbitrator will agree that Stern’s decision did not stem from the original incident.

Rapp also said that the best way for the Wizards to terminate Arenas’s contract could be to seek a declaratory release from an arbitrator, arguing that Arenas had breached its terms. Such a decision would protect the Wizards from litigation.

“That would be a safe approach, but it would cost them money,” Rapp said. “The problem is that it would take time to process, and I’m not sure if it’s time they are willing to wait.”

Any attempt to void Arenas’s contract would surely be resisted by the players union. Arenas and the union could argue that although he did commit a crime, his actions were not extreme enough to forfeit more than $80 million, and that it would be salary that he would be unlikely to recoup by signing with another team. In that case, in the absence of a declaratory release, Arenas could sue the Wizards.

Arenas is scheduled to be sentenced March 26 and could avoid prison time, an outcome that could work in his favor if the Wizards pursued removing him for breach of contract, Feldman said.

Because the relationship between Arenas and the Wizards is probably fractured beyond repair, the parties may ultimately be best served by brokering a settlement and divorcing.

“That may be the result you see — that the Wizards threaten termination and then they settle the case with a buyout instead of going through a lengthy legal procedure,” Feldman said.
537 2010-01-19 Apple Inc. is expected to hold an event on Jan. 27 to introduce its eagerly anticipated tablet computer. Apple sent invitations by e-mail message to reporters on Monday that said, “Come see our latest creation” at a theater in San Francisco.
538 2010-01-19 Mr. Elmer joins a group of whistle-blowers that includes Bradley Birkenfeld, the former UBS private banker who disclosed the bank’s secrets, pushing it toward a settlement with the United States government, and Heinrich Kieber, a former data clerk at the LGT Group, the Liechtenstein royal bank, who stole client data and funneled it to American and European authorities.

Mr. Elmer’s disclosures are attracting particular interest as the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department embark upon a strategy of “it takes a rogue to catch a thief” to encourage insiders who engaged in wrongdoing to reveal the secrets of their employers.

Lawyers and Congressional investigators who have begun to review Mr. Elmer’s claims say that his internal bank and client documents provide fresh ammunition for American authorities as they take their crackdown on offshore tax evasion beyond UBS to clients of other banks.

Mr. Elmer has given documents to the I.R.S., a Senate subcommittee investigating tax evasion and investigators for Robert M. Morgenthau, then the Manhattan district attorney, his lawyer Jack Blum said. They cover more than 100 trusts, dozens of companies and hedge funds and more than 1,300 individuals, from 1997 through 2002, Mr. Blum said.

Mr. Elmer contends that his documents detail the undisclosed role of American investment management companies in funneling American, European and South American clients who wished to avoid taxes to Julius Baer; the backdating of documents to establish trusts and foundations used to evade taxes; and the funneling of trades for hedge funds and private equity firms from high-tax jurisdictions through Baer entities in the Cayman Islands.

“What he has is the confirmation of something very important: that a number of other banks in the voluntary disclosure process are turning up,” Mr. Blum said, referring to 14,700 wealthy Americans, many of them UBS clients, who came forward to disclose their secret accounts last year. The I.R.S. declined to comment on Mr. Elmer’s case but said in a statement that it was “investigating other banks that have enabled Americans to evade taxes.”

Nothing indicates that Julius Baer, a 120-year-old private bank, is under I.R.S. investigation. The bank is known for intense privacy. Its board chairman, Raymond J. Baer, told shareholders last April that “the fiction of citizens being fully transparent must never become reality.”

Julius Baer, based in Zurich, had profits of more than $245 million in the first half of 2009 on more than $200 billion in client assets. In 2004, it sold its American wealth management business to UBS, whose offshore private banking operations for Americans came under federal scrutiny and led the bank to pay a $780 million fine in 2009 and admit to criminal wrongdoing. The acquired business was folded into a group led by Raoul Weil, the top UBS private banker who fled to Switzerland in 2009, after being indicted in the UBS case touched off by Mr. Birkenfeld.

Mr. Elmer worked for Julius Baer nearly two decades, the first 15 years in Switzerland and then as chief operating officer of Julius Baer Bank and Trust in Grand Cayman, beginning in 1994. As far as his own role in helping clients evade taxes, he said, “I didn’t realize what was going on.” Mr. Elmer said he discovered the tax evasion in 2002 and decided to expose Julius Baer’s operations.

Julius Baer denies that version of events. It contends that Mr. Elmer stole internal documents and client data around 2002, the year he was dismissed after raising concerns about the bank in the wake of being passed over for a promotion. He moved to Mauritius a year later.

“Shortly after leaving the employment of the Julius Baer Group in 2002, Cayman-based Elmer, clearly annoyed at having been dismissed and unable to secure a financial settlement to his satisfaction, engaged in a campaign to seek to discredit the Julius Baer group and certain of its clients,” the bank wrote by e-mail in December.

“This campaign has included threats against individuals and the use of documents inappropriately obtained and/or retained by Elmer following the termination of his employment, many of which were altered to create a distorted fact pattern or supplemented by forged documents, the creation of which Elmer has since admitted,” the bank wrote.

Swiss authorities, who briefly held Mr. Elmer in jail in 2005 on charges of breaching Swiss bank secrecy laws, are investigating whether he stole the documents.

In 2008, Mr. Elmer posted some of his documents on Wikileaks, a Web site that publishes whistle-blower information about government and corporate activity. In court papers the bank filed in February of that year, seeking unsuccessfully to prevent the disclosure of the records, the bank revealed the names of certain clients that Mr. Elmer had accused of tax evasion. They include Jonathan Lampitt, the president and chief executive of the Jupiter Investment Group, in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.; Winston B. Layne, a wealthy resident of New York; and Anna Kanellakis, an owner of a shipping company, Alpha Tankers and Freighters, based in Athens. A spokesman for Mr. Lampitt did not respond to requests for comment. Messages left at Mr. Layne’s Upper East Side home were not answered. A spokesman for Alpha Tankers said that it knew nothing about accounts at Julius Baer.

Elements of the dispute between Mr. Elmer and Julius Baer resemble a spy thriller. He said that Julius Baer had him followed by private investigators in Zurich and that superiors told him “it might be a good idea to go for a deep dive in the sea” — assertions that the bank denies.

The bank said it suspected Mr. Elmer of having mailed a suspicious white powder to its offices, which he denies. It also said that he forged a 2007 document on Julius Baer letterhead notifying Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany that the bank was closing her accounts because they “hid funds in offshore accounts.” Mr. Elmer says the letter, which he has posted on Wikileaks, is authentic.

His actions are “symptomatic of a generalized breakdown of bank secrecy,” said Christopher S. Rizek, a tax lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale in Washington who has represented scores of wealthy American clients of Swiss banks.
539 2010-01-19 Moving fast is crucial, Mr. Puig said. “We knew it would be a fairly easy deal to get my team into Santo Domingo,” he said. The hard part would be crossing into Haiti. “One of the team members knows the region very well. He knew that moving over by road would take forever and would be dangerous,” he added. The men chose to hire a helicopter and knew where to get one.

Both men (Mr. Puig said he could not give their names) have experience in the military special forces and “have operated in some of the worst places in the world,” he said. They carried satellite telephones and depended on already established contacts on the island to set up a base in Port-au-Prince for the medical specialists and others who arrived in the next day or two.

A key to effective response on the ground is establishing a network of local contacts in advance throughout the world, he said. Among relief workers in Haiti and the adjacent Dominican Republic, “there are a lot of people right now scrambling for a car, scrambling for guards, but those things become very scarce very quickly,” he said. In the Dominican Republic, “We put this guy we have on notice. He’s waiting for us. He’s got cars, he’s got guards with guns — all the things that you need to operate.”

By Monday, with teams now operating out of Port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo, International SOS said it had coordinated 52 evacuations from Haiti. Among the victims were corporate employees, humanitarian group workers and students. Clients needing help included 60 companies, 25 nonprofit organizations and universities, 10 government bodies and 10 private travelers from the United States and elsewhere.

“We have reached out to all of the clients” to establish priorities for getting people out of Haiti, Mr. Deroose said. Those who leave are being flown by helicopter or private plane to the Dominican Republic for medical treatment before being sent home.

Mr. Deroose, who was trained as a nurse, added: “The medical issues, in a catastrophe like this, are major trauma — broken legs, head injuries, punctured lungs. So speed of evacuation is critical.”

“But there is another category: the missing,” he said. “Some clients have told us, we have people here and we can’t get in contact with them.”

More than 7,000 companies around the world are clients of International SOS, which charges an annual membership fee and then bills for specific services, like emergency medical care and evacuations.

Meanwhile, despair is mounting among the millions in Haiti who do not qualify for rapid-response assistance under foreign corporate contracts. Already, angry denunciations are being heard from the island, among them charges that foreign citizens, especially Americans, are getting priority treatment while the poor, or the not-well-connected, languish in misery.

In response, Mr. Deroose says the company strives to leave behind “humanitarian support” after its corporate work is done. For example, he said, International SOS workers in Jakarta established a relief fund that still exists, after the earthquake and tsunami that struck Sumatra, Indonesia, in late 2004.

“We have an obligation to our clients, that’s our primary responsibility,” he said. “However, as a principle in the company culture, we never say no. We try to assist as much as possible.”
540 2010-01-19 My bus got stuck with the worst tour guide on the planet. She was knowledgeable, but as dull and dry as the economics teacher in the movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”

Nonetheless, I gave my assistant an envelope containing $100 in American currency and a thank-you note to give to our guide at the end of the trip. Each of the other tour guides received the same thing.

After the tour, I checked the group’s airline reservations for the next day’s flight to Cairo.

An agent handed me a handwritten manifest. Six people from my group weren’t on the list. That was a problem since everyone needed to be at an event that next evening, and this was the only flight going to Cairo that day.

I politely asked whether their names could be added, while simultaneously offering the attendant a “tip” of $60. The money was gratefully accepted, and I saw the person write the six names on the manifest.

When we got the airport the next morning, I went to check the list again.

Guess what? Those six people weren’t on this passenger manifest. But their luggage was being loaded onto the plane, along with all the other bags. In those days, we could keep track of all luggage by tagging it as one receipt at the hotel.

At a minimum, I had to retrieve the luggage of the six guests who wouldn’t be flying, since another flight to Cairo wouldn’t happen for a few days.

My assistant and I ran to the plane, but no one was around to help us.

We could see the luggage, so I figured why not just help ourselves. I hoisted my assistant into the plane belly to grab the six bags.

I thought we were home free until I felt something cold and pointy at the side of my neck. It was a bayonet. And it was being held by a very serious looking soldier-type person.

The next thing I knew I was escorted to his commander’s office. I thought I was being thrown into prison.

Instead, the lead officer shook my hand and asked if I was the person in charge of the group that went to the Valley of the Kings the day before.

He smiled and told me that his wife was my guide, and in her 20 years of leading tours she had never received a tip before, let alone such a generous one.

After I explained my dilemma, he told me not to worry. The six people whose names didn’t make the list would be allowed on the flight.

It was the smartest 100 bucks I ever forked over. I’m just glad I didn’t offer my guide some hot sauce. I think I’d probably still be in Egypt.
541 2010-01-19 The statistical association led to further investigation to determine for which protein the gene contained instructions. It did for one of the proteins called cadherins, which are found throughout the animal kingdom and are apparently involved in cell alignment, adhesion and signaling.

Cadherins have also been recently associated with autism spectrum disorder, which includes repetitive and compulsive behaviors, said Dr. Edward I. Ginns, senior author of the report in Molecular Psychiatry and director of the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

Dr. Dennis Murphy, a psychiatrist who was not associated with the study, said the results had the potential to advance understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dr. Murphy, also chief of the Laboratory of Clinical Science in the National Institutes of Mental Health’s Division of Intramural Research Program, is now working on finding and sequencing the CDH2 gene in humans to see whether it is linked to obsessive-compulsive behavior.

People with obsessive-compulsive disorder often engage in normal behavior that has become extreme, ritualized, repetitive and time-consuming, and suffer from anxiety and obsessive thinking.

Because the disorder involves obsessive thoughts and because of the difficulty of understanding animal cognition, the same kinds of behavior in animals has commonly been referred to simply as compulsive disorder.

As scientists learn more about the underlying molecular causes of this condition, they increasingly use “obsessive-compulsive disorder” to apply to animals and people.

Recent rough estimates by Dr. Karen L. Overall, a veterinarian specializing in animal behavior at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, suggest that up to 8 percent of dogs in America — five million to six million animals — exhibit compulsive behaviors, like fence-running, pacing, spinning, tail-chasing, snapping at imaginary flies, licking, chewing, barking and staring. Males with the problem outnumber females three to one in dogs, she found, whereas in cats the ratio is reversed.

Dr. Overall said dogs usually developed compulsive behavior between ages 1 and 4. Some of the Dobermans in Dr. Dodman’s group began earlier, with blanket sucking at around 5 months and flank sucking at 9 months.

Dogs can be treated, but if they are not, compulsive behavior is one of the main reasons that people give them up for adoption or euthanasia, according to veterinary behaviorists.

Dr. Overall said in an earlier paper that environmental causes might outweigh genetic factors in development of compulsive behaviors in some cases.

She said the practice of “hanging” a dog up by its choke collar, a form of discipline advocated by some trainers, produced compulsive behaviors. Dogs from puppy mills or shelters, rescue dogs and those that are confined and bored dogs or anxious also seem prone to compulsive behavior, she said.

Other domestic animals, notably cats and horses, as well as some of the animals at zoos, exhibit compulsive behaviors, including wool-sucking in Siamese cats, and locomotion disorders like stall walking and weaving in confined horses and pacing in captive polar bears, tigers and other carnivores used to ranging across large territories.

Although antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and behavior modification have proved effective at controlling compulsive behavior in dogs and people, they do not appear to correct underlying pathologies or causes, Dr. Ginns said. Those causes are likely to be as varied as the compulsive behaviors and as complex as the interplay of multiple genes and the environment.

“Stress and anxiety, as well as physical trauma and illness, can trigger repetitive behavior that then takes on a life of its own,” Dr. Ginns said.

But he believes that in many cases there is an underlying genetic predisposition that responds to environmental stimuli in such a way that once-normal behavior turns into something pathological. Those genetic dispositions may differ markedly between different behaviors.

Some geneticists say that because of their detailed pedigree and the similarity of their genes to those of humans, dogs make an ideal model for studying human behaviors and pathologies, especially those involving complex patterns of inheritance. Few humans keep detailed genealogies for themselves, but they are diligent in recording every detail in the ancestry of their purebred animals.

“Nick and I share an interest in pedigrees,” Dr. Ginns said in explaining how he and Dr. Dodman became collaborators with Kerstin Lindblad-Toh and her gene sequencers at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard, the same group that sequenced the dog genome now proving so valuable to both human and canine geneticists.
542 2010-01-19 Q. I sometimes get a gurgling stomach, loud enough for the person next to me to hear it. It happens with dairy or soda, or even without. What’s going on? Should I worry?

A. Most such noises reflect normal digestive processes and are not worrisome, especially if no other symptoms are present, said Dr. Jeffrey Milsom, director of the Center for Digestive Care at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.

The noises, frequently but not always after eating or drinking, occur when “air, or a mixture of air and fluids inside the channel of the intestines, rushes through the channel during the normal propulsion action,” Dr. Milsom said.

Gassy fluids like soda could lead to more noises right after swallowing, he said. Noise levels are affected by many other factors, including the person’s state of mind, with nervousness or tension possibly increasing the gurgling; the level of noise in the environment, with many people noticing the rumbling most in bed at night; and the types of food consumed, as well as how fast it is ingested.

Underlying diseases may lead to abnormal types of sounds, like high-pitched or rushing, continuous noises, Dr. Milsom said. These sounds, which may be related to a narrowing of the intestine, are usually accompanied by pain or other symptoms.

If the abdominal noises are persistent, get worse or are accompanied by pain, he said, then a medical opinion should be sought.
543 2010-01-19 MDC is spending an estimated $500,000 to start the index, which includes contributing four restricted shares of MDC stock to the fund for each Kirshenbaum Bond employee, for a total of 1,200 shares.

The index is a version of efforts by a growing number of agencies to put skin in the game by showing clients they are willing to be paid based on how their work performs in the marketplace. Other examples include agencies taking ownership stakes in client companies or sharing revenue from the sales of products they advertise.

“We’ve been hearing from a lot of clients that they want more accountability,” said Lori Senecal, who came to Kirshenbaum Bond in August as president and chief executive. “They need us to own their challenges.”

“The index is a tangible way to add that belief to our culture,” she added. The index is among steps Ms. Senecal is taking since she joined Kirshenbaum Bond from McCann Erickson Worldwide to, as she put it, “reinterpret its heritage in the service of the marketing needs of the future.” Translation: shake things up.

The agency, which gained a reputation in its early years for cheeky work like the “Wendy the Snapple lady” campaign for Snapple beverages, has been on a roller coaster more recently with gains of accounts like Vanguard offset by losses of clients like the Wendy’s fast-food chain.

“Agencies either go forward or backward; they don’t stay the same,” said Richard Kirshenbaum, who shares the title of co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond with Jon Bond. Although “we’re a very healthy and successful agency, and a very profitable one,” Mr. Kirshenbaum said, “it’s time to have renewed energy and spirit at a time when the landscape is changing” for the advertising business.

The index was the brainchild of two Kirshenbaum Bond employees: Aric Cheston, partner and creative director, and Matt Powell, chief technologist. They will each receive a cash bonus of $10,000 from MDC.

Starting an agency mutual fund was among 50 ideas presented by employees at a crowd-sourcing meeting in October that sought proposals to help revitalize Kirshenbaum Bond from everyone who works there.

Ms. Senecal is also adopting another idea from the meeting: The agency will devote the hours of 10 a.m. to noon each Friday to “hot housing,” as employees divide into groups and brainstorm new approaches for clients.“It’s motivating all levels of the organization from the bottom up,” said Miles S. Nadal, chairman and chief executive at MDC in Toronto. “If you want a behavior, you should create economic incentives to reward that behavior.”

MDC will look into “rolling this out on a broader basis,” Mr. Nadal said, by starting similar indexes and funds at its other agencies.

Among other moves by Ms. Senecal since she arrived at Kirshenbaum Bond were the hiring of Mick McCabe, a partner at Deutsch in New York, as the agency’s first chief strategy officer, and bringing in Marc Lucas, executive creative director at the New York office of Razorfish, as chief creative officer, assuming those duties from Mr. Kirshenbaum.

Kirshenbaum Bond has landed two major assignments under Ms. Senecal. One expanded the agency’s relationship with Capital One, which awarded Kirshenbaum Bond the task of creating ads in print, radio, digital and out-of-home media. The other assignment was to be agency of record in the United States for Vanguard.

Kirshenbaum Bond “understands our business metrics,” said Sean Hagerty, principal in retail marketing at Vanguard in Valley Forge, Pa., and knows how to “focus on how do we most efficiently and effectively talk to our audiences in a financially responsible manner.”

The agency’s first work for Vanguard is being developed, he added, and could begin appearing in March. (Vanguard’s shares are not in the portfolio because the company is privately held.)

As Kirshenbaum Bond employees watch the index, they may learn a lesson in the stock market: How the shares of a company fare does not always correspond to how the company is doing.

One way gyrations could be mitigated is that “the index is based on a number of clients in diversified industries,” Mr. Nadal of MDC said.

Besides, the index is intended to be “a long-term retention mechanism” for employees and “value is created over a longer period of time,” he added. “As Warren Buffett says, in the short term the stock market is a voting machine but in the long term it’s a weighting machine.”
544 2010-01-19 GENEVA (AP) — The Swiss Reinsurance Company said on Monday that it had transferred part of its American life insurance business to Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, for 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.27 billion) to free up capital and invest it more profitably.

The deal with Mr. Buffett, who already has a stake in Swiss Re, is effective retroactively to Oct. 1, 2009. It has freed up 300 million francs ($292 million) in capital, Swiss Re said.

The transaction, known as retrocession, means that Swiss Re has transferred the business to another reinsurer — Berkshire Hathaway. Reinsurance companies sell backup coverage to other insurers, spreading risk in the event of huge losses.

The life insurance business had failed to meet Swiss Re’s hurdle rate of 14 percent of returns, the company said.

“This is a significant step forward in Swiss Re’s strategy to increase capital efficiency,” said Christian Mumenthaler, who heads the company’s life and health department. ”The transaction puts us in an excellent position to redeploy the capital at more attractive returns.”
545 2010-01-19 The British candy maker Cadbury also remained in the spotlight amid speculation that its suitor Kraft Foods was preparing to sweeten its offer before a Tuesday deadline. Cadbury ended around 1.5 percent higher but investors remain skeptical that the current stand-off between the two companies can be ended.

“Some traders seem to feel that this has dragged on long enough, making any sort of deal unlikely,” said David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index.

Even though talks between International Power and Gaz de France failed to yield anything, analysts said there are expectations that the amount of mergers and acquisitions taking place will increase over the coming months as the global economy recovers from recession. One corollary of increased confidence is an increase in mergers and acquisitions.

When Wall Street returns on Tuesday, the focus will turn towards the next batch of fourth quarter corporate earnings — so far, earnings have been fairly mixed, with upside surprises from the likes of the chipmaker Intel offset by disappointments elsewhere, most notably the aluminum Alcoa Inc.

Banks will be in the spotlight especially after U.S. stocks fell 1 percent on Friday — the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst day of the year so far — as JP Morgan Chase & Company offered a cautious earnings guidance even though it reported a fairly strong set of results.

“We get Citigroup tomorrow which has less of the good bits of banking and more of the bad bits,” said Kit Juckes, chief economist at the ECU Group.

A meeting of the 16 finance ministers of the countries that use the euro in Brussels later will be closely monitored in the currency markets as the main topic of debate will be the shaky state of Greece’s public finances.

Concern about Greece’s debts has been one of the reasons why the euro has floundered over the last month or so from 16-month highs above $1.50. Earlier it hit a ten-day low of $1.4336 before recovering slightly to $1.4380.

Greece’s problems have fueled concerns that the country may eventually have to be bailed out by its partners in the eurozone. Some observers are even speculating about a possible Greek exit from the single currency zone.

“With rising concerns about the workability of the Greek government’s stability and growth plan, the firm rejection from within the eurozone of the idea of a bailout, the rapidly rising cost of default insurance on Greek sovereign debt and concerns over deficits elsewhere in the region, the problems for the single currency are mounting rapidly,” said Neil Mellor, a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.

570 2010-01-20 New York City school officials have agreed to assess the environmental risks posed by PCBs in school buildings and to come up with a plan for cleanups and for reducing potential exposure, federal officials said Tuesday.

Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency said that the city, under a binding accord, would conduct a pilot study to address potential violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act related to the presence of caulk containing PCBs above the allowable level of 50 parts per million.

They said the city had found unsafe concentrations of PCBs in testing during construction and renovation projects. They added that the city had estimated that hundreds of school buildings could have the same problem.

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are a class of highly toxic chemical compounds that were widely used in construction materials and electrical products in many buildings, including schools, from the 1950s until they were phased out in 1978, the E.P.A. said. They were commonly used around windows and door frames and in masonry building materials; with long-term exposure, they can cause cancer and affect the immune and reproductive systems when they are released from the caulk into the air or through direct contact, the agency said.

As part of the agreement between the E.P.A. and the city, officials with the School Construction Authority will test, assess and reduce exposure to PCBs in five schools. The pact is intended to lead to a citywide approach.

The five have yet to be chosen. Ross J. Holden, vice president and general counsel of the School Construction Authority, said one that was built between 1950 and 1977 would be selected in each of the five boroughs.
571 2010-01-20 JERUSALEM — Israel, which has catapulted in the past two decades from a minor state-dominated economy to a market-driven technology hothouse, is in the final stages of accession to the exclusive club of advanced countries, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But its secretive weapons trade, patent-bending drug industry and occupation of Arab lands are raising last-minute questions.

The secretary general of the O.E.C.D., Ángel Gurría, currently in Israel to discuss the issues with senior officials, said that he was confident they could be resolved and that Israel might miss the original target of May but would become a member this year.

But he acknowledged that Israel, unlike other small countries in the process of accession — Chile, Slovenia and Estonia — might face objections unrelated to the technical questions still to be answered.

“We have to keep the substantive issues on the straight and narrow,” Mr. Gurría, a former Mexican finance minister, said in an interview held after meetings at the Bank of Israel. “We should not allow technical issues to be used as masks for something that is in reality a political issue.”

That political issue is Israel’s declining international reputation because of its Gaza war a year ago and its continuing construction of Jewish housing in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Professional staff employees of the O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris, say all 30 member states must approve the accession of a country, and it remained unclear if any would object. But the three technical issues all still needed to be solved.
572 2010-01-20 Hendrik Speck, a professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Kaiserslautern, Germany, said competitors would probably follow Microsoft’s decision because consumers were increasingly concerned about online privacy amid widespread data theft and rising use of social networks.

“Google and other engines are starting to realize that consumers around the world are placing an increasing value on privacy and that can have business consequences,” Professor Speck said.

Europe is the world’s largest market for Internet searches, accounting for 32 percent of online queries, according to comScore, a market research company. The Asia-Pacific region had 31 percent of searches and North America 22 percent, according a comScore report in July. Google has a 67 percent share of the global search market, according to comScore, but a more than 80 percent share in Europe, where Microsoft has just 2 percent of the market.

In 2008, a panel of national privacy regulators from each European Union country asked Microsoft, Google and Yahoo to eliminate all online query data, like a computer’s unique identification number, location and the text typed into search fields, after six months.

The panel, known as the Article 29 Working Group, held a hearing with representatives of the search engine companies last February, and has given each until the end of January to respond.

Like other search engines, Bing had been keeping user data for more than 18 months. Last year, Microsoft said it would change its policy to make an individual’s Internet protocol, or I.P., address anonymous after six months if its major competitors did also.

In its announcement Tuesday, Microsoft said it would delete I.P. addresses after six months but would retain cookies and other session identifiers — software that recognizes a returning computer — for 18 months. Once it deletes an I.P. address, Microsoft said the link between data and a specific computer became effectively untraceable.

In a statement, Google gave no indication it would accept the European Union’s demands. The company’s global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, reaffirmed Google’s policy of making user data anonymous after nine months, saying it struck the proper balance between ensuring user privacy and refining the functioning of its leading search engine.

“Data from our search queries represents a crucial arm in our battle to protect the security of our services against hacks and fraud,” Mr. Fleischer said. “It also represents a critical element allowing us to help users by innovating and improving the quality of our searches.”

Yahoo, which had been deleting only a portion of individual I.P. addresses, said it would now delete the entire address after 90 days and make anonymous the log of a user’s activities. The policy would not apply to requests from law enforcement agencies that data be retained, said Amber Allman, a Yahoo spokeswoman.

Mr. Vassallo, the Microsoft executive, said his company’s decision to conform to European requests on data retention was meant to avert the possibility of new regulation.

“It is possible that the European Union will take a position to regulate this one way or the other,” Mr. Vassallo said. “That would need a high level of responsibility from industry.”
573 2010-01-20 What is more, there are indications that Google’s stand against Chinese censorship is already affecting some of the company’s business there. On Tuesday, Google said it would postpone the release in China of two mobile phones that are based on its Android operating system. The phones, made by Motorola and Samsung, and expected to run on China Unicom’s network, include many of Google’s mobile applications. Google asked its partners to postpone their release until the fate of its services in the country was settled.

Google made the announcement last week after it discovered that hacking attacks traced to mainland China had been directed at it and more than 30 other companies based in the United States. Motorola was one of the companies attacked, according to a person with knowledge of the attacks. Motorola declined to confirm an attack. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Erickson, said: “Motorola is committed to offering the most innovative mobile products and experiences in China, including Android-powered devices.”

No service is more threatened by Google’s vow to end its cooperation with Chinese censors than Google.cn. Chinese government officials have already appeared to foreclose the idea of an uncensored Internet search engine, saying simply that all Internet companies are welcome to operate in China as long as they follow the law.

But people with knowledge of Google’s strategy say that in talks to be held in the days and weeks ahead, company executives will make the case to the Chinese government that Google should be allowed to keep many of its other China operations intact. The business logic behind that drive is simple.

In most countries, Google draws the majority of its revenue from ads that appear on its search engine, but the No. 1 source of revenue in China comes from ads that Chinese companies place on Google’s sites in the United States. A person knowledgeable about Google’s business in China said ads that run on a network of Chinese Web sites are the company’s second-largest source of revenue in the country. Google can retain both of those if it is allowed to keep a sales force and advertising network there.

“Theoretically, they could keep a decent portion of the revenue,” said Brian Pitz, a UBS analyst.

Google will not disclose its revenue in China, but people with knowledge of the company’s finances said that quarterly sales were in the vicinity of $150 million, a small fraction of its nearly $6 billion global revenue in the most recent quarter.

The fate of Google’s research and development operations in China may be as important to the company as that revenue. Google is starved for engineering talent, and it has opened offices around the world in large part to tap local pools of skilled programmers. If forced to shut down entirely, Google may try to offer jobs in the United States to some of its Chinese engineers, but many more may lose their jobs, or worse for Google, end up working for rivals like Baidu, the leading Chinese search engine, or Microsoft.

Last week, David Drummond, Google’s chief legal counsel, indicated the company’s desire to keep its work force in China, noting that even before it introduced its local search engine in 2006, Google had a research and development operation there.

“We could revert back to when we had employees, but no site,” Mr. Drummond said.

Some experts warned Google not to expect much.

“It’s going to be a tricky minuet,” said Tom Doctoroff, chief executive for Greater China for JWT, the worldwide advertising agency. Mr. Doctoroff said Google’s decision to air its grievances in the open was “inelegant.”

“With any other company this would be the end,” he said. But because so much of China’s educated class values Google, the Chinese government may “be willing to find a face-saving solution,” he added.

575 2010-01-20 DAKAR, Senegal — Guinea’s military leaders appointed a veteran opposition figure as prime minister on Monday, a critical step in the transition to elections and civilian government later in the year, officials and news agencies reported.

The opposition figure, Jean-Marie Doré, was the choice of both a coalition of opponents of the military government, and the current military junta itself.

Mr. Doré, in his 70s and the leader of the opposition coalition, which is called the Forces Vives, is from the same ethnic group as the country’s military dictator, Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara. Soldiers from that group are thought to have played a leading role in the massacre, beatings and rapes of regime opponents in a stadium in the capital, Conakry, on Sept. 28. The ethnic group, from Guinea’s remote forest regions, is considered a particularly volatile element in the country’s armed forces, and Mr. Doré’s new role is considered a potentially peacemaking one.

“It was the Forces Vives that proposed Jean-Marie Doré. We are satisfied,” said Oury Bah, vice president of the political party Union of Democratic Forces in Guinea. Late last week Guinea’s military leaders and the coalition agreed to establish an interim government together, while Captain Camara, wounded in an assassination attempt early in December, announced that he would go into exile.

The deal caps a period of deep unrest in this West African country of 10 million people, a leading bauxite exporter whose people are among the world’s poorest. Captain Camara took over in a coup 13 months ago and ruled in an increasingly arbitrary way from his army-base headquarters. The September massacre, in which at least 156 people were killed by soldiers, resulted in intense pressure on the junta as both the United Nations and the International Criminal Court spoke of potential crimes against humanity.
576 2010-01-20 The shortlist for the Brit Awards, Britain’s equivalent of the Grammys, seems at least one name too short to many fans. Susan Boyle, above, who rocketed to fame last April after her appearance on “Britain’s Got Talent” and whose first record just finished a six-week run at the top of the Billboard album chart, selling more than three million copies, was nowhere to be seen among the nominees, who include Lady GaGa, Lily Allen, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen and the newcomer Pixie Lott. The winners will be announced on Feb. 16 at a ceremony in London.
577 2010-01-20 The Columbia decision “is the first thing that’s happened in New York that suggests the threat of a change in our eminent domain law,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a leading business group. “I think it’s frightening because there are few more important investments in our city’s future than that which Columbia is making.”

The clamor for reform is also being driven by a recent wave of sentiment against development in New York, as demonstrated last month when the City Council defied Mr. Bloomberg and rejected a plan by the Related Companies to convert the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping center. Emboldening critics is the sense that Mr. Bloomberg’s influence has waned since his narrow victory in last fall’s mayoral race.

“I think people are really getting a foul smell from what’s been going on,” said Michael Rikon, a lawyer who represents business owners in the Willets Point section of Queens, where the city intends to condemn property to make way for a large redevelopment project.

The appellate division ruling in the Columbia case seemed all the more stunning because in November, the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, had upheld the exercise of eminent domain for the Atlantic Yards development by Forest City Ratner in Brooklyn. (Forest City was The New York Times Company’s partner in the development of its headquarters building on land on Eighth Avenue that was acquired by the state through eminent domain.)

The Empire State Development Corporation, the state’s development arm, can force the sale of property either for a civic purpose or to eradicate blight. In its unusually vitriolic opinion, the court in the Columbia case said that as “a private elite institution” the university could not claim there was a civic purpose to its expansion.

That finding mystified supporters of the Columbia project. “Having great research universities is probably the single most important characteristic of a city that will succeed in the 21st-century world economy,” Ms. Wylde said. At the Harlem hearing, a Columbia executive vice president, Maxine Griffith, said the holdout properties were needed because the 16 new buildings would be connected underground. “If the basement can’t be connected, I don’t see how we can proceed,” she said.

The ruling also labeled the blight designation obtained by the state agency “mere sophistry” that was concocted years after Columbia developed its plans. The court chastised the state agency for commissioning its study of neighborhood conditions from the same consultant, Allee, King, Rosen & Fleming, known as AKRF, that Columbia had hired to help plan the project and prepare the environmental impact statement.

State Senator Bill Perkins, a Harlem Democrat whose district includes the neighborhood where Columbia is seeking to build its new campus, peppered Empire State officials at the hearing with questions about their reliance on AKRF, which has played a prominent role in most of the city’s major development projects. Accusing the consultants of having a “particular agenda in mind,” Mr. Perkins said that “it just doesn’t look good.”

Defending the agency’s choice, Anita Laremont, the development corporation’s general counsel, said: “Our judgment is that AKRF is the most qualified to do this work.” She said Empire State would appeal the court ruling but provided no details.

Lee Silberstein, a spokesman for AKRF, said in a statement: “For more than 25 years, AKRF has built its reputation through the objective gathering and analysis of data. Any suggestion that the firm — widely recognized as a trusted industry leader — would compromise the quality of its work is incorrect.”

Details about AKRF’s role in Columbia’s expansion plans became known because Mr. Siegel, the lawyer for the company fighting Columbia, used the state’s Freedom of Information Law to get 8,000 pages of documents. (The court said Empire State had “unconstitutionally” closed the record in the case before Mr. Siegel received all the documents he had asked for.) He also produced a 500-page report to show that the neighborhood was not blighted.

Mr. Siegel said New York was the only state that did not permit people resisting condemnation to be heard at the trial-court level, where there would be an opportunity for discovery and cross-examination of witnesses.

A provision to require trial-level review could be part of new legislation being drafted by Mr. Perkins, said Amy Lavine, a staff attorney with Albany Law School’s Government Law Center, who is advising the state senator. At the top of her list is substituting a specific definition of blight for the current standard of “substandard and insanitary.”

One model might be Pennsylvania’s law from 2006, which permits a blight finding only when a substantial number of properties meet certain conditions like being “unfit for public habitation” or having been tax delinquent for two years. “It’s about making sure there are objective standards relating to public health and safety,” Ms. Lavine said.

Ms. Lavine said she also supported lengthening the 30-day time limit for mounting a condemnation challenge.

Senator Perkins, who quoted the conservative columnist George Will with approval at the public hearing, said he expected to build a bipartisan coalition to improve the condemnation process. “Eminent domain is like a gun to people’s head,” he said.

Lisa Bova-Hiatt, a deputy chief at the New York City Law Department, said the city would argue in an amicus brief that Columbia’s new campus meets the definition of a civic purpose even though the university is private. But Ms. Bova-Hiatt said the city would not oppose “thoughtful change” in the eminent domain laws.

“What you don’t want to happen,” she said, “is for the hysteria of the moment to force ill-considered action.”
578 2010-01-20 Japanese officials scrambled Tuesday to contain the panic over JAL’s bankruptcy filing. Japanese diplomats have been mobilized to assure Tokyo’s business partners that JAL’s business will not be disrupted by a filing. Reservations and mileage points will be honored, the company said.

“Japan Airlines provides the foundation of our country’s future development,” the government said in a statement. “Until its restructuring is complete, the Japanese government stands ready to offer JAL the assistance necessary to maintain stable and reliable operations.”

A year ago, a bankruptcy filing would have been unthinkable for JAL, whose logo of a crane with wings outstretched came to symbolize Japan’s rise as a modern industrial power. Under the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party, JAL was propped up first as a state-owned airline and then, after privatization in 1987, with generous bailouts — even as it struggled to turn a profit.

But a new government in Tokyo has promised to break with the past. The Democratic Party, which swept to power in September, has criticized the previous government for pouring money into a carrier while allowing problems to fester: huge legacy costs, a bloated work force, mounting pension costs and an aging fleet.

Now, JAL and its investors are being forced to pay the price. The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, a state-backed turnaround body tasked by the court with the carrier’s restructuring, plans to push JAL to eliminate 15,700 jobs — a third of its work force — and slash pension benefits. The body will also eliminate a fifth of its international routes, as well as unprofitable domestic destinations.

Shareholders will be wiped out in a 100 percent capital reduction, which will go toward paying off the airline’s debt. The carrier’s main creditor banks will be forced to write off as much as 350 billion yen.

Taxpayers will also bear part of the burden: Under the turnaround plan, JAL will receive 300 billion yen in public money and further state-backed loans for another 300 billion yen.

Despite the fresh funds, rising fuel costs, intense price competition and hefty reorganization costs are expected to weigh on JAL’s bottom line. The carrier is headed for its fourth net loss in five years, and last week it drew on 145 billion yen in emergency assistance from a credit line supplied by a state-owned bank.

Meanwhile, the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation has asked the airline to hold off accepting investments from Delta or American, according to a person briefed on the matter. Delta has offered JAL $500 million in equity, as well as a substantial increase in passengers and revenue from its SkyTeam alliance, while American has offered $1.4 billion for JAL to stay within its Oneworld group. Delta and American both reaffirmed their investment offers on Tuesday.

The bidding war for JAL broke out in November, when Delta made a surprise offer to invest in JAL in hopes of luring the airline away from the Oneworld alliance, which includes American, to the SkyTeam Alliance, which does not have a Japanese partner. Delta, one of the two biggest carriers from the United States to Japan, along with United, offered to lend management expertise to help the airline reorganize, suggesting privately that the deal could be similar to Fiat’s management of Chrysler.

American, which has far fewer flights to Japan, quickly countered the Delta offer, offering its own help and stressing the benefits of staying in the Oneworld alliance. Both airlines have strenuously courted the Japanese carrier, with senior executives making a number of trips to Japan to meet with airline and government officials. The Open Skies treaty, reached in December, raised the stakes for JAL to choose sides.

However, any decision on an alliance will probably be put off, at least temporarily, while JAL sorts through the early complexities of its bankruptcy case.
579 2010-01-20 WASHINGTON  The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben S. Bernanke, asked federal auditors on Tuesday to review the central bank’s role in the much criticized rescue of the American International Group in 2008.

In a request apparently intended to calm the Fed’s critics, Mr. Bernanke said the Federal Reserve had already provided volumes of information on the bailout, including weekly updates, monthly reports to Congress and other documents.

The unusual action comes as the House prepares to hold a hearing on Jan. 27 about the bailout. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has been called to testify.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Treasury Department made about $182 billion available to A.I.G. from September 2008 to April 2009, fearful that if the insurer collapsed, it could bring down the financial system. The New York Fed has since taken steps to secure the money it is owed with the insurer’s assets.

The Fed’s handling of the A.I.G. rescue has come under withering scrutiny in recent months. In November, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program concluded that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which had provided $85 billion to avert the insurer’s bankruptcy, essentially failed to use its power during intense negotiations with A.I.G.’s trading partners.

The New York Fed  run at the time by Mr. Geithner  agreed to allow those counterparties, including Goldman Sachs and Société Générale, to be paid 100 cents on the dollar to terminate certain complex financial contracts with the insurance giant. The banks received tens of billions of dollars, far more than they would have gotten if A.I.G. had gone into bankruptcy.

This month, e-mail messages emerged showing that the New York Fed urged A.I.G. in November 2008 to limit some disclosure in its public filings about the payments. The messages were released by Darrell Issa, a California Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee who has been critical of the New York Fed’s actions.

Officials have said that there was nothing improper in the requests by the Fed to leave out what it considered irrelevant information and that Mr. Geithner was not involved at the time with the A.I.G. bailout.

While criticism from Congress has been generally directed at Mr. Geithner, the controversy has reverberated through the halls of the Federal Reserve in Washington. Mr. Bernanke awaits confirmation from the Senate to a second four-year term at the helm of the central bank.

Mr. Bernanke emphasized the need to clear the air in his letter on Tuesday, addressed to Gene L. Dodaro, the acting comptroller general, who oversees the Government Accountability Office. “To afford the public the most complete possible understanding of our decisions and actions in this matter, and to provide a comprehensive response to questions that have been raised by members of Congress, the Federal Reserve would welcome a full review by G.A.O. of all aspects of our involvement in the extension of credit to A.I.G.,” Mr. Bernanke wrote.

Edolphus Towns, the chairman of the House oversight committee, who called next week’s hearing, said on Tuesday afternoon: “I welcome Chairman Bernanke’s decision. Full transparency will help us better understand the government’s rescue of A.I.G.”
580 2010-01-20 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average ended at a 15-month high, climbing almost 1.1 percent, or 115.78 points, to 10,725.43. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.25 percent, or 14.20 points, to 1,150.23, and the Nasdaq was up 1.42 percent, or 32.41 points, to 2,320.40.

Amid Tuesday’s zeal, however, there were indications that financial firms faced high hurdles as they tried to escape the worst recession in decades. The banking giant Citigroup reported a loss for a second consecutive year, held back by losses on mortgages and credit cards.

Citigroup’s figures followed similarly cautious results from JPMorgan Chase last week. Taken together, the reports suggested Americans were still struggling to pay the bills amid high unemployment and depleted savings accounts.

“What’s going to be critical for banks is their ability to cut their loan losses — that’s going to be the principal source of earnings growth,” said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff. “Citigroup’s loss certainly raises a bit of a cautionary flag in terms of the entire financial sector.”

Still, investors said Citigroup’s results could have been much worse, and the $1.6 billion loss in 2009 was a stark improvement from the $27.7 billion deficit in 2008. Shares of Citigroup rose 3.51 percent and Bank of America climbed 0.37 percent. JPMorgan Chase, by contrast, fell 0.92 percent.

In other markets, the dollar gained and the euro fell on questions about the ability of several European nations, including Greece, to pay debt. As stocks gained, oil rose $1.02 to $79.04 a barrel after touching a three-week low during the day.

Investors were encouraged by heavy merger and acquisition activity, analysts said. Cadbury agreed to a takeover offer from Kraft on Tuesday, worth about $19 billion, that would create the world’s largest candy maker. Shares of Cadbury rose 6.15 percent.

In addition, Berkshire Hathaway said it would acquire part of the Swiss Reinsurance Company for nearly $1.3 billion, sending Berkshire shares up 2.59 percent.

Investors did not seem rattled by news that a barometer of confidence among home builders had fallen to its lowest level since June. Disappointing figures from the housing sector have become familiar headlines. Home prices continue to decline in some areas despite efforts by the government to revive sales through tax credits.

European markets closed higher. The FTSE 100 in London was up 0.34 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.8 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt climbed 0.98 percent. The Nikkei average in Tokyo declined 0.83 percent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 1.02 percent, and the Shanghai index was up 0.3 percent.

Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist for Key Private Bank, said investors were hopeful that a recovery was taking hold, especially in Asia, after China said it would tighten monetary policy.

Still, the recovery remains sluggish and uneven, he said.

“The markets are probably going to have a harder time beating expectations,” Mr. McCain said. “The hope is there is additional strength that may flow through from overseas that may help the U.S. economy get back on its feet.”

The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 4/32, to 97 12/32. The yield rose to 3.69 percent, from 3.67 percent late Friday.

Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
581 2010-01-20 There were no major upsets on a day the top half of the draw made its way through opening matches, though the crowd of 45,594 — a daytime record for the tournament — was enthralled by the possibility of one when Roger Federer had to overcome some uncharacteristic poor play before dispatching Russian Igor Andreev in four sets.

It was the first time in Federer’s past 25 opening-round Grand Slam matches that he had been taken past three sets. He looked merely mortal in dropping the first set to Andreev, whose girlfriend Maria Kirilenko bounced Maria Sharapova from the field on Monday in what remains the tournament’s biggest surprise.

Andreev lost his opportunity to shock the world, however, when he failed to put away five set points to go up 2-1 and back the tournament’s top-seed into an uncomfortable corner. Instead, Federer found his magic to win, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2), 6-0.

“Tough match,” a relieved Federer conceded. “He’s got incredible acceleration on his shots, obviously, especially his forehand. He’s very physical and intense, so I was happy with the start I got today. I was up a break and actually feeling well, and then there was a quick swing around and he was able to get the first set. That was tough, but I reacted, and I think I played a very good match from start to finish really. A few hiccups, but I think those are more due to his good play.”

Venus Williams, the No. 6 player in the world, needed just 72 minutes to dust No. 41 Lucie Safarova, 6-2, 6-2. It was her first match in three months, and Williams is trying to wipe out the memory of losing here last year in the second round to Carla Suarez Navarro.

This year it is Melanie Oudin who is going home early. The 18-year-old American who burst onto the scene with a run to the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open blew four match points to Alla Kudryavtseva to lose, 6-2, 5-7, 5-7.

“A match like this really hurts,” she said. “I can’t remember ever losing four match points.”

Nikolay Davydenko continued his dazzling play with a straight set pasting of Dieter Kindlmann. The 28-year-old Russian remains unbeaten in 2010, with victories over Federer and the world’s No. 2 Rafael Nadal in Doha.

“Now I feel like I can beat everyone,” he said. “Before, no. Mostly I was losing against these guys.”

Williams remains the player to beat on the women’s side, but her postmatch comments here Tuesday indicate the incident at the United States Open remains heavy on her mind.

“I think we still sort of, say, live in a man’s world,” she said, when asked directly if the she thought the punishment would have been milder if she were a man. “I’m the first to say that I like men to be strong, to be leaders. I think that’s absolutely important. But I just think at the same time some incidents can bring you back to life and back into reality.”

In her semi-final match against Kim Clijsters at the United States Open last year, she lost her temper while serving to stay in the match. Clijsters was ahead, 6-4, 6-5 and 30-15, when Williams was called for a foot fault after a second serve. That gave a point to Clijsters and brought up match point.

Williams was upset at the timing of the foot-fault call and turned toward the lineswoman and brandished her racket and, using profanity, threatened to stuff a tennis ball down her throat. After the lineswoman reported Williams’s comments to the chair umpire, Williams moved threateningly toward the lineswoman again.

Along with the fine, she was put on probation, meaning that she could be suspended from the United States Open if she has another “major offense” at any Grand Slam in the next two years. She says the probation will not temper her behavior.

“No, that hasn’t crossed my mind at all as if I yell too much, it would be a problem,” Williams said. “I feel like I can always be myself. You know, I just do the best that I can. I’ll say, ‘Come on.’ I’ll get frustrated. I’ll still be human. I’ll still make mistakes. I’ll still learn from them.”

585 2010-01-21 The documentary “Soundtrack for a Revolution” is essentially a condensed, lightly airbrushed, skillfully assembled history of the civil rights movement, with musical interludes. It’s civil rights’ greatest hits: Montgomery, Selma, Birmingham; “Eyes on the Prize,” “We Shall Not be Moved,” “We Shall Overcome.” It’s the kind of film that will have audiences clapping and singing along. And why not? The images and stories may be familiar, but it’s history worth retelling.

In their previous film, “Nanking,” the directors Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman had actors, in costume and makeup, “play” historical figures by reading from their letters and diaries. In “Soundtrack” they tweak the traditional archives-and-talking-heads format by pausing for music-video-style performances of spirituals and protest songs by contemporary artists including Joss Stone, Wyclef Jean and the Roots.

The premise is that the role of music in the movement will be illuminated. That doesn’t happen in any significant way, but no matter; you wouldn’t want more time taken away from the vivid testimony of activists like the Rev. Samuel Billy Kyles, the freedom rider Hank Thomas and the Selma marcher Lynda Lowery. The directors have said that by using current recording artists they hope to reach a school- and college-age audience whose knowledge of the movement is limited to “I have a dream.”

The Roots and John Legend may not skew that young, and in any case the best musical moments belong to the oldest performers: the Blind Boys of Alabama, backing Anthony Hamilton on “This May Be the Last Time,” and the folk lion Richie Havens (who turned 69 on Thursday) singing “Will the Circle be Unbroken.”

Written and directed by Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman; directors of photography, Buddy Squires, Jon Else and Stephen Kazmierski; edited by Jeffrey Doe; music by Philip Marshall; produced by Joslyn Barnes, Jim Czarnecki, Mr. Guttentag, Dylan Nelson and Mr. Sturman. At the BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Running time: 1 hour 22 minutes. This film is not rated.

606 2010-01-21 The recession hit this year’s college freshmen hard, affecting how they chose a school as well as their ability to pay for it, according to an annual nationwide survey released Thursday.

Over all, students were more likely than previous freshmen to have a parent who was unemployed and less likely to have found a job that might help pay for college.

About two-thirds of incoming students said they had “some” or “major” concern about their ability to pay for their education. The percentage of those with “some” concern — 55.4 — was at its highest level since 1971.

The number of students taking out loans was at its highest in nine years, at 53.3 percent.

“We expected that, given what we were seeing last year in the economy, we would see some significant changes in how finances were impacting people’s ability to pay,” said John H. Pryor, director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the University of California, Los Angeles, which conducts the survey.

“What was more surprising,” he said, “was that it goes beyond just that into other areas. Everywhere we turned, whether it was how you chose your college or what do you think you are going to do in college, everywhere the finances piece popped out.”

609 2010-01-21 SAN FRANCISCO  It’s a formidable high-tech face-off: Amazon.com versus Apple for the hearts and minds of book publishers, authors and readers.

Amazon’s Kindle devices and electronic bookstore now dominate a nascent but booming market, accounting for more than 70 percent of electronic reader sales and 80 percent of e-book purchases, according to some analysts. And on Thursday it will take a page from Apple and announce that it is opening up the Kindle to outside software developers.

Apple’s much-anticipated tablet computer, which is widely expected to be announced next Wednesday and go on sale this spring, will be a far more versatile (and expensive) device that will offer access to books, newspapers and other reading material through Apple’s popular App Store on iTunes.

Book publishers, who rail against the dominance of Amazon and its insistence on discounting new releases to $9.99, are now playing the tech titans against each other.

In the process, they may be rushing from the clutches of one tenacious chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, into the arms of another, Steven P. Jobs, whose obstinacy over pricing has given the music industry similar paroxysms of anxiety.

“Will Kindle pricing trump Apple sex appeal? Isn’t that the question, really?” said Richard Charkin, executive director of Bloomsbury Publishing in London, who has been watching developments in e-book sales with keen interest. “I haven’t the faintest idea. All I would say is, great. The more people that are out there marketing books in digital or any other format, the better.”

There are now almost daily tactical moves by various parties in the business, with no end in sight.

In its announcement Thursday, Amazon will say that it is letting programmers create what it calls active content  similar to applications  for the Kindle and keep 70 percent of the revenue from each sale after paying for wireless delivery costs.

Amazon will release a set of programming guidelines that other companies  including publishers of books and periodicals  can use to create and sell applications for the Kindle.

Until Amazon introduces more advanced models of the Kindle, developers will be limited by its slow-to-refresh black-and-white screen.

Ian Freed, vice president for the Kindle at Amazon, said he expected developers would devise a wide range of programs, including utilities like calculators, stock tickers and casual video games. He also predicts publishers will begin selling a new breed of e-books, like searchable travel books and restaurant guides that can be tailored to the Kindle owner’s location; textbooks with interactive quizzes; and novels that combine text and audio.

“We knew from the earliest days of the Kindle that invention was not all going to take place within the walls of Amazon,” Mr. Freed said. “We wanted to open this up to a wide range of creative people, from developers to publishers to authors, to build whatever they like.”

The move may also represent a shift in Amazon’s relationship with newspapers and magazines that make digital editions for the Kindle. Many executives at those organizations have expressed dissatisfaction with their 30 percent cut of subscription fees on the Kindle and lack of a direct relationship with those subscribers.

With a Kindle app store, those media companies will be able to sell more profitable Kindle applications, and present news that is updated throughout the day.

Amazon may be rushing to change the rules of its Kindle platform with an eye toward the fanfare that will no doubt greet Apple’s long-awaited tablet. The devices, to be sure, are fundamentally different: Amazon has positioned the Kindle as the ultimate reading device, easy on the eyes and slow to deplete its battery. Analysts say that to buyers of an Apple tablet, playing video or video games may be more important than reading.

But for book publishers, Apple’s introduction provides a potentially golden opportunity: the chance to counter Amazon’s control over the e-book market and regain some leverage over sensitive matters like pricing.

Apple representatives have been in New York this week talking to the largest trade publishers, according to industry executives. They said Apple had proposed an arrangement under which publishers would get to set the price of their books, with Apple taking a 30 percent commission and the publishers keeping the rest. Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment on what he called “rumors and speculation.”

Depending on whether Apple sets an upper limit on pricing, its model could be much more appealing to publishers, who resent how Amazon has aggressively discounted their books. Typically, Amazon charges $9.99 for new releases and best sellers, a price that other e-book vendors, including Sony and Barnes & Noble, have effectively been forced to follow.
610 2010-01-21 WASHINGTON  President Obama on Thursday will publicly propose giving bank regulators the power to limit the size of the nation’s largest banks and the scope of their risk-taking activities, an administration official said late Wednesday.

The president, for the first time, will throw his weight behind an approach long championed by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and an adviser to the Obama administration. The proposal will put limits on bank size and prohibit commercial banks from trading for their own accounts  known as proprietary trading.

The White House intends to work closely with the House and Senate to include these proposals in whatever bill dealing with financial regulation finally emerges from Congress.

Mr. Volcker flew to Washington for the announcement on Thursday. His chief goal has been to prohibit proprietary trading of financial securities, including mortgage-backed securities, by commercial banks using deposits in their commercial banking sectors. Big losses in the trading of those securities precipitated the credit crisis in 2008 and the federal bailout.

The president will speak at an appearance on Thursday at the White House with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, an administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. It will come after a meeting with Mr. Volcker.

A similar discussion is percolating in Europe, led by Mervyn King, head of the Bank of England.

The president’s announcement comes as his popularity in public opinion polls is falling because of stubborn unemployment and the stagnant economy, and just days after he suffered a stinging loss when the Republicans won the Senate seat from Massachusetts.

It will be the third time in just a week that he has waded into the battle heating up in Congress over tightening regulation of financial institutions to avoid the sort of abuses that contributed to the near collapse on Wall Street. Last week he proposed a new tax on some 50 of the largest banks to raise enough money to recover the losses from the financial bailout, which ultimately could cost up to $117 billion, the Treasury estimates.

And this week, he served notice to senior lawmakers that he wants an independent agency to protect consumers as part of any financial overhaul legislation.

Only a handful of large banks would be the targets of the proposal, among them Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street trading house, became a commercial bank during this latest crisis, and it would presumably have to give up that status.

“The heart of my argument,” Mr. Volcker said, “is who we are going to save and who we are not going to save. And I don’t want to save what is not at the heart of commercial banking.”

Mr. Volcker has been trying for weeks to drum up support  on Wall Street and in Washington  for restrictions similar to those passed in the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933. That law separated commercial banking and investment banking, so that the investment arm could no longer use a depositor’s money to purchase stocks, sometimes drawing money from a savings account, for example, without the depositor’s knowledge.

The 1929 stock market crash and subsequent Depression made a shambles of that practice. But Glass-Steagall was watered down over the years and revoked in 1999.

Now the concern is a new type of activity in which financial giants like Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase engage. They now operate on two fronts. On the one hand, they are commercial banks, taking deposits, making standard loans and managing the nation’s payment system. On the other hand, they trade securities for their own accounts, a hugely profitable endeavor. This proprietary trading, mainly in risky mortgage-backed securities, precipitated the credit crisis in 2008 and the federal bailout.

Mr. Volcker, chairman of the president’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, a panel of outside advisers set up at the start of the Obama administration, has gradually lined up big-name support for restrictions on such trading.

But the Obama administration until now focused on regulating the activities of the existing financial institutions, not breaking them up or limiting their activities. Under the new approach, commercial banks would no longer be allowed to engage in proprietary trading, using customers’ deposits and borrowed money to carry out these trades.

“Major institutions with a deposit facility should not be allowed to invest in subprime obligations under any conditions,” said Henry Kaufman, an economist and money manager, and one of a dozen prominent Wall Street figures who have told Mr. Volcker that they support his proposal, in principle if not in detail.

Others include William H. Donaldson, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Roger C. Altman, chairman of Evercore and a Treasury official in the Clinton administration, and John S. Reed, a former chairman of Citigroup.

“When I was running Citi,” Mr. Reed said of his tenure in the 1980s and 1990s, “we simply did not trade for our own account.”
611 2010-01-21 Federal authorities are scrutinizing certain financial derivatives that may enable Wall Street banks to avoid collecting billions of dollars in withholding taxes on stock dividends.

The instruments, known as equity swaps, mimic ordinary shares and give investors like hedge funds the benefits of stock ownership, including payments similar to dividends, without actually owning the shares. Big banks also benefit from the swaps because, under federal tax rules, the banks may avoid paying a 30 percent tax that is normally levied on stock trades.

The Internal Revenue Service is examining whether banks are using the swaps to mask who really owns the shares underlying the instruments, thereby avoiding collecting dividend withholding taxes.

In effect, the I.R.S. suspects that the banks are disguising who owns the stock in order to help their offshore hedge fund clients avoid the withholding tax — a tax the banks are supposed to collect.

Mark H. Leeds, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said on Wednesday that the scrutiny indicated the I.R.S. increasingly viewed equity swaps as “evidence of tax avoidance.”
612 2010-01-21 Agents in riot gear from Immigration and Customs Enforcement tried to break up a hunger strike by detainees at the Varick Federal Detention Center in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, three detainees at the center said Wednesday in telephone interviews.

Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, denied that there was “a sustained hunger strike” at Varick, but said immigration agents entered and searched a jail dormitory when detainees complaining about conditions refused to leave it.

A Jamaican detainee in one dorm said “all hell broke loose” after about 100 inmates refused to go to the mess hall on Tuesday morning and gave guards a flier declaring they were on a hunger strike to protest detention policies and practices.

The detainee, who asked that his name not be published for fear of retaliation, said a SWAT team used pepper spray and “beat up” some detainees, took many to segregation cells as punishment and transferred about 17 to immigration jails in other states. The 20 detainees remaining in his dorm were threatened with similar treatment if they continued the hunger strike, he said.

But Mr. Chandler, in a written statement, said, “No pepper spray was used at any time during this search, and any allegations of threat or intimidation are simply untrue.”
613 2010-01-21 VMG Global, a sports nutrition company in California, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to selling products under the guise of dietary supplements that had been illegally spiked with steroids, according to court documents.

The Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over dietary supplements, defined as products that can offer general health benefits but cannot claim to treat specific diseases or symptoms. Products marketed as dietary supplements that are found to contain undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients like steroids are considered to be illegal, misbranded drugs.

Last year, the F.D.A. warned consumers not to buy products marketed as body-building supplements because of concerns that some items might contain undeclared steroids, which can cause serious long-term health problems like acute liver injury, the agency said.

From 2005 through the middle of 2009, according to the documents, VMG Global, which also does business as American Cellular Labs, knowingly deceived consumers and the government by marketing two illegal drug products that each contained a synthetic anabolic steroid under the guise of dietary supplements.

During this time period, the illegal products, called Tren Xtreme and Mass Xtreme, generated revenue of about $5.6 million, the documents said. Mass Xtreme, for example, contained Madol, a designer steroid first identified six years ago during the investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, the documents said.
614 2010-01-21 After days of back and forth, a government commission issued what it called a final list of 511 names on Monday of people who were disqualified from taking part in the election on the grounds of promoting the Baath Party. Still, four more names were added Tuesday, including Dhafer al-Ani, a Sunni lawmaker, and Abdul-Kader al-Obeidi, the defense minister, officials said. Those candidates have three days to appeal, and officials predict that they will have a final list of candidates by month’s end.

Many Iraqi politicians expect the process to go forward, whatever their objections, but diplomats are pushing to resolve the dispute. They fear an election lacking credibility would deprive any government of legitimacy, a reasonable worry given the degree to which many Sunnis already view Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s government as beholden to Iran.

Iraqi officials say Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in conversations with Iraqi leaders, suggested postponing the question of disqualifications until after the election. Electoral officials worry that is impractical. The body disqualifying the candidates, the Accountability and Justice Commission, has also offered to let some barred candidates sign a declaration denouncing the Baath Party as a step toward being allowed to take part.

“A humiliation,” responded Shaker Kattab, a spokesman for Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi. “This is what Saddam used to do.”

Like so much in Iraq these days, the issue goes back to the earliest days of the American occupation, when L. Paul Bremer, the administrator of Iraq, outlawed the party in May 2003 and in November that year started a commission to oversee what was known as de-Baathification, barring all but the party’s junior members from public life.

In Arabic, the word for it, ijtithath, was far stronger, meaning to uproot or tear out.

The Accountability and Justice Commission, while on shaky legal grounds, has served as its successor, though it remains no less contentious. The man in charge of the disqualifications, Ali Faisal al-Lami, is a close aide to Ahmed Chalabi, once a confidant of the Bush administration in the preparations for the war. Mr. Lami has close ties to Iran and was suspected in the murderous activities of Shiite militants — charges that he denies.

Confusing matters, he, like Mr. Chalabi, is a candidate, vetting other candidates.

Mr. Lami dismissed the notion that the process he oversaw was in any way politicized. He maintained that the commission faithfully carried out Iraq’s de-Baathification laws, eliminating candidates who were on the commission’s databases of former members of the party, or Iraq’s security forces. If the disqualifications resulted in feelings of disenfranchisement, he said, it was the fault of the law, not his commission’s work. But critics view the charges of promoting the party as merely a tool to eliminate secular opponents of Iraq’s Shiite religious parties who stood to fare well in the March 7 vote. Many say the breadth of the disqualifications has underlined how far Iraq remains from resolving the question of precisely what national reconciliation means.

Mr. Hashemi called the ban “dangerous.” “Those barred candidates,” he said after meeting the British ambassador, “had become partners in the political process and accepted its terms and standards.”

Perception has long guided events here, often shaped by sectarian and ethnic identities and the narratives that construct them. For many Shiites and Kurds, Baathist remains a chauvinistic term that connotes the genocidal campaign against Kurds at the end of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and the mass graves filled after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.

While opinions vary widely, the party still enjoys support in Sunni regions, some of it expressed in affection for Mr. Hussein himself. In Anbar Province, he is often idealized as a nationalist figure who stood against Iran and savagely repressed religious parties. Even opponents of Mr. Hussein see the term Baathist as coded language.

“We need a definition for the word,” said Mr. Mashhadani, the spokesman for Mr. Sammarai. “Who’s a Baathist? What is a Baathist?”

Sometimes the issue incites more fervor among exiled politicians than it does in the streets, where the compromises of living under dictatorship were often better understood.

“Everyone was a Baathist under Saddam, three-quarters of the country,” said Hussein Abbas, a storekeeper in the Shiite neighborhood of Greihat. “If he was a Baathist and didn’t do anything, it’s not up to us to repress him. We can’t forbid him from living.”

Iraq’s Constitution clearly bans the party. The law that formed the commission also stipulates which members of the Baath Party should be banned. Falah Shanshal, who leads the parliamentary committee that oversees the commission’s work, said Tuesday that the disqualified candidates included party members, fighters in a Hussein-era militia, intelligence operatives, senior military officers and individuals promoting the party.

“We are building a state of law and institutions,” he said in an interview, echoing other Shiite leaders, who are nearly unanimous on the bans. “We can’t allow the Baath Party back into political life. The law prohibits it and we are here to implement it.”

But even in the law, much remains undecided. Critics ask what constitutes promotion of the party. And how do figures like Mr. Obeidi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni lawmaker who left the party in 1977 and took part in drafting Iraq’s Constitution, qualify. Adding to the lack of transparency is that evidence, so far, has remained secret. And occasionally, officials say, names have been added and dropped in seemingly arbitrary ways.

“They are targeting us because they fear our popularity,” said Mr. Ani, one of the barred lawmakers.
615 2010-01-21 The most direct official statement came on Tuesday, when Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news conference that Google was not exempt from Chinese law, implying that the company would have to continue self-censoring its Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, if it wanted to keep doing business in China.

“Foreign enterprises in China need to adhere to China’s laws and regulations, respect the interests of the general public and cultural traditions, and shoulder corresponding responsibilities,” Mr. Ma said.

Some Chinese say the government is unlikely to escalate the dispute with Google unless the United States does. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is to deliver a speech in Washington on Internet freedom on Thursday that will be closely watched in China. Some Chinese experts say the tone of her comments could propel the Google dispute in a more ideological direction, spurring incendiary speech on one side about the quashing of media freedoms and on the other about Western neo-imperialism.

“If it were a simple matter of Google and China, obviously Google wouldn’t be conferring with the U.S. State Department,” said an editor for a Communist Party newspaper. “So the Chinese government is still waiting for Hillary to speak and for Google to make its final decision and so forth.”

The conflict exploded last week when executives at Google said it and more than 30 other American companies had come under sophisticated attacks from hackers. Those attacks were traced to mainland China, executives said. Google had also been monitoring a separate series of attacks against the Gmail accounts of dozens of human rights advocates doing work on China.

In response, Google said it would negotiate with the Chinese government to put an end to an unwelcome requirement that it self-censor Google.cn. Google is prepared to shut down Google.cn, but reportedly wants to keep much of its local business and engineering operations.

Two Western officials in Beijing said there was no unity yet among Chinese officials on how to handle the matter. That indecision is fueled by the fact that Google has yet to change its operations — it still self-censors searches on Google.cn — or enter into serious discussions with Chinese officials.

Some Chinese officials seem to be aware that pushing back against Google too hard and too fast — like blocking Google.com or cutting off Gmail — could raise the ire of ordinary Chinese, especially liberals here who already bristle at censorship.

“The government was taken off guard and is still nervous,” said a well-connected Chinese media investor, “because all the international media are standing with Google, and even in China a lot of media people feel what they are doing is right.” But all officials can do, he said, “is try to make the problem pass as quietly as possible.”

The investor said other big Internet companies with foreign investment had tried to approach the State Council Information Office, the lead government agency in charge of executing China’s media and Internet policies, to discuss the Google matter and its larger implications. But they were rebuffed, he said.

One liberal Chinese blogger said he got a call last Sunday from a low-level Chinese official who had been ordered by senior officials to collect suggestions on how to treat the matter. “It proves they’re still collecting advice because this is a confusing thing,” the blogger said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing his relationship with the official.

Patriotic Chinese writers and newspapers have called for China to stand up to Google, but the only real official editorial was a mild one on Monday in China Daily, an official English-language newspaper. Titled “A Matter of Business,” it emphasized the government line that the dispute was all about commerce.

“Whatever the real cause for Google’s possible move, this case is purely business in nature and it should have nothing to do with political ideology,” it said. “If this Internet giant has political values, it should never have been involved in such a business.”

Part of the government’s strategy to deflect Google’s accusations appears to be to present cyberattacks as common and the Chinese government as a victim, just like Google. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that in the week ending Jan. 10, 178 government Web sites were maliciously attacked, a fourfold increase from the previous week. The ministry described the state of Internet security that week as “generally poor,” according to Beijing News, a daily newspaper.

One Internet security analyst said China’s approach might work to its advantage. “Let Google do the escalating,” he said, “and put the blame on Google.”

Dan Brody, a former executive at Google China, said that if Google refused to continue self-censorship, “it’s going to be up to the Chinese government to decide, ‘Are you going to block Google.cn and receive the international opprobrium?’ And the Chinese government doesn’t have a track record of bending to the will of international public opinion.”
616 2010-01-21 After a month during which many participants expressed disappointment at the outcome and ascribed blame to various actors, Mr. de Boer described the next several weeks as a “cooling-off period that gives countries useful time to work with each other.”

Next week, for example, the major developing countries that helped fashion the agreement — China, India, Brazil and South Africa — will meet in New Delhi to review the Copenhagen agreement and plan for the next phase of talks. None of them have yet inscribed their plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the Copenhagen document, Mr. de Boer said. Without a commitment to such plans, a major accomplishment at Copenhagen — pledges by large polluters in the developing world to cut emissions — will have been thwarted.

Mr. de Boer said several officials from those countries had told him that they negotiated the accord with the understanding that it would be formally adopted by all the nations at the conference. But in a raucous conclusion to the meeting in the early hours of Dec. 19, the conference agreed only to “take note” of the accord, not to endorse it. And five nations dissented even from that.

Mr. de Boer said he expected a number of countries to miss the Jan. 31 deadline, and he would not predict that they would ultimately submit their plans.

“Whether those countries do in fact decide to associate with it remains to be seen,” he said.

Connie Hedegaard, the former Danish environment minister who is soon to become the European Union’s commissioner for climate action, said it was critical for the United States and the large emerging economies to formally inscribe their pollution-reduction targets in the accord.

“I think much will depend on how countries treat that deadline,” she said. “If only Europe and Japan come up with plans, then you have a very different situation than if the U.S. and major emerging economies all step up.”

Todd Stern, the chief American climate negotiator, said the United States fully intended to enshrine in the accord its declared target of a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2020. He, too, said it was “incredibly important” for all the other major emitters to submit their public pledges for inclusion.

But he also said that success of the accord hinged on the creation of a rigorous and enforceable system of monitoring and verifying emissions-reduction programs. The accord calls for such a system, but does not provide details.

The nations of the world, Mr. de Boer said, are counting on President Obama to follow through on the emissions-reduction pledge he made at Copenhagen, despite Congress’s reluctance to pass an ambitious climate bill. “Any self-respecting person,” he said, “would well like to deliver on what we promise.”
617 2010-01-21 Technocel, an electronic accessories company, introduced what it calls the Ear Vibe, “the first stereo headset that vibrates to the beat of your music” at the Consumer Electronics Show. The $30 earbud-style headphones begin to move a bit when they encounter low-frequency notes. It’s kind of a makeshift bass enhancement.

Perhaps it’s somewhat coincidental that at the same trade show, Sennheiser, which makes audio accessories, displayed a new line of headphones that it had developed with Adidas. One of its selling points, Sennheiser says, is that the products “are insensitive to vibration.” Go figure.

For a more upscale version, serious listeners might consider Sony’s latest effort in noise-canceling technology: the Sony MDR-NC300D Digital Noise Canceling Earbuds, priced at a budget-canceling $300.

The tweak with Sony’s headphones is artificial intelligence, which automatically selects the optimal noise cancellation mode based on the outside environment, like a plane, a train or an office. The headphones, which will run for about 20 hours on an AA battery, come with a variety of fittings to accommodate up to seven different sizes of ears. They will be available in February.

618 2010-01-21 Bobby Bognar seems willing to eat almost anything. But about once an episode on his new show, “Food Tech,” he encounters something even he is compelled to spit out.

In the opening installment, Thursday night on History, it’s a pickle that is only partway through the debrining-and-flavor-enhancing process. In Episode 2 it’s a crunchy sediment that is a byproduct of the creation of soy sauce.

Whatever the proper etiquette is for quietly removing something unpleasant from your mouth, Mr. Bognar doesn’t follow it; he just spews the stuff out. It’s kind of endearing, in a gag-inducing way.

“Endearing” is what might set this late-to-the-dance show apart from the numerous other television offerings about food and where it comes from. Mr. Bognar, whose credentials seem to be that he has worked in a broad range of food-industry jobs and is in a Los Angeles rock band, is nothing if not genial.

Unfortunately that also gives the program, which each week examines the cornerstones of cherished American fast food and the ingredients that go into them, a superficial feel. The opening episode, “Cheeseburger & Fries,” doesn’t spend a lot of time on the meat portion of that meal, which we know from investigative journalism is often produced by a process that is questionable on several fronts.

But no television show is going to give a full picture of where our food comes from because no food producer is going to allow the uglier side of the process to be filmed. The operations Mr. Bognar visits all look as pristine as a hospital surgical ward.

That allows him to let his natural enthusiasm for all things edible to take over, and it makes for a nicely watchable if nontaxing show. Mr. Bognar likes to sample things right off the production line or, in the case of an oyster harvest in Episode 2 (about Chinese food), right out of the ocean.

This habit gives us a taste, vicariously, of how our food becomes what we know it to be. The paste Mr. Bognar tries in Episode 2 isn’t quite a fortune cookie yet but already has the hints of a fortune cookie’s flavor. In its lightweight way the program is informative and generally leaves us still feeling good enough about the food production process that we won’t be afraid to eat.
619 2010-01-21 In their latest filing with the Los Angeles Superior Court, lawyers for Roman Polanski on Tuesday said officials with the district attorney’s office had “intentionally misled the Swiss” government with a false record of Mr. Polanski’s long-running sex case as a way to secure his extradition from that country. The claim is included in a brief for a planned Friday hearing on whether Mr. Polanski, who in 1978 fled the United States before sentencing on a conviction of having sex with a minor, should now be entitled to sentencing in absentia. “Politics seems to be interfering with the just administration of the law,” wrote Mr. Polanski’s lawyers, Chad S. Hummel and Bart Dalton, in response to a district attorney’s brief arguing that Mr. Polanski should have to appear before sentencing. This month the Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, formed a committee to explore a run for California attorney general. Tuesday’s filing did not specifically mention that possible run for state office, but it said the district attorney’s insistence that Mr. Polanski return to the United States was a “nakedly political” approach to the case. Los Angeles prosecutors have long argued that Mr. Polanski’s fugitive status deprived him of any right to challenge his treatment in California.
620 2010-01-21 LONDON — Six years after using the Patriot Act to revoke the visa of a prominent Muslim academic, the United States State Department reversed itself and said Wednesday that it would no longer bar the scholar from entering the United States.

The decision came in the form of an order signed by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. It paves the way for the scholar, Prof. Tariq Ramadan, to apply for a new visa free of the authorities’ former accusation that he had contributed money to a charity connected to terrorism.

“I am very happy and hopeful that I will be able to visit the United States very soon and to once again engage in an open, critical and constructive dialogue with American scholars and intellectuals,” Professor Ramadan said in a statement.

Professor Ramadan, who is Swiss and is a professor of contemporary Islamic studies at Oxford University, had often visited the United States and in 2004 planned to travel there to take up a position as a tenured professor at the University of Notre Dame. But the Bush administration revoked his visa, and denied him a new one in 2006, citing a provision of the Patriot Act that allows the barring of foreigners who “use a position of prominence within any country to endorse or espouse terrorist activity.”

At first, the government refused to give its reason. But eventually it pointed to evidence that from 1998 to 2002 Professor Ramadan had donated about $1,300 to a Swiss-based charity that in turn provided money to Hamas, the militant Palestinian group. But the professor argued that he had believed the charity had no connections to terrorist activities or to Hamas, and said that he had always condemned terrorism.

Professor Ramadan, backed by civil liberties groups and others, has been fighting the exclusion in the courts. Last summer, a Federal appeals court in Manhattan reversed a lower-court ruling that had upheld the government’s decision to deny him a visa, sending the case back to the lower court for further study.
621 2010-01-21 WASHINGTON — President Obama’s nominee to head the Transportation Security Administration, Erroll Southers, withdrew his name on Wednesday, saying that Republicans had politicized the appointment. The withdrawal was a setback for Mr. Obama’s efforts to allay concerns about airline security after several highly publicized breaches.

"It is clear that my nomination has become a lightning rod for those who have chosen to push a political agenda at the risk of the safety and security of the American people," Mr. Southers, a former F.B.I. agent, said in a statement. "This partisan climate is unacceptable, and I refuse to allow myself to remain part of their dialogue."

The White House accepted Mr. Southers’s decision with regrets. A spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that the nominee “was uniquely qualified for this job, and it is with great sadness that the president accepted Southers’s withdrawal.”

The nomination was strongly opposed by Republicans. Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina had placed a block on the nomination, saying he feared that Mr. Southers would attempt to grant collective bargaining rights to tens of thousands of the agency’s employees, including the 45,000 security screeners who have become a familiar presence at the nation’s airports.

The agency is part of the Department of Homeland Security. About 180,000 government employees lost their union rights in 2002 when President Bush signed the bill creating the department. Mr. Bush contended that after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the new department needed greater flexibility in handling its employees.
622 2010-01-21 Earlier this month in a battle of former No. 1-ranked women, she turned back Henin in the finals of the Brisbane International in what was Henin’s comeback tournament. It reassured Clijsters that she had extra gears and a reservoir of grit to call on in big tournaments.

“You know, I won my matches not always conveniently, but good enough,” said Clijsters, 26, who has reached the semifinals or better in her last four trips to Melbourne Park and lost the 2004 final to Henin. “Played a three-set match there. I was not always playing my best, was a little bit inconsistent.

“When I had to play well against Justine, I was able to really like raise my level,” she said. “That’s something that obviously after having been off for a long time, it takes time to get that, to have that routine of knowing how to react in those kind of situations.”

The collision course the two Belgians are on added drama on a day when big names thumped lesser players on the men’s side. The defending champion, Rafael Nadal, capitalized on five of his first six breakpoints to bounce Lukas Lacko of Slovakia in straight sets — 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. Andy Roddick, the world’s No. 7, did not trifle with Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil, pounding him 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. The 2007 runner-up here, Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, ranked No. 11, took care of business as well, dispatching Marsel Ilhan of Turkey, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5.

Another contender among the women, Svetlana Kuznetsova, looked impressive as she advanced to the third round over her fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in straight sets. Kuznetsova, who won the French Open last year and the 2004 U.S. Open title, can supplant Serena Williams as the world’s No. 1 by winning here.

Kuznetsova said she was a much more confident and determined player than she was last year when she lost to Williams in the quarterfinals after being up a set and a break.

“Yes, definitely, I know all the way how to go — I’ve done it twice,” said Kuznetsova, 24, who won last year’s French Open in Paris. “It’s exciting. You always have different motivation at the Grand Slams. I love to play here.”

But Henin may like it a little more.

“I couldn’t believe I was playing with that kind of emotion,” she said.

Even though the Australian Open has conjured more frustration in the past, Henin chose to embrace her history of elation here. “This was the perfect place for me to come back,” she said.

Henin beat Clijsters here for the 2004 championship. In the 2006 final, she retired in the second set against Amélie Mauresmo because of stomach cramps. She withdrew from the 2007 event because she was going through a divorce. The 2008 Australian Open was her last Grand Slam event before she suddenly retired in May of that year as the world’s top-ranked player.

Still, she is managing her own expectations and has acknowledged it would take an extraordinary run to capture her eighth Grand Slam title. “I’ll need the patience in the next few weeks, a few tournaments to really feel at my level and keep the intensity,” Henin said. “That’s the hardest thing, is to keep always the concentration, the intensity very high. So it’s going to be probably the hardest for me in the next future, next tournaments.”

But she is glad to be back.

“The good thing is that I don’t feel old yet,” she said. “Even if when I came here I realized it was six years ago I won the Australian Open, so it did hit me a little bit. Physically and mentally, I don’t feel like I’m part of the old generation, so that’s good.”

Clijsters, too, is trying to take her return to the elite of women’s tennis one match at a time.

She says she understands that she is a worthy favorite to win the tournament, but that alone does not fast-track her to her the finals and a showdown with Serena Williams.

“My attitude doesn’t change because now I’m seen as one of the favorites,” she said. “To me, that doesn’t mean anything.”
623 2010-01-21 Last month another dissident, Tran Anh Kim, 60, a former army officer, was sentenced to five and a half years in prison, also on the charge of subversion. In October, nine people were sentenced to prison terms of two to six years for hanging banners that called for multiparty democracy.

Foreign governments and human rights groups have spoken out against the continuing crackdown, which has included tighter limits on press freedom and on Internet discussion sites, including political blogs. Access to Facebook has recently been restricted.

During the one-day trial in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Dinh agreed that he had broken the law by meeting with foreign groups and by advocating multiparty democracy in Vietnam. His remarks and details of the court proceedings were reported by journalists and foreign diplomats who were permitted to observe the courtroom on closed-circuit television.

“From the bottom of my heart, I myself and these three other defendants had no intention to overthrow the government,” Mr. Dinh said, according to news reports. He added, “During my studies overseas, I was influenced by Western attitudes toward democracy, freedom and human rights.”

The charges against Mr. Dinh reflect a concern, periodically repeated in the official press, about the destabilizing influence of contacts with the West.

Mr. Dinh acknowledged that he had attended a three-day training course in Thailand on nonviolent political change, sponsored by an overseas Vietnamese political group, Viet Tan.

Mr. Thuc, the blogger, denied the charges, saying he had only been campaigning against corruption and trying to improve the political system. He acknowledged organizing a study group that prosecutors said was dedicated to undermining the government; he said the group was intended only to study issues and make constructive suggestions.

The United States has condemned the arrests, and repeated its concern after the verdict.

“We would like to reiterate our deep concern over the arrest and conviction of persons for the peaceful expression of their beliefs, political or otherwise, by the government of Vietnam,” said Kenneth J. Fairfax, the United States consul general in Ho Chi Minh City.

Last month, the army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said the arrests “are totally legal in Vietnamese law and compatible with international law.” The government guarantees free expression, the newspaper asserted, but “strictly punishes those who take advantage of this freedom to act against the national interest.”

Prosecutors on Wednesday said three of the defendants had violated Article 79 of Vietnam’s criminal code, which prohibits “carrying out activities aimed at overthrowing the people’s administration” and can be punishable by death.

Mr. Dinh, who was arrested in June and made a public confession on television in August, told the court, “My actions were in violation of Article 79, specifically participating in the Democratic Party of Vietnam, whose purpose was to call for a multiparty system, pluralism and a new state.”

The Democratic Party, like all independent parties, is banned in Vietnam’s one-party state and has become a focus of dissident activity and a target in the continuing crackdown.

Mr. Dinh, who studied law at Tulane University, is a former vice chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City bar association and once represented the government in a legal dispute with the United States over exports of Vietnamese catfish.

More recently he defended human rights advocates in court, where he spoke strongly in defense of free speech, and he published essays about democracy on the Internet.

His words in a court appearance in 2007 contrasted with his admission of guilt on Wednesday.

“Talking about democracy and human rights cannot be seen as antigovernment unless the government is against democracy,” he said then.
624 2010-01-21 A result, analysts said, is a tug of war that turns on each fresh data point.

“This is the first time in almost a year and a half there hasn’t been a consensus opinion of what this market should do,” Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, said. “2010 hasn’t really decided what it wants to be when it grows up.”

As investors found safer havens, the dollar strengthened against other currencies, reaching $1.41 against the euro.

Renewed concern that businesses would continue to suffer deep losses helped bring shares down, investors said. Wall Street is in the middle of earnings season, when companies report quarterly results. The results have been mixed, with many firms failing to satisfy Wall Street’s demand that they show healthy growth in revenue, not just nimble cost-cutting.

The financial sector, saddled with heavy losses on credit cards and mortgages, continued to disappoint investors on Wednesday.

Morgan Stanley added to fears over the vitality of banks when it reported revenue in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion, or 29 cents in earnings per diluted share. Analysts had expected $7.8 billion in revenue, or 36 cents a share. Shares of Morgan Stanley fell 1.7 percent.

By contrast, shares of Bank of America, which reported a worse-than-expected loss of $5.2 billion but indicated some stability in losses on consumer loans, rose 1.04 percent.

Despite a relatively strong earnings report, investors seemed to be demanding more from the technology sector. I.B.M. fell 2.90 percent on Wednesday, even after the technology giant said its net income was $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, or $3.59 a share, up 10 percent from the previous year.

There were fears about the pace of the global recovery after Chinese authorities signaled on Wednesday that bank lending would slow significantly as the country tried to check inflation.

The China Banking Regulatory Commission said it expected Chinese banks to extend loans totaling about 7.5 trillion renminbi ($1.1 trillion) — down nearly 22 percent from the record 9.6 trillion renminbi last year. That prompted concerns that businesses might not have access to enough money to expand and build staffing levels.

In Europe, markets closed down after the European Central Bank policy maker Jürgen Stark said the bank would not give Greece special treatment as the country sought to reduce its deficit.

“Greece knows that it has to catch up on its homework,” Mr. Stark said, according to Reuters.

The FTSE 100 in London fell 1.67 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt tumbled 2.09 percent.

Investors were also concerned by another dreary figure on the United States housing market. The pace of home construction fell 4 percent in December, the government said, during an unusually cold and wet month. Building permits, however, surged to the highest level in a year, indicating future construction would probably be more robust than expected.

Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader’s Almanac, said the market was “ripe for a pullback” after ignoring signs of weakness in fourth-quarter earnings reports and disappointing economic figures, including the country’s 10 percent unemployment rate.

“The market has been pricing in a pretty robust and unwavering recovery,” Mr. Hirsch said. “The sell-off today is the market coming back to the reality that it did get a little bit ahead of itself, and that we’re probably going to have some struggles going forward.”

Interest rates were lower. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 97 25/32 and the yield fell to 3.65 percent, from 3.70 percent late Tuesday.

Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of four-week bills:
625 2010-01-21 Bobby Bognar seems willing to eat almost anything. But about once an episode on his new show, “Food Tech,” he encounters something even he is compelled to spit out.

In the opening installment, Thursday night on History, it’s a pickle that is only partway through the debrining-and-flavor-enhancing process. In Episode 2 it’s a crunchy sediment that is a byproduct of the creation of soy sauce.

Whatever the proper etiquette is for quietly removing something unpleasant from your mouth, Mr. Bognar doesn’t follow it; he just spews the stuff out. It’s kind of endearing, in a gag-inducing way.

“Endearing” is what might set this late-to-the-dance show apart from the numerous other television offerings about food and where it comes from. Mr. Bognar, whose credentials seem to be that he has worked in a broad range of food-industry jobs and is in a Los Angeles rock band, is nothing if not genial.

642 2010-01-22 Since there are ballets with lively roles for dancers playing dogs — notably Massine’s “Boutique Fantasque,” Ashton’s “Wedding Bouquet” and Balanchine’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream” — it may disappoint you to hear that nobody dances the role of the dog in Alexey Miroshnichenko’s new ballet of Chekhov’s story “The Lady With the Little Dog,” a production that had its premiere at New York City Ballet on Wednesday night. Though the cast includes eight men, some of whom perform distinctly doggy movements at the start, the program tells us they are Angels.

There are, however, no Angels in Chekhov’s story about two married lovers. Confused? Mr. Miroshnichenko’s ballet does have a dog: a little adorable one, very well-behaved on Wednesday. I wish its role were larger. Sterling Hyltin plays its owner, Anna Sergeevna, one of the lovers, and the way she attends to it as she promenades across the stage on her entrance casts a glow upon both the animal and her. Farewell, good dog. (It is Ms. Hyltin’s own.)

Meanwhile, some Angels crawl on all fours after her and it, and others after Andrew Veyette, who plays Dmitri Dmitrievitch, while more Angels slowly unroll a length of striped marley (floor covering) across the stage. The Angels in “The Lady With the Little Dog” are part stagehands, part bunraku puppeteers (manipulating hero and heroine through space), part chorus. But they’re also just part fill-in.

The marley, which they roll and unroll to bisect the stage in different ways during the story, may indicate the barriers between Anna and Dmitri. At the end, hero and heroine are serenely together, walking along the tape up the center of the stage into the horizon, while the Angels, recumbent, raise their heads to watch them go. I applaud Mr. Miroshnichenko in not weighing his ballet down with literal depictions of Chekhov’s details, but then I wish he weren’t even tackling Chekhov, whose prose makes detail upon tiny detail piercingly significant and multifaceted.

Mr. Miroshnichenko, like a few other choreographers who have tried turning Chekhov into choreography, just isn’t artist enough to make much of Chekhov’s narrative or his own somewhat different one. He uses the score that Rodion Shchedrin composed for his wife, the celebrated Russian ballerina Maya Plisetskaya. She choreographed and danced it in 1985 for her 60th birthday; and this ballet is dedicated to her in honor of her 85th birthday. The music is efficient, agreeable, shrewd in the way it changes orchestration at different stages of the story. Ms. Plisetskaya also choreographed “The Seagull” and “Anna Karenina.” I missed “Lady With the Little Dog,” but everything I did see of her work suggests that she felt a crude narrative outline and some passionately gestural dances were enough to evoke the essence of supreme literary masterpieces.

The aesthetics of later Soviet ballet — echoed and perhaps stimulated by all too many choreographers from Western Europe — permitted many such vainglorious efforts. Nobody there seemed to point out that the terrible expressive limitations of the choreography were not redeemed by such important subject matter but made all the more flagrant. Mr. Miroshnichenko — like the far more absurd but prestigious Boris Eifman — is one of the post-Soviet generation who have not outgrown the ghastly overambitiousness of the old climate.
643 2010-01-22 New census figures that provide a snapshot of America’s foreign-born population are challenging conventional views of immigration, race and ethnicity.

What it means to be African-American, for example, may be redefined by the record number of blacks  now nearly 1 in 10  born abroad, according to the report from American Community Survey data, which was released Wednesday. It found that Africa now accounts for one in three foreign-born blacks in this country, another modern record.

More than 1 in 50 Americans now identify themselves as “multiracial.” But the pattern of race reporting for foreign-born Americans, is markedly different than for native-born Americans. The foreign born are more likely to list their nation of origin when identifying race or ethnicity.

For example, while 87 percent of Americans born in Cuba and 53 percent born in Mexico identified themselves as white, a majority born in the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, who are newer immigrants, described themselves as neither black nor white.

“The concept of race and how we view it culturally has changed,” said Elizabeth M. Grieco, chief of the Census Bureau’s immigration statistics staff, which analyzed 2007 data. “It’s a part of not knowing where they fit into how we define race in the United States.”

Recent arrivals “might not be sure how to classify themselves,” Dr. Grieco said. (The census treats race and Hispanic origin as separate categories.)

The changing perception of race is being driven largely by immigration and higher birthrates among the foreign born. While immigrants account for 13 percent of the population, the share of recent births to foreign-born mothers rose to 20 percent. As a result of intermarriage with native-born Americans, a growing number of American children  now more than one in four under the age of 6  are being raised by at least one foreign-born parent.

“It’s fair to say that we are approaching the shares seen at the peak of the last great immigration wave” at the beginning of the 20th century, said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center.

Kenneth M. Johnson, senior demographer at the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire, noted that more that two-thirds of the growth of the Hispanic population last year came from births, not immigration.

“You could shut off immigration tomorrow and the impact of the foreign born on U.S. demographic trends would still be a powerful force,” he said.

Among the nation’s 37.3 million blacks, more than 8 percent are now foreign born, compared with 1 percent in 1960. Of those, more than half came from the Caribbean. Some 34 percent emigrated from Africa, compared with 1 percent in 1960.

The census recorded 10,500 American blacks born in Africa in 1970; in 2008, the number of African-born Americans topped one million for the first time.

Seventy-eight percent of native-born Americans reported their race as white, followed by 13 percent who said they were black. Among the foreign born, 46 percent identified themselves as white and 23 percent as Asian.

Since 2000, the Hispanic foreign-born population has increased 45 percent, to 18.5 million from 12.8 million. Latin Americans represent more than half of the foreign-born population.

Among all who identified themselves as Asian-Americans, which is often understood to mean born here, 67 percent were, in fact, foreign born.

How immigrants translate their own backgrounds and report their adopted identities “have important implications for the nation’s racial and ethnic composition,” the Census Bureau said in the report.

Nicholas A. Jones, chief of the bureau’s racial statistics branch, said that given the likelihood that foreign-born people would identify themselves as German or Irish or Nigerian instead of black or white, the bureau might eventually encourage people to provide more detailed write-in answers to how they define themselves.
644 2010-01-22 DeCode Genetics, the gene-hunting company in Iceland, said Thursday that it had emerged from bankruptcy and would continue its genetics research and its gene-based diagnostics as a private company. It will abandon its efforts to develop drugs from its discoveries.

The company, which is based in Reykjavik, has led the world in using knowledge of the human genome to detect genes associated with the risk of common diseases, like schizophrenia, cancer and heart disease. But despite the high quality of its research, the company was unable to translate its findings into enough marketable products and ran out of money in November.

In its new form, the company will be run by a new chief executive, Earl Collier, and by its founder, Dr. Kari Stefansson. Mr. Collier, a lawyer, was previously a vice president of Genzyme and a member of DeCode’s board. Dr. Stefansson will give up the post of chief executive and become head of research.

The new DeCode is owned by Saga Investments, an alliance that includes two leading life science investment companies, Polaris Ventures and ARCH Venture Partners. Terrance McGuire, a general partner at Polaris, said DeCode had been recapitalized because its research and database, formed from the medical records of the Icelandic population, were a valuable asset. “From an investor’s perspective, it was the power of the content being created,” he said.

Mr. Collier will be based in the Boston area, an arrangement he said was not unusual for a chief executive. He said he was not yet ready to discuss DeCode’s long-range plans.

Dr. Stefansson said that the company’s genetic research in Iceland would carry on just as before and that DeCode would “continue to outperform” its mostly university-based rivals in the United States and England. The commercial operation will be lead by Mr. Collier in the United States, Dr. Stefansson said.
645 2010-01-22 DETROIT — Toyota Motor issued its second large recall in two months on Thursday to fix a problem with accelerator pedals that can get stuck, causing vehicles to speed up unintentionally.

Toyota said that it did not yet have a solution but in the meantime instructed drivers who experience a stuck pedal to brake with “firm and steady” pressure. The recall covers 2.3 million cars and trucks from model years 2005 through 2010 and is separate from a November recall of 4.2 million vehicles that was the largest in Toyota’s history. About 1.7 million vehicles are included in both recalls, including its best-selling model, the Camry.

The first recall was to fix a design flaw that could cause the gas pedal to become trapped under the floor mat. But the automaker continued to be dogged by reports of unintended acceleration and stuck pedals even in cases where the floor mats had been removed, a stopgap measure recommended by Toyota.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been looking into two recent incidents in Texas and New Jersey, and was considering starting an investigation. Four people died on Dec. 26 near Dallas when a Toyota Avalon sped off a road and into a pond. Police found the floor mats in the Avalon’s trunk.

Until Thursday, Toyota had denied that there was a mechanical or electronic problem with the pedals. The company said the problem was “rare” but could result in a worn gas pedal being difficult to depress, slow to spring back or getting stuck partly depressed.

“Our investigation indicates that there is a possibility that certain accelerator pedal mechanisms may, in rare instances, mechanically stick in a partially depressed position or return slowly to the idle position,” said Irv Miller, a group vice president of Toyota Motors Sales U.S.A.

This recall includes the 2005-10 Avalon; 2007-10 Camry and Tundra; 2008-10 Sequoia; 2009-10 RAV4, Corolla and Matrix; and 2010 Highlander. It also covers the 2009-10 Pontiac Vibe, a mechanical twin to the Matrix. It does not include the Prius hybrid, which was in the November recall, or Lexus or Scion models.
646 2010-01-22 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Advanced Micro Devices, which makes computer microprocessors, said on Thursday that it posted its first quarterly profit in three years because it received $1.25 billion in a legal settlement with the Intel Corporation.

A.M.D. said that it would have lost money were it not for the payment it received from Intel to end a long-running antitrust battle.

But A.M.D. also appeared to benefit from an upturn in the overall computer market. Revenue was up 42 percent from last year, and unit sales of microprocessors and graphics chips rose, even though prices fell.

Intel, which kicked off the technology earnings season last week, reported better sales in all its major product categories and the highest gross profit margin in the company’s history. This week I.B.M. raised its profit forecast for 2010 and reported better sales of the types of computer servers that use A.M.D. and Intel chips. And on Thursday, Gartner, the technology research firm, predicted that worldwide spending on information technology in 2010 would improve at a faster rate than expected.

A.M.D. said after the market closed that it made $1.2 billion, or $1.52 a share, in the period ended Dec. 26, compared with $1.4 billion, or $2.36 a share, last year.

Excluding the settlement and other items, A.M.D. lost $57 million, or 8 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a loss of 18 cents a share, excluding items.
647 2010-01-22 BERLIN — Three months after the United States announced a reformulated missile-defense plan for Poland, the Polish defense minister has announced that American surface-to-air missiles will be deployed near Russian soil.

The minister, Bogdan Klich, said Wednesday that an undisclosed number of missiles would be deployed in the vicinity of Morag, in northern Poland, just 35 miles from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. He said the missiles could arrive as soon as late March or early April.

He said the decision to base the missiles near Morag, and not Warsaw, had no political or strategic significance. “The only reason was the good infrastructure,” Mr. Klich said.

The United States had promised the missiles to Poland in October, after President Obama had scrapped a missile-defense system proposed by President George W. Bush.

Morag is already home to a Polish military base. Mr. Klich said it could easily be adapted to the needs of the new missile battery and the American soldiers who would be based in Poland once the missiles were sent there.

While the placement of the missiles so close to Russia could be seen as provocative, Russia denied a report that it planned to increase the arsenal of its Baltic Fleet in response to Poland’s announcement.

“No changes are planned in the combat components of the Baltic Fleet in connection with the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles close to the border with Russia,” the Defense Ministry said Thursday in a statement carried by news agencies.
648 2010-01-22 Mr. Fleming, who supported affirmative action, negotiated an agreement with student leaders calling for an increase in financing for recruiting qualified black applicants and setting a 10 percent enrollment goal without committing to it as a quota.

Reaction to the settlement was polarized. Some hailed Mr. Fleming for finding a compromise position, but Vice President Spiro T. Agnew called the settlement an appeasement to radicals, “the University of Michigan’s callow retreat from reality.”

Weeks later four student protesters at Kent State University in Ohio were killed by National Guardsmen and a protest at Jackson State University in Mississippi left two students dead. Afterward, Mr. Fleming gave testimony to the President’s Commission on Campus Unrest.

“It may be better to suffer some damage and then invoke the university’s disciplinary procedures than to resort to force,” Mr. Fleming said.

Robben Wright Fleming was born in tiny Paw Paw, Ill., west of Chicago, on Dec. 18, 1916. His father, who died of tuberculosis when Robben was 16, ran a general store. His mother, a teacher, presided over Paw Paw’s one-room school house.

Mr. Fleming graduated from Beloit College in Wisconsin and University of Wisconsin Law School. He worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington and briefly for the National War Labor Board, helping to end a strike by thousands of employees at the Western Cartridge Company in Alton, Ill. He joined the Army in 1942 and served as a lawyer in Europe and North Africa, helping to restore governments to cities that had been recaptured by the Allies.

After the war he became director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations at the University of Wisconsin and took a similar post at the University of Illinois.

In 1964, he became chancellor of the University of Wisconsin. He used his negotiating skills three years later when students demonstrated against the campus presence of recruiters for the Dow Chemical Company, which was manufacturing napalm for the Vietnam War.

Accounts of the episode differ — some say Mr. Fleming was barricaded in his office — but after the police were called and several students were arrested, Mr. Fleming covered their bail with a personal check. The University of Michigan hired him shortly thereafter.

“The regents went after him especially to deal with student conflict,” said Will Hathaway, who wrote about Mr. Fleming’s tenure in a doctoral dissertation at Eastern Michigan University.

Mr. Fleming’s wife, the former Aldyth Louise Quixley, whom he married in 1942, died in 2005. In addition to his son, of Mount Horeb, Wis., he is survived by two daughters, Nancy Jo Reckord, of Eugene, Ore., and Carolyn DiMaggio, of Saline, Mich.; five grandchildren, and a great-grandson.

After leaving Michigan, Mr. Fleming spent two years as president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He returned briefly to Michigan as interim president in 1988, succeeding Harold Shapiro, who left to become president of Princeton.

“No matter how outrageous the actions before him were,” Mr. Shapiro said of Mr. Fleming, “I always felt he had a way of maintaining his and our balance.”
649 2010-01-22 Indeed, Mr. Obama acknowledged that “an army of industry lobbyists” had already descended on Capitol Hill, but vowed, “If these folks want a fight, it’s a fight I’m ready to have.”

Shares of big banks — potentially the biggest losers should the proposals be enacted — fell sharply, dragging the broader market down by about 2 percent. Even as the markets stumbled, Mr. Obama — still stinging from the Democrats’ loss on Tuesday of the seat formerly held by Senator — ramped up his populist approach, one week after he proposed a new on large financial institutions to recoup projected losses from the 2008 bailout.

Mr. Obama said the banks had nearly wrecked the economy by taking “huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses.”

The administration wants to ban bank holding companies from owning, investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or funds and from engaging in proprietary trading, or trading on their own accounts, as opposed to the money of their customers.

Mr. Obama called the ban the Volcker Rule, in recognition of the former Federal Reserve chairman, , who has championed the proposal. Big losses by banks in the trading of financial securities, especially mortgage-backed assets, precipitated the credit crisis in 2008 and the federal bailout.

It was not clear, however, how proprietary trading activities would be defined.

Officials said that banks would not be permitted to use their own capital for “trading unrelated to serving customers.” Such a restriction would most likely compel banks that own hedge funds and private equity funds to dispose of them over time. Officials said, however, that executing trades on a client’s behalf and using bank capital to make a market or to hedge a client’s risk would be permissible.

Federal regulators have already leaned hard on banks to curb pure proprietary trading, and the banks expect that regulators will demand more capital if they keep making risky bets, making the practice far less profitable.

Some of the biggest firms, applying a narrow definition, say that pure proprietary trading constituted less than 10 percent of their revenue, and in some cases far less. , for example, already abandoned all but two proprietary trading desks last year.

The Buckingham Research Group estimated that the new rules would reduce revenue at , and by less than 3 percent. , which typically derives a tenth of its revenue from such trading, said it would be able to contend with the new rules.

“I would say pure walled-off proprietary-trading businesses at Goldman Sachs are not very big in the context of the firm,” David A. Viniar, the firm’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call.

Mr. Obama also is seeking to limit consolidation in the financial sector, by placing curbs on the market share of liabilities at the largest firms. Since 1994, the share of insured deposits that can be held by any one bank has been capped at 10 percent.

The administration wants to expand that cap to include all liabilities, to limit the concentration of too much risk in any single bank. Officials said the measure would prevent banks at or near the threshold from making acquisitions but would not require them to shrink their business or stop growing on their own.

The Obama administration said the new proposals were in the “spirit of ” — a reference to the Depression-era law that separated commercial and banking, which was repealed in 1999.

Economists have debated whether the repeal of that act contributed to the crisis. The two big investment banks that imploded, and , were not commercial banks, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to bank holding companies only after the system started to come unglued.

The industry was left buzzing with questions about timing and scope. Officials said the new restrictions would apply to overseas firms, like and , with large American operations, but it was not clear how — or whether — foreign governments would go along. Officials also said the proposal called for a “reasonable transition period” for firms to comply with the rules, but the timetable was not specified.

, the secretary, and , the president’s chief economic adviser, developed the proposals at the request of the president and worked closely with Mr. Volcker, according to White House officials. The plan was completed over the holidays and submitted to the president with a unanimous recommendation from the economic team.

While Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers debated concerns that proprietary trading was not at the heart of the recent crisis, they concluded that reforms needed to address potential sources of risk in the future.

Reaction on Capitol Hill also was muted, partly because neither party wanted to be seen as beholden to unpopular banks. The House bill passed last month would consolidate oversight, require stronger capital cushions for the largest banks and impose regulation of some . In many ways, the new White House proposal amplifies provisions in that bill that would have left regulators discretion over proprietary trading and excessive liability.

Mickelson had said after winning the HSBC Champions in Shanghai in November that he would take 10 weeks off and return at Torrey Pines, where he has won three times but not since 2001.

The tournament earlier this week found a title sponsor, but not much of a field. Mickelson is the only player from the top 10 in the world, with Robert Allenby and Ernie Els making it three out of the top 20.

657 2010-01-23 The chemical BPA has been used in consumer products since 1910. The first evidence that it was estrogenic in animals came in the mid-1930s.

There is no debate that BPA leaches from plastic into our food and that it is found in the bodies of more than 90 percent of Americans tested, including infants.

More than 100 studies have reported significant effects of BPA on animals; nearly half of these studies involved doses currently considered safe by regulatory agencies.

How long does it take to ban a harmful chemical from entering our food and water? From previous examples like DDT, PCBs and alar, the answer is between 25 and 50 years from the time scientists first learn of its potential harm. The reason for this is that our society has adopted an unusually high burden of proof before a chemical can be regulated or banned.

Until we change this, endocrine disruptors like BPA, which are biologically active in human cells and potentially dangerous to the developing fetus, will likely be around for another 20 years.

The writer, a professor in the department of urban and environmental policy and planning at Tufts University, is the author of “Hormonal Chaos: The Scientific and Social Origins of the Environmental Endocrine Hypothesis” and a board member of the Council for Responsible Genetics.

Your article refers to “activists on both sides of the passionately debated issue,” as if BPA had supporters as well as detractors among the citizenry.

As it turns out, however, the pro-BPA “activists” cited in the article consist exclusively of companies that make and use BPA, represented by the American Chemistry Council.

The BPA saga is a classic American tale of marginalized, underresourced nonprofit groups agitating for the public good against entrenched commercial interests. To apply the “activist” mantle to the latter is a grave distortion.

Calling the statement by the Food and Drug Administration about the plastic additive bisphenol-A “a shift in position” from the Bush era is an overstatement.

In 2008, the F.D.A. ignored recommendations of its advisory board and several other government scientific bodies when it determined that BPA is safe. That decision, large portions of which were drafted by chemical industry lobbyists, relied on a couple of industry-financed studies. It contradicted hundreds of studies showing that at extremely low doses BPA causes numerous reproductive abnormalities and other health effects related to the endocrine system, like obesity and diabetes.

In the recent F.D.A. announcement, the agency has not determined that BPA is unsafe. Rather, it suggests that people limit their own exposure to BPA. Such guidance is reminiscent of the Bush administration and other anti-regulation advocates.

An agency whose mandate is to protect public health once again abdicates its responsibility, instead telling consumers that the burden of protection is theirs. By failing to take swift action to ban BPA, the F.D.A. erodes confidence that the administration is about change.

The Food and Drug Administration says that regarding bisphenol-A, used widely in plastics, it had “some concern” about its safety, but there was no proof that it was dangerous to humans. Isn’t it wrong to allow its continued use in the absence of proof that it is harmful? Isn’t it the F.D.A.’s duty to prohibit the use of a potentially dangerous substance until after there is proof that it is safe?

Whose interest is paramount, the public’s or the manufacturers’?
658 2010-01-23 “That was the team that we had to take with us,” Ryan said. “Wherever we went, we were going to take each other.”

When the Jets hired Ryan a year ago, he told Pettine in person. His first phone call went to Thurman.

“Get your stuff ready,” Pettine recalled Ryan saying. “We’re going to New York.”

Ryan and Pettine came from impressive coaching stock. Ryan’s father, Buddy, made the 46 defense famous with the Chicago Bears. Pettine’s father, Mike Sr., spent 33 years carving a legendary high school career in Pennsylvania.

For all they held in common, their differences — race, size, appearance, stature — also stood out. Pettine, who is bald, had experience in video. Ryan owned the biggest belly, the loudest mouth, and he struck the others as the most loyal person they ever met. Thurman boasted the most impressive playing career, first as an all-American safety at the University of Southern California and then nine years in the N.F.L., mostly with the Dallas Cowboys.

Even the baseball teams they rooted for — the Yankees (Thurman), the Philadelphia Phillies (Pettine) and the Chicago Cubs (Ryan) — showed three men with different tastes.

As defensive coaches, they had schemed for every offense ever invented — from the Wing T to the Run and Shoot. Pettine became, according to Jets linebacker Bart Scott, who also played for them in Baltimore, Ryan’s “prized pupil,” a coach who knows this defense as well as Ryan himself.

When Thurman spent last season out of football, Pettine and Ryan talked often about how their inner circle no longer felt complete. Reunited this season, they have resumed their old routine. On game day, Pettine sits upstairs, and Thurman mostly stands directly behind Ryan on the sideline. Players say the three speak their own language, tell inside jokes, all while not diminishing their relationships with other coaches.

“The chemistry that we have on game day, when it flows, it’s like, Wow,” Thurman said.

The results were also similar. The Jets’ defense finished the season ranked first in the N.F.L. in several categories, including total defense and scoring defense. Pettine believes this stems from the chemistry among the Sack Pack, the way they refuse to take football, or themselves, too seriously.

In the defensive meeting room, their first rule is that players must have skin like an armadillo’s, and although they recognize that armadillos have shells, not skin, they constantly reiterate this point. Players are even fined for being too sensitive.

These rules extend to coaches. After a recent sauna session with his inner circle, Ryan claimed he was bloated from drinking water.

“I don’t think it’s the water,” Thurman said as the room exploded into laughter.

Sometimes, they fight like the brothers they have become. Pettine, the Phillies fan, took an exceptional beating during the World Series by Thurman, the Yankee fan. Pettine chalked the arguments up to three men, all competitive, all intense, but all pulling rope in the same direction.

When Ryan talks about the three coaches, he refers to them as “we.”

“He’s one of those guys that once he gets to know you, he likes you, you’re in,” Thurman said. “You’ll be in for the rest of your life. He’s just that kind of guy.”

To Douglas, that speaks to Ryan’s loyalty, to his propensity for keeping confidants close. Ryan also hired Jeff Weeks, his college roommate at Southwest Oklahoma State, as a defensive assistant, and Doug Plank, the player whose number Ryan’s father used to coin the 46 defense.

The Sack Pack still convenes at The Side Bar on occasion, although it has become more difficult as Ryan has become, in Thurman’s words, “a megastar around here.”

That is where Ryan seems most at ease, on a couch, cigar in hand, surrounded by his crew.

Sometimes, they look back at the plan they hatched and marvel at how it unfolded so quickly, in only their first season with the Jets.

“It’s weird in that it’s something that we talked about,” Thurman said. “A lot of times, it doesn’t turn out that way. We envisioned going somewhere and being successful. And here we are.”

One win from the Super Bowl, two wins from the ultimate victory cigar.

Shaun Ellis practiced Friday with his broken left hand heavily wrapped but said he expected to play. Ellis will have a hard time grasping opponents because his hand will be wrapped in a fist. Coach Rex Ryan said he planned to play Ellis as much as he normally does. Kerry Rhodes, who banged his knee Thursday in practice, said he would play. . . . Ryan said he was a little surprised to hear that souvenirs proclaiming the Jets as A.F.C. champions were on sale, until he was told that the Colts and both N.F.C. conference finalists also have souvenirs for sale. “You can’t buy a four-extra-large T-shirt anyway, so I don’t care about that stuff,” Ryan said.
659 2010-01-23 Like all tourism-related companies, the Asian chains have lost revenue during the economic downturn. In 2008, Banyan Tree Holdings had sales of 427.9 million Singapore dollars ($305 million), nearly double that of 2004, attesting to its rapid expansion. In the third quarter of last year, however, the Singapore company’s revenue fell 14 percent from a year earlier. But its operating profit increased 70 percent, reflecting strong performance in hotel management and investment.

Mandarin Oriental operates 25 hotels, including 12 in Asia, 8 in the Americas, and 5 in Europe and North Africa. It has 16 more under development. In November the chain issued an interim management statement saying that weak demand from both the corporate and leisure segments continued to put pressure on occupancy levels and average room rates in all regions. But conditions in Europe were better than in Asia and the Americas, it noted.

Ho Kwon Ping, executive chairman of Banyan Tree Holdings, said the projects that were about to open would have been decided on as long as three years ago, at the height of a tourism boom — “when everybody was toppish about Europe,” he said. “What you’re seeing now is the outgrowth to that.”

Mr. Ho said he believed Asian brands’ decisions to move into Europe reflected the confluence of two things: “First, European developers are looking toward the Asian market, and also an Asian kind of hospitality, to distinguish themselves from the European brands. Second, Asian brands themselves are looking toward extending to other parts of the world, partly to satisfy the demand from Asian tourists traveling more and more toward other parts of the world.”

Economic indicators suggest that European markets are unlikely to recover as quickly as Asian markets. Worldwide international tourist arrivals fell 4 percent last year amid the severe global economic crisis, and Europe was hit harder, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. European arrivals declined 6 percent on an annual basis, compared with a 2 percent decline in the Asia-Pacific region and a 5 percent slide in the Americas.

Hotrec, a trade association of hotels, restaurants and cafes in the European Union, recently said that hospitality business trends across Europe were still very worrying and that a recovery was currently not in sight in many European member states.

“Occupancy rates of hotels in all major cities in Europe went down between January and August, compared to the same period of 2008,” Marguerite Sequaris, the chief executive of Hotrec, wrote in an e-mail message, adding that the rates for major destinations such as London, Paris and Rome fell by less than five percentage points but that the overall picture was showing a more severe decline.

“Most participants to the general assembly reported calamitous business trends in their respective countries,” she added, “and most consider that the recovery is not in sight yet, as 2010 will probably be on the same level as 2009.”

Tourist arrivals in Spain, one of Europe’s top tourist destinations, fell 8.7 percent last year on an annual basis, according to a recent report on the sector by the Spanish secretary of state for tourism, Joan Mesquida. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the latest figures available for some of the European countries, for September and October, still show a decline in occupancy rates.

But Asian brands are pushing ahead with global expansion plans.

“This is part of the group’s growth strategy to extend our presence to key cities and sought-after resort destinations where there is demand for luxury travel and dining experiences,” said John Johnston, president of Raffles Hotels and Resorts.

Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a research company in New York, said that Asian brands’ reputation among wealthy Europeans for providing top facilities and highly rated customer experiences gave the brands fairly high chances of success.

“Mandarin Oriental has already proven its viability in competitive markets such as London,” he said. “As long as they stick to a few major cities or locations in Europe, the Asian brands have low risk of becoming too ubiquitous.”

George Morgan-Grenville, group managing director of Abercrombie & Kent, a high-end travel agent and tour operator based in Britain, said he believed that Asian brands would be “warmly welcomed” in Europe in part because they were “built around an intrinsic service culture.”

“What Asian brands seem to grasp more profoundly than their Western counterparts is a more holistic approach to a guest’s stay, from remembering names to dealing with the smallest detail,” Mr. Morgan-Grenville said.

“Of course, when brands migrate West, the danger is they face some tough competition from established hotel brands who already know how to operate effectively under Western economic conditions,” he added. “But the fact remains that, culturally, the Asian brands have been quick to grasp consumer needs in the 21st century.”
660 2010-01-23 Officials from each bank declined to comment on Friday.

Allowing Goldman, or other institutions, to abandon their bank charters carries risks. Such a plan could create a two-tier system, where Goldman could pursue business activities different from its bailed-out peers like JPMorgan Chase. Goldman would lose access to the Federal Reserve’s overnight lending program, which provides emergency financing. But investors may still assume that the government would bail out Goldman if it had trouble, elevating the risk of moral hazard.

Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said allowing either bank to revert to a securities firm would do little to address the underlying problem. They are so large and interconnected that a collapse would imperil the global financial system, he said.

“You can call them an investment bank, a hedge fund, or a banana, but they are still too big to fail,” Mr. Johnson said.

Andrew Williams, a Treasury spokesman, confirmed that the proposal would allow the banks to reverse their decision to become bank holding companies. But he said the Fed would still closely regulate companies like Goldman because they would still be systemically important.

“There is no escape hatch,” he said. “There is nowhere to hide. Large, interconnected, highly leveraged financial firms must be regulated on a comprehensive, consolidated basis, the same as those for big firms who run banks.”

While bank holding company status is generally permanent, investors have speculated for months that Goldman might seek a way to unshackle itself from some of the additional government regulation that goes with it.

Goldman officials have said privately it would like to shed its holding company status, although they have stated publicly that they do not plan to change the company’s charter. On Thursday, David A. Viniar, the bank’s chief financial officer, said the topic was not under discussion.

“I just think it’s unrealistic,” Mr. Viniar said in a call with reporters. “I think we’re living in a world where basically every major financial institution is going to be regulated by the Fed.”

But Goldman could change its tune if the Treasury created guidelines for banks to shed their holding company status.

The first step for Goldman would be to dispose of its debt, which is backed by the government, or wait until it expires in about two years, the person with knowledge of the plan said.

In addition to the federal bailout, the government agreed that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would back some bank debt issued when the markets were frozen and banks could not otherwise raise money. Goldman has issued $21 billion of the debt.

The Treasury will include the exit strategy in the legislative proposal it is preparing to send to Congress, Mr. Williams said. Lawmakers could make significant changes to the proposal.

The plan does not now clarify what proprietary trading activities would be limited. Officials said banks would not be permitted to use their own capital for “trading unrelated to serving customers.” They also said that the rules would require banks that own hedge funds and private equity funds to dispose of them over several years.

Mr. Obama called the ban on trading “the Volcker Rule,” in recognition of the former Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, who has championed the proposal to prohibit bank holding companies from owning, investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds and from engaging in proprietary trading. Big losses by banks in the trading of financial securities helped fuel the credit crisis in 2008.
661 2010-01-23 “We asked for concessions, and they said no,” he said, according to the notes. “I wonder why we even bothered.” Mr. Baxter also said that Mr. Geithner verbally approved the decision to pay full price to the banks.

A spokesman for the Treasury Department noted that Mr. Geithner’s decision to give the banks 100 cents on the dollar in the A.I.G. bailout was previously discussed in a report that the Treasury’s inspector general released last fall.

According to a 13-page slide show prepared by the asset management firm BlackRock that was submitted to the committee, Merrill Lynch and a French bank, Société Générale, were “resistant to deep concessions” on their A.I.G. contracts. Goldman Sachs, another major trading partner, was willing to accept only “a small concession” on its contracts.

The slide show is among more than 250,000 pages of documents provided to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in preparation for a hearing next week on the Fed’s role in the A.I.G. bailout. The committee, which is led by Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, has been interviewing some of the people who will testify, including Mr. Baxter.

In October 2008, one month after the A.I.G. rescue was initiated, the New York Fed encountered heavy objections to its plans for structuring the bailout from its overseers at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. The New York Fed had recommended creating two vehicles — known as Maiden Lane 2 and Maiden Lane 3 — to house securities taken in as part of the A.I.G. rescue. A similar vehicle had been created to hold the assets guaranteed by the government in the Bear Stearns collapse.

In an Oct. 15 e-mail message to Mr. Geithner, Sarah Dahlgren, the New York Fed official leading the A.I.G. effort, wrote, “Board staff again reiterated that they didn’t think that the Governors (unnamed) would go for ML2 or ML3.” Later in the same e-mail message, Ms. Dahlgren noted, “The Governors have cited the Bear Stearns deal as a one-off deal that was done on the understanding it wouldn’t be done again (so ML2 and ML3 aren’t well-received...)”

The e-mail message also summarized the board’s questions about the bailout. Atop the list: “What does any of this buy us?”

Plenty, said the Treasury Department in a statement on Friday evening.

“Those investments have turned out to be very sensible, and the fund at the center of the controversy is on track to return every dollar to taxpayers, and may well yield a profit,” said Andrew Williams, a Treasury spokesman.

The Fed was advised that the banks had valued the contracts in question at severely depressed levels. The contracts were tied to bundles of mortgage bonds known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s.

A senior New York Fed official wrote in an Oct. 22 e-mail message to Mr. Geithner that there was a “discrepancy” between “what our advisers are saying these C.D.O.’s are worth and where the firms have them marked.”

Some of the banks seemed to recognize that the mortgage bundles might wind up being worth more than they were claiming at the time. According to BlackRock’s slide show, Goldman and Société Générale were willing to tear up some of the contracts with A.I.G. if they were allowed to keep the underlying C.D.O.’s, indicating that both banks may have thought they could increase in value. The Fed instead decided to take those C.D.O.’s onto its own books and pay the banks to extinguish the contracts.
662 2010-01-23 In his dissent to the 5-to-4 ruling, Justice John Paul Stevens highlighted the burden placed on states.

“The court operates with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of Congress’s most significant efforts to regulate the role that corporations and unions play in electoral politics,” he wrote. “It compounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well.”

For now, the decision does not overturn all the state laws in question, but it is only a matter of time, experts said, before the laws will be challenged in the courts or repealed by state legislatures. Since the state laws are vulnerable, it is unlikely that officials will continue enforcing them, experts said.

Montana is one of the states that will probably be affected. It has one of the nation’s oldest campaign finance laws, approved by voters in 1912 after a copper baron, William A. Clark of Butte, bribed members of the State Legislature to get a United States Senate seat.

Chris Gallus, a former lobbyist and a lawyer who represents business interests in Montana, said his clients would most likely challenge the statute if it were not stricken.

States that can expect to see the biggest and most sudden influx of money are those — like Ohio and Florida — where it is relatively expensive to run campaigns and where races are competitive, said Ray La Raja, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He predicted corporate spending would increase in states where control of state governments hangs in the balance.

The ruling left many state lawmakers frustrated and uncertain how to proceed.

“It’s absolutely outrageous and we’ve got to find a way to deal with it,” said Michael E. Gronstal, the Senate majority leader in Iowa, where lawmakers were exploring how they might keep at least some of the restrictions on political expenditures in the current state law.

The decision could also affect pending trials, like that of Mr. DeLay, who was charged in 2005 with criminal violations of state campaign finance laws and money laundering.

“The money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering charges will definitely be undermined,” said Dick DeGuerin, Mr. DeLay’s lawyer. “The reason is that the foundation of the prosecution’s argument is that corporate donations are illegal in any part of the political process, but the Supreme Court just struck that idea down.”

But Carl Bryan Case, the director of the Appellate Division at the Travis County District Attorney’s Office, which is handling Mr. DeLay’s case, disagreed.

“The indictments against Mr. DeLay describe corporate contributions to a political campaign,” he said. “What the Supreme Court addressed was independent expenditures made by third parties on their own and without having to do with campaigns.”

Alan Schneider, the state prosecutor in Grand Traverse County, Mich., said he was concerned about his continuing criminal investigation of Meijer Inc.’s actions in a 2007 recall election. “We’re going to have to shift our focus entirely,” he said.

The court’s decision effectively overturns the section of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act that prohibits corporate financing of candidate campaigns, Mr. Schneider said. Meijer is accused of illegally funneling tens of thousands of dollars to groups to try to depose the township board in Acme Township in a 2007 recall election.

“Unfortunately, we now have to drop the felony charges we were pursuing and only go after the misdemeanors,” he said. “It’s frustrating.”

David Primo, a political science professor at the University of Rochester, counseled caution about predicting the impact of the Supreme Court decision. While it grants corporations and unions new access, it is also likely to spur state officials and campaign reform groups to push for new types of restrictions.

“This tug of war will continue as long as we have fundamental disagreements in the country over the role of money in politics,” he said.

The decision may galvanize reformers to push harder for public financing of elections.

It will also bring new pressure on states to improve their disclosure rules, experts said, since those rules will be one of the only ways left to regulate how corporations and other groups make expenditures in local races.

Joseph Birkenstock, the former chief counsel for the Democratic National Committee now with the law firm Caplin & Drysdale in Washington, said states that previously banned corporate expenditures would begin adapting disclosure rules so that the public can get the same information about corporate political advertisements that is currently available for advertisements paid for by individuals or political action committees.

Richard Hasen, an election law specialist at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said he expected state judicial races to be especially affected by the Supreme Court decision.

In recent years, he said, the states where corporate contributions were permitted saw an explosion in spending in judicial races. With the new ruling, those states and others where such donations were limited or banned are likely to see more money spent on these races.

Between 2000 and 2009, spending on state supreme court races across 22 states that had competitive elections was about $207 million, up from $86 million between 1990 and 2000, according Justice at Stake, at watchdog group that monitors money in court races.
663 2010-01-23 ”With demand far exceeding supply at the moment, air freight costs have increased dramatically,” Gregory Barrow, a spokesman for the World Food Program in Rome, said in an e-mail message.

A senior British relief official, speaking on his government’s standard condition of anonymity, said air freight costs from Europe to Haiti had increased by 10 percent to 30 percent since the quake.

Relief group officials declined to name specific operators or brokers, to avoid endangering future business.

An official at a large air charter company said rates invariably rose when demand increased, whether the cause was a disaster or the increased air shipments that precede the Christmas shopping season. She requested anonymity because the company had a United Nations contract.

Peter Nopper, the chief executive of Tri-Med of Britain, a relief equipment broker, said he was quoted a price of $520,000 for a large plane to fly relief supplies from Dubai to Haiti.

“There seems to be some speculation going on,” Mr. Nopper said. “I think that people are throwing out high prices to see if anyone will bite.”

He said that the fees some cargo operators were asking for Haiti flights might reflect the fact that planes were returning empty, rather than with return loads that could help defray costs.

“Because they have to do it so fast they are charging for a round trip,” he said.

Not all companies appear to have raised their rates: Oxfam said it noticed no large increase when it chartered a cargo plane to the Dominican Republic from England to deliver water, sanitation equipment and tents, after its warehouse in Haiti collapsed. But others say they cannot find planes to fly to Haiti at any price.

Along with the United States, some companies and countries are moving to help get supplies in. British Airways made a cargo plane available; the United States, the United Nations and Britain have also begun using smaller vessels that can dock in shallower ports.

In coming weeks, the need for air cargo flights will only intensify as relief organizations exhaust their inventories of relief supplies. Those groups will be turning to equipment brokers or will buy supplies directly from manufacturers in places like India, Pakistan and China that produce emergency equipment like tents, blankets, and kitchen utensils.

The Port-au-Prince seaport has been too damaged to accommodate large ships carrying relief supplies like tents, blankets and cooking equipment.

With only one runway operating at the main Port-au-Prince airport, many relief flights are landing in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, and the supplies are then trucked in over sometimes difficult roads.

“What is unusual about Haiti is that it is a big disaster in a small country,” said the senior British relief official. “Usually we are talking about medium to large countries where an earthquake will do a lot of damage but it won’t bring down everything.”
664 2010-01-23 There have been many superlative dancers who have been far from their own best choreographers. (Rudolf Nureyev surely tops the list.)

Foofwa d’Imobilité is among them, and to watch his current show at Dance New Amsterdam — I attended on Thursday night — is a peculiarly divided and frustrating experience. On his last New York visit, in 2008, he certainly showcased aspects of his disarming and sometimes phenomenal skill as a dancer. They are still in evidence today, and yet both halves of the evening were dismally tedious.

The program, “Foofwa d’Imobilité/Neopost Ahrrrt,” begins with “Musings re Merce John and Bob.” In the 1990s Mr. d’Imobilité danced in Merce Cunningham’s company; here he pays tribute to Cunningham, John Cage and “Bob,” better known as Robert Rauschenberg.

Those three artists pioneered a form of dance theater in which dance, music and design existed independently of one another; the cutely precious idea here is that Mr. d’Imobilité is bringing them all together, actually embodying them. His body is painted and decorated in bright layerings that evoke the Rauschenberg décor for “Minutiae”; he parrots sounds and speeches from both Cage and Cunningham; and he quotes innumerable passages of Cunningham choreography.

This ought to prove considerably more interesting than Mr. d’Imobilité makes it. He even quotes dances that only Mr. Cunningham performed during his lifetime (most obviously, the 1975 “Solo,” known as “the animal solo,” in which Cunningham isolated and coordinated body parts — neck, lower leg, arm and others — to suggest one animal species morphing into another).

You’re never in doubt of his prowess, of his ardor as an executant, of his animal grace, of his marvelous naturalness. The tribute, however, feels adolescent and superficial. Mainly, it seems as if Mr. d’Imobilité were brilliantly illustrating someone else’s intellectually elaborate but artistically trivial theory; at times it’s even as if you were observing a supremely gifted but silly teenager mimicking his teachers once their backs are turned. The exercise never once turns into serious theater.
665 2010-01-23 The mini-museum’s artifacts, some of them never exhibited before, will be drawn from the historical society’s vast collections, said Valerie Paley, the society’s historian for special projects. Aimed at roughly a fourth-grade level, the information in the exhibits will nevertheless be intended to appeal to all ages, she said, adding that educators helped select a diverse group of historical figures to illuminate different aspects of history.

A pavilion about newsboys and newsgirls, some as young as 7 when they hawked newspapers for pennies in the early part of the 20th century, will also contain documents showing the extent of the child-labor problem at the time.

Information about the “orphan trains” that took thousands of destitute children from New York to families in rural and farm communities across the country will be accompanied by a huge archive from the Children’s Aid Society: journal entries from social workers, children’s artwork, photographs and letters. Children will also be able to sit next to a cutout of a composite orphan on a three-dimensional train, listen to train noises and see a map of places along the routes.

Most of the exhibits will focus on individuals, like the young Hamilton or Esteban Bellán, who came to New York from Cuba at about 13 and was the first Latin American baseball player in a major league, about 1870. A “talking” portrait of a young Cornelia van Varick, daughter of a 17th-century female textile merchant, is meant to show what life was like for a girl of about 10 in 1700.

There is also the story of Dr. James McCune Smith, a little-known but influential New York native who in the 1830s was the first black university-trained physician in the country. His exhibit will include rare documents showing how he learned math and spelling at the African Free School, an institution for black New Yorkers.

Smith, forced by discrimination to receive his medical training in Scotland, established a practice and a pharmacy in lower Manhattan; was an abolitionist who founded an orphanage for black children; and wrote widely about many topics.

Though the number of children’s museums around the country has grown tremendously in recent decades — there were 243 of them in 2007, with another 78 in the planning stages, according to one study, compared with 38 in 1975 — the DiMenna museum will be one of very few history museums for children. Since becoming president in 2004, Ms. Mirrer has sought a new prominence for the historical society, and the children’s museum is part of that effort.

The “Slavery in New York” exhibition, which began in 2005, broke attendance records for the society, which opened in 1804. Total attendance has risen 156 percent since Ms. Mirrer’s tenure began, according to society figures, with attendance by school groups up 429 percent.

The DiMenna museum will also have interactive features like touch screens, a place where children can videotape their own histories, and a “historical facebook” about contemporaries of the historical figures. Visitors will be able to use maps and other documents to solve historical mysteries and to see toys from other periods. Most elements of the exhibitions will be permanent.

“The unifying architectural design is that you’ll feel like you’re inside a cabinet of curiosities,” said Lee Skolnick, who has designed about 50 children’s museums around the country. “Names and dates and old etchings are not the way you reach kids. Kids are sophisticated, so we don’t do greeting cards. These are intense places with a lot of exciting information.”

Children 12 and under will continue to receive free admission to the society and will have free admission to the new museum.
666 2010-01-23 BEIJING — The Chinese government made its first official comments on Thursday about a prominent human rights advocate who disappeared nearly a year ago, but its remarks left his fate shrouded in mystery.

At a regular news conference on Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman answered a question about the advocate, Gao Zhisheng, saying that he “is where he should be.”

That the spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, even acknowledged the question was widely interpreted as an indication that Mr. Gao was alive and in captivity. But the remarks’ disturbing overtones left open questions about his physical and mental state.

Fears for Mr. Gao — a combative lawyer who defended Falun Gong spiritual practitioners and published an account of being tortured by state authorities — peaked last week when his brother told The Associated Press that he had tracked down a Beijing policeman who detained Mr. Gao last February, and that the officer said Mr. Gao had gone “missing” in September.

The Chinese government had until Thursday declined to acknowledge that Mr. Gao had been detained or that anything out of the ordinary had happened to him.
667 2010-01-23 The Florida lawsuit, known as a John Doe summons, was dropped after the August agreement was reached. However, if more lawsuits are filed trying to block the disclosure of the 4,450 names, it might be revived, according to a United States government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.

The Swiss court’s ruling “has the potential to unravel the settlement between the United States, the I.R.S., and the Swiss government over the John Doe summons,” said Scott D. Michel, a tax lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale, in Washington. “It would not surprise me if the I.R.S. and the Justice Department now try to figure out some way to reopen that case and pursue more stringent enforcement.”

Switzerland has until mid-August to turn over the 4,450 names, so any revival of the lawsuit would not come before then, the United States official said.

Should the suit be revived, it could also jeopardize a separate deal last February in which UBS averted indictment by agreeing to pay $780 million the United States government and admitting criminal wrongdoing in the offshore private banking services it sold to wealthy Americans. The deal was a watershed in Swiss private banking because it was the first time a Swiss bank had been forced to reveal details about its clientele.

UBS, a bulwark of the Swiss economy and in global financial circles, had fiercely resisted any disclosure, arguing that doing so would cause it to violate Swiss confidentiality laws.

Justice Department officials had said on the eve of the agreement in August that they would consider indicting the bank under the terms of a deferred-prosecution agreement included in the February settlement if a judge ultimately ordered UBS to turn over the 52,000 client names and the bank refused to do so.

Swiss law distinguishes between tax evasion — the nonreporting of income, including failure to file W-9 disclosures of offshore accounts with the I.R.S. — and tax fraud, which is defined as the use of corporate structures to hide money and ill-gotten gains. While Swiss law does not consider tax evasion to be a crime, the August 2009 deal between the United States and Switzerland included a murky reference to “tax fraud and the like” in which Switzerland appeared to agree that tax evasion was a crime.

But in its ruling regarding the August agreement, the Swiss judges wrote that “provided the taxpayer did nothing more than not declare income, an account or return the form W-9, consequently committing tax evasion under Swiss law, he hasn’t acted fraudulently.” The ruling also said that only the identities of clients whose UBS accounts were held through secret corporate structures and trusts, instead of their own names, could be disclosed.

It is unclear how many of the 4,450 names involve such structures.

In a statement, the I.R.S. said Friday that “We have every expectation that the Swiss government will continue to honor the terms of the agreement.”

In a statement Friday, UBS said it had “taken notice of the Swiss Federal Administrative Court’s decision.” The Swiss government announced that it would assess the situation to determine “how the implementation of the agreement between Switzerland and the United States can be ensured.”

Friday’s ruling is the second by a Swiss court to challenge the disclosure of client names. On Thursday, Swiss regulators said they would appeal a separate ruling by a Swiss court that said the Swiss regulators broke secrecy laws when they authorized UBS to hand over the names of 255 clients as part of the $780 million deal last February.

The Swiss regulatory agency, Finma, said Thursday that it handed over the names because the possibility of an indictment of UBS “would have threatened its existence.”
668 2010-01-23 TOKYO — Few Americans have ever heard of Yoshikazu Shimabukuro or Susumu Inamine, or even the tiny Okinawan city of Nago, where the two men are candidates in a heated race for mayor.

But this seemingly minor election could, in an indirect way, have major consequences for the United States’ ties with Japan, Washington’s most important Asian ally. Depending on the outcome, political experts say, the vote on Sunday could widen a diplomatic rift with Japan, and possibly even add to pressure to reduce the 50,000 American military personnel stationed in the country.

Nago is where the United States and Japan agreed four years ago to relocate a busy Marine helicopter base in a controversial deal that took a decade to complete — largely because it was so hard to find a community that was willing to accept the Americans.

Now Nago, a city of 60,000, may be about to reconsider its acceptance of the base, with its runways built on landfill in pristine turquoise waters near Henoko, a sleepy fishing village administered by Nago. The question of whether to reject the 2006 deal has emerged as the dominant issue in Sunday’s vote, which pits the pro-base incumbent, Mr. Shimabukuro, 63, against Mr. Inamine, 64, the chairman of the city’s education board, who opposes the base.

In Tokyo, the election is being closely watched as a crucial referendum on the 2006 deal that could sway the new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, who has yet to state clearly whether he supports or opposes the plan. Mr. Hatoyama has raised the ire of the Obama administration by putting off the relocation issue until May, when he will decide whether to support it or name a new site for the base.
669 2010-01-23 “It can cost $3.2 million to take care of an autistic person over the course of his or her lifetime,” the study said.

More families are grappling with the disorder than ever before. One of every 110 8-year-old children in the United States has been diagnosed with autism — and one of every 70 boys, according to the latest survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released last fall. That is up from one in 150 children in a comparable report released in 2007.

“The numbers are just amazing,” said Pat Kemp, executive vice president of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, “Unless we attack this like a national health crisis, we’re going to have a huge economic crisis on our hands.”

Certainly families feel the financial strain. Many health insurance policies do not cover autism treatments, while those that do often have severe limits. And there is very little government or private financial assistance available.

In many cases these children will need assistance all their lives, Mr. Ganz points out. Making sure there is money for the future is something else parents worry about.

When his sons received their diagnosis, Mr. Sell was practicing personal-injury law in Texas, and he began paying for many of their treatments from his own income and savings. In 2005, as he became more involved in autism issues, he joined the staff of the Autism Society of America in Bethesda, Md., where he is now a vice president.

His sons are now 15. One, Joe, is talkative and considered “high functioning.” The other, Ben, is nonverbal with profound autism.

“What works for one child doesn’t necessarily work for the other,” Mr. Sell said. “So we’re talking about finding and paying for twice as many treatments.”

In the early years, the Sell family had some autism coverage under Mr. Sell’s health insurance. But claims for certain therapies, tests and treatments were often denied. “I was very aggressive about appealing those denials, and I often won,” Mr. Sell said.

But even with coverage, Mr. Sell found he needed to pay enormous amounts out of pocket to come close to giving his sons the 20 to 40 hours of behavioral therapies each week that were often recommended. (Eventually, as discussed below, Mr. Sell was also able to obtain financial assistance through a special part of the Medicaid program.)

Although direct financial support may be scarce and hard to obtain, there are several autism information and advocacy groups that routinely help parents navigate financial hurdles. Here is a road map parents can use to get started.

CHECK YOUR INSURANCE Coverage for autism treatments is still far from common, but it is improving. Some large employers offer policies that cover treatment, and 15 states have passed laws mandating at least some autism-related coverage. The Autism Society’s Web site lists the relevant states. (That section of the site is still under construction, but you can scroll down to see the states.)

In addition, Maine and New Hampshire both have legislation pending that could pass soon, Mr. Kemp said.

If you do have coverage, watch for limitations. Because treatment for autism is so individualized, there are few uniform standards or protocols for insurance companies to follow. That means parents often have to argue that a certain therapy or treatment is necessary. Also, be sure to check any caps on treatment, Mr. Sell warns. What may look generous — say $36,000 a year — can be spent quickly. Or there may be limits on how many sessions of a particular type of therapy will be paid for each year.

And you will want to coordinate your insurance coverage with the services you may be receiving from your child’s school. If an occupational therapist sees your child regularly in school, for example, you may want to save your insurance dollars for social interaction therapies.

In addition, you may need to be especially aggressive about coverage for some medical conditions. Gastrointestinal problems, for instance, are extremely common in autistic children.

Mr. Sell found himself fighting for such coverage for Ben, his nonverbal son. The insurance company had denied the claim for gastrointestinal testing, saying that because Ben’s behavior problems were related to autism, the testing was not covered.

Mr. Sell, convinced Ben was in pain and could not tell anyone what was wrong, appealed and won. The tests showed that Ben had ulcers and lower-intestine problems that still occasionally flare up and require treatment.

MEDICAID WAIVERS Some states offer Medicaid coverage for children with autism without taking the family’s income into account — only the child’s diagnosis. This is usually reserved for fairly serious cases but is worth exploring, Mr. Sell said.

“This was a godsend for us,” he said. The waiver, he said, allows families access to services that private insurance won’t cover and that they wouldn’t be able to afford otherwise.

With the waiver, Mr. Sell was able to get more home-based speech and occupational therapies for his sons to supplement the sessions they receive at the public school they both attend. Medicaid also covers recreational therapy during which a specialist takes Ben and Joe on hikes and other outings, giving the parents some downtime.

To see if your child is eligible for a Medicaid waiver, go to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Web site and click on your state.

Because Medicaid is one of the few government lifelines available, waiting lists for waivers can be extremely long. Mr. Sell, for example, waited nine years to get waivers for his sons.

“Just go ahead and get on the list and try not to be too discouraged,” advised Mr. Sell. “Many states are moving faster now.”

GO LOCAL Many autism advocacy organizations, including Autism Speaks and the Autism Society of America, are affiliated with local chapters throughout the country. In addition, most states, counties, towns and cities provide lists of local autism resources and support groups.

It is people in the local groups who will know all the resources available. They can also help you keep up with the latest research, so you don’t spend time and money chasing the many unsubstantiated “cures” out there. They will also have lots of practical advice, like which dentists, optometrists and even barbers are good with autistic children.

“You think going to the barber is no big deal?” Mr. Sell asked. “Just try it with an autistic child.”

OTHER RESOURCES A handful of organizations like Easter Seals and the National Autism Association offer financial help to struggling families. Autism Family Resources and United Healthcare Children’s Foundation also offer grants to pay for autism treatments.
670 2010-01-23 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 216.90 points, or 2.09 percent, to 10,172.98. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 24.72 points, or 2.21 percent, to 1,091.76, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 60.41 points, or 2.67 percent, to 2,205.29. For the week, the Dow was down about 4.1 percent and at levels last seen in early November.

Analyst said the next few weeks might be crucial. Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, said the market could be headed for a significant pullback if economic data did not surpass expectations. “The consensus is that if we’re going to stay at the levels we’re at, the news has to be extraordinary,” Mr. Cass said. “The data can’t be middling, it can’t be ambiguous, it has to be positive.”

As they did on Thursday, financial shares led the decline. Shares of Morgan Stanley declined 5.2 percent; Goldman Sachs fell 4.2 percent; Bank of America dropped 3.7 percent; and Citigroup, less than 1 percent. In Europe, Barclays lost 6 percent. UBS of Switzerland was off 5.1 percent, while Santander of Spain gave up 3 percent.

Other analysts saw President Obama’s announcement of tighter banking rules as a sign that government leaders were looking beyond the financial crisis.

“It’s clear that politicians are starting to have enough confidence that the global economy has been saved and are starting to try to find ways of paying the bills,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said Friday in a research note. “The risk is that they do this too early, and the timing of this announcement is unfortunate given it coincides with the escalation of problems in peripheral Europe and in a week where China has effectively tightened policy.”

The comment about peripheral Europe was a reference to the budgetary problems in Greece that have rattled bond markets.

The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 98 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.61 percent from 3.59 percent late Thursday.

Earnings from two companies helped to offset some of the declines. General Electric topped expectations despite a 19 percent drop in fourth-quarter income. For the quarter, G.E. posted net income of $2.94 billion.

And the fast-food restaurant chain McDonald’s said fourth-quarter profit was $1.22 billion, up from $985.3 million a year earlier. The company said sales overseas had helped to offset a weakness in American sales.

G.E. shares rose 9 cents, to $16.11, and McDonald’s rose 19 cents, to $63.39.

Markets in Europe were also lower. In London, the FTSE 100 was down 32.11 points, or 0.6 percent, and the DAX shed 51.65 points, or 0.9 percent, in Frankfurt.

In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index, Japan’s leading market gauge, led the region’s declines with a drop of 2.56 percent. The Shanghai composite index in mainland China fell nearly 1 percent, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropped 0.6 percent, with the international banks Standard Chartered and HSBC both down.

Juan Manuel Lopez (28-0, 25 knockouts) won the World Boxing Organization featherweight title by knocking out Steven Luevano with a right hook 44 seconds into the seventh round. Also at the Garden, John Duddy (28-1) knocked out Juan Astorga (14-4-1) just 1:55 into their middleweight fight.
677 2010-01-24 A few students have gone on to Morton College, which has a two-year program, and to four-year colleges, school officials said. They said graduates often got good jobs because they improved their social skills and learned to present themselves favorably.

Experts in school violence say it is unusual to have an extensive psychotherapy program in a school. “It is a very exciting program that has helped many students turn their lives around,” said Dr. David Terman, director of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, which oversees the program with the school.

R. (initials are being used to protect the students’ privacy), an 18-year-old senior, was admitted to Morton Alternative his sophomore year after being expelled for writing gang graffiti in school. “Art can get you in trouble,” he said with a grin.

R. said he was in a gang, but left when a relative died because of gang violence. He said the counselors taught him to talk through his problems so he could decide, for example, that he did not need to fight to resolve an issue. He said he wanted to be a science teacher, and he helps teach a class, as do other students who excel in the program.

Dr. Smaller said he was originally reluctant to visit the school when David Myles, a social worker, invited him to attend a group counseling session six years ago. “To my dismay, I have been coming back ever since,” he said with a smile.

Mr. Myles said: “You get hooked. There is so much potential for these students and how much you could do with them.”

After two years, Dr. Smaller decided that students could be helped by more frequent psychotherapy sessions. He persuaded a private foundation and the American Psychoanalytic Foundation to provide money to hire him as the in-school psychoanalyst, as well as to bring on three part-time social workers.

“We needed to see what was going on inside these kids,” Dr. Smaller said, “not just their stupid behavior.”

The Morton program has won favorable notice in academic circles. Dr. Carla Solomon, director of the Peter Blos Center for Adolescents, which supports the George Jackson Academy in Manhattan, has asked Dr. Smaller to help develop a replica of his Morton Alternative program at the school for underprivileged boys. “I think his work very much needs to be done in a widespread way,” she said.

Dr. Smaller is also starting a pilot program in Saugatuck, Mich.

Stuart Twemlow, a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and an expert on school bullying, said troubled students “need someone like Mark to have faith in them. If he can replicate the Cicero project in Michigan and New York City and train people in other schools to do this well, it will be dramatically effective,” he said.

Dr. Smaller said the Cicero program owes much of its success to Rudy Hernandez, the principal of Morton Alternative. “He has an intuitive sense of what the kids needed, a responsiveness to whatever was going on internally,” Dr. Smaller said.

On Wednesdays, Mr. Hernandez meets with teachers, social workers and Dr. Smaller to discuss the students they are most concerned about. Recently, the focus was on girls who had been involved in shoving matches that had escalated into a fistfight.

“We explained we would not tolerate their behavior and would help them have more self-control,” said Sara Monner, a school counselor. Parents were invited to meetings at the school to help deal with the behavior.

Gangs are pervasive in the neighborhood and in the schools. One student, J., was transferred to Morton Alternative in his sophomore year after he was caught selling marijuana. At one time he lived on the border between rival gangs, and he said that when he was 9, he was shot at when he tried to “tag” a garage in a rival gang’s territory.

In a group therapy session, J. talked about his desire to turn his life around. “My parents wanted to teach me things, and I wasn’t around for it,” he said. “Now I want to learn what they wanted me to become.”

Even with the school’s efforts, students still struggle. In March 2008, J.’s girlfriend gave birth to twin boys. A month later, he was charged in connection with an incident in which one son’s leg was broken; J. had pulled the child out of a car seat without removing one of the restraining straps. J. said it was an accident, and an orthopedic surgeon submitted a statement to a court that the child’s injury could have been unintentional. His case has not yet been resolved.

Despite his problems, J. graduated from the Morton Alternative High School last June.

“I never thought that because of this school I would one day walk in the right direction,” he said. “I don’t want my sons to need anything, just as my father wanted for us when he left Mexico.”

Matt Landa, a social worker who often conducts home visits to help his students, said, “Nobody here has a ‘Little House on the Prairie’ background.”

Sometimes, he said, the parents are involved with drugs or gangs or are in jail. What goes on outside strongly affects the students’ ability to focus on school and develop academically.

“But they are amazing to work with,” he added, “when I don’t feel like pulling out my hair.”
678 2010-01-24 In “The Pragmatic Leviathan” (column, Jan. 19), David Brooks suggests that a limited federal government is compatible with Americans’ expectations of government services.

The sacrosanct benefits that Americans now enjoy — for example, Medicare and Social Security payments at a retirement age well below life expectancy and tax subsidies for private health insurance and home ownership — cannot be delivered by a government with limited regulatory and fiscal authority.

The paradox that conservatives wish to ignore — that Americans expect both substantial government services and low tax rates — will become increasingly evident as our work force (and, consequently, income tax base) shrinks as a result of retirements and gains in workplace efficiency.

Perhaps our pragmatic president is suffering in the polls because he has succeeded in making Americans uncomfortably aware of just how much money their government has to spend to subsidize the cherished “middle-class” American life.
679 2010-01-24 There are now 16 “intelligence” agencies communicating in one direction: vertically. There seems to be little lateral interagency sharing of information.

If we must maintain all 16, there should be one central database pooling every piece of information received for analysis by one group of highly trained specialists — with some of them speaking Arabic.

Re “Meet Mikey, 8: U.S. Has Him on Watch List” (front page, Jan. 14):

While it is disturbing that, even when he was 2 years old, Mikey Hicks was getting frisked by Transportation Security Administration personnel, far more disturbing is the fact that the T.S.A. personnel, who are supposedly the front line defense against airline terrorism, do not have either the sense or the administrative freedom to make a judgment call and say: This little boy is not a threat.

Until they are able to make an informed decision based on a passenger’s behavior, age or appearance, we won’t be safe. They will be too busy abiding by rules that often make no sense to look for the real threats.

The writer is a professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University.

The story of Mikey Hicks is but the latest frustrating example of how pointless and illogical Transportation Security Administration screening can be.

But the real news in the article concerns the story of a Canadian executive, Mario Labbé, who, fed up with aggressive T.S.A. questioning and frequent delays whenever he flew to the United States, changed his name in 2008 to François Mario Labbé and is now no longer recognized by T.S.A.’s computers.

The article adds, “Some travelers purposely misspell their own names when buying tickets, apparently enough to fool the system.”

Of what use is this system if the people flagged by it — including, presumably, terrorists — can simply change or misspell their names to avoid T.S.A. scrutiny?

Far from having “more fervor than skill,” someone in the terrorists’ hierarchy had enough skill to ensure that their designated terrorist spread terror — and that the “riveting message for Americans: Be afraid” was widely and frequently broadcast.

I do not think that the Qaeda sponsors of the accused underwear bomber cared how incompetent he was. All he needed to do to accomplish their goal was to make at least an attempt to set off a bomb to ensure a large amount of publicity. Their goal — part of a program to wear us down, mentally and financially — was simply to panic us enough to get us spending more and more time and money on ever greater security measures at home and military ventures abroad.

At this they have certainly succeeded. As recent history shows, creating chaos and expense for us at home advances the cause of Al Qaeda as much as or more than any military success it might have on its home ground.

Underwear bombs are another of the simple and inexpensive devices (box-cutters and improvised explosive devices among them) through which Muslim extremists are waging, and maybe winning, their war against us “infidels.”

I believe that you are absolutely right about recent Al Qaeda plots against Americans when you say that “rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut” they are “a scattered, uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill.”

The failed Christmas bombing is a prime example. Agreed, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab should have never been allowed on board the Detroit-bound jet. Yet his mission fizzled, almost literally.

Why? Because he lacked the right detonator. And, if he had had a cumbersome metal detonator on his person, security personnel and the most primitive scanning device would have caught it.

The hysteria resulting from this incident has only made flying more difficult.
680 2010-01-24 In the special election held last Tuesday, though, Mr. Kurker eagerly cast his ballot for Scott Brown, a previously little-known Republican state senator, contributing to one of the biggest upsets in state history. “I wish I could have voted more than once,” Mr. Kurker said.

The Town of Barnstable, made up of seven villages, the largest of which is Hyannis, voted 12,331 to 7,543 in favor of Mr. Brown. The precinct that encompassed the Kennedy family’s Hyannis Port compound, and where Mr. Kennedy himself used to cast his vote, also rejected the Democrat, Martha Coakley, the state attorney general who had been considered a prohibitive favorite.

The outcome gives Republicans 41 votes in the Senate, just enough to potentially scuttle the health care legislation that Mr. Kennedy worked so vigorously to pass. And it has provoked conflicting emotions in the town that is home to gray-shingled summer residences, asphalt-lined stretches of strip malls and a year-round population of about 50,000.

“Even down here where he was admired and considered a friend, people, when they went to vote, were just thinking about their own fears and concerns,” said Patrick Princi, 36, the chairman of the Barnstable Democratic Town Committee.

Most of those concerns have nothing to with the previous occupant of the seat.

“It wasn’t about the Kennedy seat,” said Deborah Converse, 63, president and chief executive of the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, which oversees the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum. “I think the Democrats wanted to make it that way, but it just wasn’t,” said Ms. Converse, who voted for Ms. Coakley. “I didn’t think of Kennedy at all, and I run this museum.”

Local issues, like a controversial plan to allow a wind farm six miles off the coast — which Mr. Brown and Mr. Kennedy opposed, but Ms. Coakley supported — played a role, as did national issues like health care, taxes and the economy.

Even those who voted for Ms. Coakley said they found her campaign uninspired, and noted that her glad-handing skills paled in comparison with the famously gregarious Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Brown campaigned more aggressively in the area and was careful to praise Mr. Kennedy, calling him irreplaceable during his victory speech.

The results mirrored those of much of Cape Cod, in which 11 of the 15 towns backed the Republican. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in Barnstable, but both are dwarfed by independent voters.

“I just think everyone is sick of the way everything’s going,” said Doug Brown, 39, who owns a small excavation company, is not related to Tuesday’s winner and who used to regularly end up with Mr. Kennedy’s runaway dogs in his yard. “The Kennedy thing is done now.”

The voters of Cape Cod pride themselves on being independent and have historically been more conservative than the rest of the state. Hyannis, where John F. Kennedy gave his victory speech after winning the presidency in 1960, and where a memorial and a museum to him now stand, voted against him that year.

And when Edward Kennedy first ran for the Senate in 1962, he lost here by more than two to one, according to the Barnstable town clerk, Linda E. Hutchenrider. Even in later years, as his reputation as a legislator who took care of voters back home grew large, he bested one opponent by fewer than 800 votes and only twice won 60 percent of the vote.

For Democrats, the days since the election have been rife with second-guessing. Some lamented that other members of the Kennedy clan — one of the late senator’s sons and a nephew were mentioned as possible contenders, as was his widow, Victoria — had not jumped into the race.

“I would have loved to have had Victoria run, but she had to make her own decision,” said Howard K. Penn, 78, co-owner of the Puritan Cape Cod clothing store, where generations of Kennedys have bought khaki pants and polo shirts.

Philip W. Johnston, a public relations consultant and friend of the Kennedys, said one member of the family, whom he declined to name, had told him that they were particularly pained by the loss of the filibuster-proof Democratic supermajority. “The notion that health reform might die because Teddy died,” he said, “is very hard to deal with.”
681 2010-01-24 Instead, experts say, if the measures pass it will be because Oregon lawmakers found a way to narrowly focus a tax increase that more liberal parts of the state could tolerate, even at a time when a tax increase could not be harder to digest.

What happens here may be closely watched elsewhere. While tax increases are probably coming in plenty of other states, most by executive or legislative action, Oregon will be the first this year to ask voters to raise taxes on themselves — or at least on some of themselves.

“What’s the saying? ‘Don’t tax me. Don’t tax thee. Tax the man behind the tree?’ ” said Tim Hibbitts, a longtime independent pollster in Oregon. “The measures were designed and have been sold with the idea that somebody else is going to pay, people who are high-income earners and businesses.”

Supporters, led by teachers and public employees’ unions, point out that the income tax increase affects less than 3 percent of the population: individuals who earn more than $125,000 a year. They say the state’s wealthier residents should pay more to help those with less. They also say that state businesses enjoy a relatively low tax burden and that most small businesses will pay only $140 more in fees.

Opponents say the proposals are the wrong fix at the wrong time. State income taxes for wealthier Oregon residents are already among the highest of any state. But the most notable opposition may have come from powerful business groups and prominent executives like Phil Knight of Nike, which is based near Portland.

Oregon unemployment is at 11 percent and new taxes will make it even harder to hire, opponents say. They say that supporters are underestimating how many people would be affected, and that while some of the increases are scheduled to fade out, some are not.

Complicating matters further, the Legislature has essentially already spent the $727 million in projected revenue by incorporating the anticipated tax increases into the current budget. If the measures fail, lawmakers will have to make new cuts or find another way to raise revenue.

What many people on each side agree on is that, recession or not, Oregon’s tax system is flawed and that passing Measures 66 and 67 is not a long-term solution.

Oregon is one of only five states with no state sales tax, and voters have repeatedly rejected ballot initiatives to create one. In addition, a statewide cap on property taxes limits how much local governments can raise rates each year.

Here in heavily forested Jackson County and in several others, there is another wrinkle. Property taxes were historically low here in part because the counties received payments from the federal government for timber production on federal lands. Yet timber production has declined substantially, and subsequent federal subsidies have not compensated for the decline. That aid, too, is set to phase out.

John W. Tapogna, a former economist with the Congressional Budget Office who now leads an economics consulting firm in the Pacific Northwest, said the situation facing counties in this part of Oregon could soon become a crisis that might help force the state to look more broadly at its tax structure.

If that happens, Mr. Tapogna is among many people who believe that the first order of business should be to do away with Oregon’s so-called kicker law, a unique instrument among states and one that underscores Oregon’s distaste for taxes.

When times are good, the state sends kicker refunds to residents from revenue that exceeds forecasts by state economists. In December 2007, just as the country was entering the recession, Oregon returned $1.1 billion to residents, bounty from the previous boom year, because of the kicker law. By the spring of 2009, as Oregon’s unemployment rate was on its way to becoming one of the highest in the nation, the Legislature was voting to raise taxes by $727 million, the increase now before voters.

“On the one hand, we are handing big checks back, and then we’re saying we don’t have enough to pay for services,” Mr. Tapogna said. “It’s an absurd process.” In 2007, the checks averaged about $600 per taxpayer, substantially more than previous kickers had averaged.

He added, “The point is, regardless of what happens on Jan. 26, the system is broken, and there’s an awful lot of work left to do.”

Charles Sheketoff, executive director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy, which advocates for lower-income people and helped shape the tax proposals, said he also wanted to do away with the kicker and build a rainy day fund. But he said the state also needed to close more of what he called corporate tax loopholes.

Asked about the wisdom of raising taxes in a recession, Mr. Sheketoff pointed to a widely circulated paper co-written several years ago by Peter R. Orszag, now the White House budget director, that said focused tax increases on higher-income earners do less overall economic damage than steep spending cuts.

While the measures on the ballot Tuesday are not long-term solutions, Mr. Sheketoff said, they are a “first, important and necessary step.”

“It only asks a little bit more from the fortunate few who did well during the last upturn and are still doing well today,” he said. “If you’re going to raise taxes, do what’s fair and equitable and right.”
682 2010-01-24 It has already been a long season for the Gophers, who set goals of competing for a Big Ten title and making a run in the N.C.A.A. tournament before the season began. But the pursuit of those goals has been hampered from the outset.

Two new players who were expected to be big contributors — White and the transfer Trevor Mbakwe — have not played a minute because of legal issues.

White pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and theft for stealing clothes and shoving a mall security guard late last year. Shortly after, the campus police started investigating whether he had a role in the suspected theft of a laptop from the student’s dormitory room.

White resumed practicing with the team last week.

White’s lawyer, F. Clayton Tyler, said he and White were relieved that he was not facing more serious theft charges, but Tyler found the trespass charges “strange.”

Tyler added, “I’ve never seen an alleged theft charged in this manner.”

He said on the night in question, White was socializing in the dorm but did not take the computer.

White is scheduled for a Feb. 1 appearance in Minneapolis municipal court. Tyler said he had not had a chance to closely examine the charges, and he left open the possibility that White might be willing to strike some sort of plea deal.

Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal said White was charged with trespassing rather than theft “based on the evidence that is provable in court beyond a reasonable route.”

Athletic Director Joel Maturi said the charges did not affect White’s status with the university yet. Maturi said White had earned the right to return to practice because of high performance in the classroom and had given Smith reason to think he was putting his troubles behind him.

“Coach and I will continue to meet and assess and evaluate what’s the right thing for Royce and what’s the right thing for our program,” Maturi said.

Mbakwe has been on the bench all season while the case for a felony aggravated battery charge against him goes through the legal process. Mbakwe insists it is a case of mistaken identity, but Smith and Maturi have agreed to keep him suspended while the case is open.

Smith was clearly disappointed in Nolen, who is regarded as one of the best perimeter defenders in the Big Ten. When Smith was asked when he first knew about Nolen’s academic problems, the coach bristled.

“He’s the one going to school; he’s the one getting an education,” Smith said. “I heard Coach say a long time ago, you want everyone to get a degree. I can’t get it for them. They’ve got to get it themselves.

“Unfortunately, when you get to be a junior, you’d think you’d understand that.”

Damian Johnson, a co-captain, said all of the losses were starting to take their toll.

“It’s been real tough,” Johnson said. “You see a team that’s got a chance to be one of the top teams in the country. We have a lot of potential. With Trevor and Royce, we would have had a whole different team from the start, big, strong bodies who are very athletic.

“Then you lose a guy that’s one of the top in the Big Ten in assists and steals, a veteran player,” Johnson said of Nolen. “It just really hurts because you know what you could have had. But you can’t dwell on it. So you just have to keep fighting adversity.”

684 2010-01-24 “Maybe Asians are switching from studying to sports,” said Nagasu, a Japanese-American from Arcadia, Calif., and the 2008 national champion.

The influx of Asian skaters can be traced in part to the elimination of compulsory school figures, coaches said. For decades, the etching of figure-eights on the ice counted for 50 percent or more of a skater’s score at competitions. Mastering these tracings took years and miles skating in circles, delaying the development of jumping technique.

Compulsory figures had a major drawback, though. They could be numbing to watch. They grew increasingly less important and were eliminated in 1990.

“TV and the media thought it was the dumbest thing they’d ever seen,” said Kathy Casey, a longtime American coach.

Without compulsory figures, skating became more like gymnastics. Jumping assumed a new urgency. Younger skaters could excel. The key to jumping is to leap high and spin quickly and tightly through two, three or four revolutions before returning to the ice. Asian skaters are often small and willowy, which can be an asset when jumping.

“They have bodies that are quick and light; they’re able to do things very fast,” said Frank Carroll, who coached Kwan and now coaches Nagasu. “It’s like Chinese divers. If you look at those bodies, there’s nothing there. They’re just like nymphs.”

Asian skaters also often adhere to a diet of rice and vegetables and fish, avoiding large quantities of beef and fat, Carroll said. This can make them less vulnerable to weight gain in a sport where five pounds can make a difference between a winning jumper and a struggling one.

Other cultural factors are also at play, coaches said. Discipline at home often transfers to discipline at the rink, Carroll said. Audrey Weisiger, a prominent Chinese-American coach, said: “A lot of Asian families really drive their kids, and I don’t mean in the car. They’re not allowed to be marginal.”

Nagasu’s mother sits at practice and gives hand signals to her daughter, The Chicago Tribune reported. On Friday, Nagasu said her mother had sometimes used corporal punishment, slapping her when she was younger.

“I think my own thinking is harsher than my mom’s discipline,” Nagasu said. “I think it’s because I’m so hard on myself that I can push myself this far.”

She took up skating even though her parents favored golf. Yamaguchi, the 1992 Olympic champion, was also self-motivated. She often woke her mother at 4 in the morning so she could train, said Yuki Saegusa, the agent for both Yamaguchi and Nagasu.

“I think hard work among Asians is the premise of why they succeed,” Saegusa said. “I don’t think that aspect is given enough credit.”

On the other hand, cultural differences may leave some Asian-American skaters feeling uncomfortable in standing out individually or feeling they measure up, coaches and parents said.

“It may not be second nature that they always feel comfortable,” said Chang Gao, the father of the 15-year-old skater Christina Gao of Cincinnati and a former junior national badminton champion in China.

Curiously, China is one place where women’s singles skating has not fully developed, despite two Olympic medals won by Chen Lu in the 1990s. There are not enough coaches and rinks, said Li Ming Zhu, Chen’s former coach.

“It’s better than it was 10 years ago, but in China they don’t have very many young skaters,” Li said.

That is not the case in Japan, which experienced a skating boom after Ito won a world title in 1989 and an Olympic silver medal in 1992. Rinks are being built, too, in South Korea now that Kim has become a world champion and an Olympic favorite.

“You watch these skaters and you think you can do it too,” said Christina Gao, who trains with Kim in Toronto and idolizes Kwan, who won five world championships and two Olympic medals. “It really motivates me.”
685 2010-01-24 Does this mean nevermore? For the first time since 1949, a black-clad figure known as the Poe Toaster failed to show up at Edgar Allan Poe’s gravesite in Baltimore to celebrate the anniversary of the writer’s birth 201 years ago. The visitor, whose identity has remained a mystery, would raise a Cognac toast and leave behind three red roses, along with the remnants of the Cognac bottle. About 30 Poe fans stood in the cold for hours early on Jan. 19 as they waited for the mysterious visitor, The Baltimore Sun reported. Some speculated the toaster might have just had the flu or car trouble — or that he had died. “So many people have said: ‘I hope it’s not over. It was such a nice tradition,’ ” Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House, told the newspaper. “But maybe it has just run its course. It wasn’t going to last forever.”

Correction: January 31, 2010 

 A brief article last Sunday about the failure of a black-clad figure known as the Poe Toaster to show up at Edgar Allan Poe’s grave site in Baltimore to celebrate his Jan. 19 birthday misstated the number of years since Poe was born. It was 201 years ago, in 1809  not 101 years ago.

687 2010-01-24 BAGHDAD — Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. promised Iraqi leaders on Saturday that the United States would appeal the dismissal of manslaughter charges against five Blackwater Worldwide security contractors involved in a deadly shooting here that has inflamed anti-American tensions.

Mr. Biden, tasked by the Obama administration to oversee policy in Iraq, made the statement after a day of meetings with Iraqi leaders that dealt, in part, with a political crisis that has erupted over the March 7 parliamentary elections. American officials view the vote, a barometer of the durability of Iraq’s political system, as a crucial date in American plans to withdraw tens of thousands of combat troops from Iraq by the end of August.

The vice president expressed his “personal regret” for the Blackwater shooting in 2007, in which contractors guarding American diplomats opened fire in a crowded Baghdad traffic circle, killing 17 people, including women and children.

“A dismissal is not an acquittal,” he said after meeting President Jalal Talabani.

Investigators had concluded that the guards fired indiscriminately on unarmed civilians in an unprovoked and unjustified attack. The guards contended that they had been ambushed by insurgents and fired in self-defense.

In December, in a decision that was a blow to the Justice Department and unleashed anger and disbelief in Iraq, a federal judge threw out the five guards’ indictment on manslaughter charges, citing misuse of their statements that violated their constitutional rights. The judge’s scathing and detailed ruling was expected to make any appeal difficult.

“This is great news,” Abdel-Amir Jihan, who was wounded in the shooting, said after hearing of Mr. Biden’s announcement. “The court was not fair to us. We felt great injustice when we heard the verdict. It was not right to drop the charges against them.”
688 2010-01-24 “We were interested to see whether it would be perceived as craft or fine art,” he said. “I think people often get a bit stuck on the line between them.”

When the Sharps approached the British artist Gavin Turk, best known for making cast bronze facsimiles of trash-filled garbage bags, he said he immediately thought of the Italian conceptualist Alighiero e Boetti’s long-running series of embroidered world maps. “I wondered if it was possible to do something that combined my interest in waste with a Boetti kind of image,” he said. “I wondered if we could make the map out of rubbish that we found on the street.”

While making continents from crashed boxes and cans, Mr. Turk mulled over the way painters have rendered volumetric objects throughout art history. “For neo-realism and Pop Art, you would take a solid three-dimensional object, and then you would make it two-dimensional,” he said. “With Cubism you’d look at it from different sides at the same time.” But with his piece, “you start with a three-dimensional object, and then it gets crushed” to the point that it resembles wallpaper. “It’s sculpture to flat,” he said.

The Pakistani-born artist Shahzia Sikander has always played with the process of transformation. Although she studied traditional Indo-Persian miniature painting, she has consistently stretched the boundaries of the genre, mixing up different eras and painting styles and exploring variegated mediums, from drawing and watercolor to video and animation. When offered the chance to work with tapestry, she said, “I wanted to see what would happen in that translation” from drawing to weaving. “I was interested in what would be the obvious loss — the nuances — but obviously the very tactile sensibility of this medium would replace it.”

Yet what’s surprising is how much nuance remained, once her original work — a tiny 12-by-18-inch piece made up of different-sized ink, gouache and graphite drawings collaged on top of one another — was scaled up to 9 by 6 feet and rendered in wool and silk. To convey the details and the multiple layers, some of which are translucent, the artisans chose different weaves, from fine to coarse, and raised silk embroidery.

“There was a sense of lack of control,” Ms. Sikander said, because the execution was carried out by others. “But I was interested in all the other things that would come into the picture.”

Fred Tomaselli has been hooked on Renaissance tapestries since he saw them in a 2002 show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “There’s something in the warp and the woof of those weaves that reminds me very much of pixilation,” he said.

For this project he decided to reinvestigate “Migrant Fruit Thugs” (2006), which, like much of his other work, is “a hybrid of paint, photographic collage and real objects,” he said, including leaves from the fig trees in his own garden, all of it suspended in layers of glistening resin. The challenge lay in translating this multilayered, multimedia work into a uniform weaved surface.

To suggest depth the birds and foliage were fashioned from silk against a black matte wool ground, while the leaves were veined with metallic thread “to impart their life force,” Mr. Tomaselli said. “I’ve always been really inspired by applied arts that aren’t exactly painting or craft, like marquetry and tapestry, and I’ve allowed those influences to be part of my work,” he added. “So it was interesting for me to go back to the source and to make a tapestry out of a work that was probably initially inspired by a tapestry.”
689 2010-01-24 “Boating buff, new in town, seeks partners for intimate romantic getaways on the water. Me: typically Danish — attractive, modern, practical and no-nonsense. You: easy-going and low-maintenance with an appreciation for Nordic aesthetics and taste for simplicity. Divas, hedonists and anyone needing constant attention or pampering need not reply.” That could be the personal ad for the new CPH Living hotel, a stylishly converted two-level barge with 12 rooms that opened in June. Moored in the city’s harbor and billed as “the first floating hotel in Scandinavia,” CPH Living has clearly put a premium on its cool, efficient rooms and lovely waterside views of central Copenhagen. Services and amenities, however, give new meaning to the word “minimalist.”

Though set on a quiet residential bank of the harbor, CPH Living is less than a 15-minute walk from many points of interest, including Central Station, the Radhuspladsen (city square), Tivoli Gardens amusement park and Christianshavn subway station.

Smallish and angular, the standard double rooms are filled with smooth walnut-colored wood surfaces, including the long plank floors and rectangular slab desk. A sleek wooden armoire is a portrait of efficiency, thanks to many clever sliding compartments. Furnishings run the gamut of Scandinavian design, from Ikea desk lamps to the classic Arne Jacobsen wooden desk chairs. The beds, whose mattresses are topped with foam pads, are exceptionally comfortable. Though a flat-screen television is on hand for entertainment, the marquee attraction in each room is the panorama that unfolds through the floor-to-ceiling wall of windows. Lone kayakers, sailboats and families of swans pass lazily by, with the spires of the Copenhagen skyline across the channel beyond. Amid the quiet lapping of waves and the gentle rocking motion, the room creates an exceptionally peaceful cocoon that feels sealed off from the city, a feeling heightened by the lack of a telephone (though there is a Wi-Fi network).

The small mosaic-tile bathrooms are airy and impeccably clean, but feature only a simple sink, toilet and shower. Don’t expect to find a bathtub, heated towel racks, robes, slippers or even toiletries — only a dispenser of bubblegum pink liquid that serves as both soap and shampoo.

“Faciliteter” is the Danish word for “amenities,” but it’s seldom heard at CPH Living. Want a rubdown at a spa or a workout in a gym? You must go find one in the city center. Hungry? The only option is the vending machine in the reception area for a Mars bar (10 Danish kroner, or $2 at 5 kroner to the dollar) and a bottle of Coke (20 kroner). Need to ask the desk about sightseeing tips, arrange for transportation or complain about some problem in the room? You can call the number on the door to the lobby. CPH Living is in the process of installing an A.T.M.-like machine that will register arriving travelers and dispense key cards. Human staff will soon be obsolete. Other than snuggle in your room, the only thing to do is sit and admire the city view from the rooftop sundeck.

Pleasure lovers and luxury buffs, this is not your hotel. But if you’re looking for a secluded love nest, a meditation retreat or a novelist’s garret, CPH Living is a fine option. Though you won’t find any frills — and possibly no hotel employees — the cozy rooms and waterside vista are inspiring and calming.

712 2010-01-25 SPOKANE, Wash.  Minutes after being named to the United States Olympic team late Saturday, more than two hours after the United States Figure Skating Championships had ended, the teenagers Rachael Flatt and Mirai Nagasu bubbled over with joy.

“We’re young and spirited and have lots of enthusiasm, so I think that will bode well for the Olympics,” said Flatt, 17, who won the national title on Saturday with a free skate buoyed by her fearless jumping.

Nagasu, the 2008 national champion and the runner-up Saturday, also has high hopes as an Olympian bound for next month’s Vancouver Games. But first, she is preparing for the perks.

“I’m just excited about all the free stuff we’re going to get,” Nagasu, 16, said of the Olympic team gear and gifts from fans. “I hope a medal will come, too, but you never know.”

She added: “It was Tara Lipinski who won the Olympics, and she wasn’t really well known. At this Olympics, it’s Rachael and me, and we’re going to blow them away. Bam, bam, bam.”

But youth and energy will take a skater only so far at the Olympics, where the competition will be tougher and the judges less forgiving than they were at nationals.

Flatt and Nagasu are also facing the lowest expectations the United States women have had in nearly 50 years. At these Olympics, there will be no established American stars, just rising ones.

No Michelle Kwan, the nine-time national champion, who is no longer skating. No Sasha Cohen, the 2006 Olympic medalist, who mounted a comeback to make her third Olympic team but finished fourth over all at the nationals. Cohen had been second after the short program but fell on a jump and had several other errors in her free skate. (Ashley Wagner was third over all.)

“The U.S. is not on top of figure skating right now,” said Nagasu, a high school junior from Arcadia, Calif., whose parents are from Japan. “I think that’s an embarrassment because of the rich history the U.S.A. has.”

Two American ice-dancing teams  Meryl Davis and Charlie White, and Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto  are top contenders to win an Olympic gold medal. Three American men  Jeremy Abbott, Evan Lysacek and Johnny Weir  are also among the medal contenders in their event.

But based on their recent results, the women do not appear likely to win a medal in Vancouver. They have been on a downswing.

No American woman has won a medal in singles skating for the past three years at the world championships, a streak last matched from 1962 to 1964. The last time the United States women failed to win an Olympic medal was in 1964, three years after the entire figure skating team died in a plane crash. Only four times in history have the American women come home empty-handed from an Olympics: 1964, 1948, 1936 and 1908.

“The Yankees don’t win the World Series every year,” said Scott Hamilton, a 1984 Olympic champion and now a skating commentator. “You have to go through a period of rebuilding, and that’s what is happening with the U.S. women.”

He added: “But I’m still not pessimistic at all. I haven’t given up hope that we can win a medal because some people rise to the occasion, and others crack. The pressure of the Olympics changes everything.”

At the Olympics, Flatt and Nagasu  relative newcomers on the senior skating scene  will face veteran skaters like Canada’s Joannie Rochette, 24, a silver medalist at the 2009 worlds, and Japan’s Miki Ando, the former world champion, who won her two Grand Prix assignments last year. Ando, 22, is the only woman to land a quadruple salchow in competition.

But their most daunting competition will come from the reigning world champion, Kim Yu-na of South Korea. At 19, Kim has a rare combination of spectacular skating skills, grace and dramatic flair.

Neither Flatt nor Nagasu, some coaches say, are as well rounded.

“One is a great athlete, one is an artist,” Frank Carroll, Nagasu’s coach, said of Flatt and Nagasu.

Flatt, who is known less for her artistry than her consistency, finished third in the short program. But after several pep talks from her mentor, the 1976 Olympic gold medalist Dorothy Hamill, and watching the film “Meet the Fockers” to relax, Flatt won the free skate. With seven springy triple jumps, she scored 200.11 points over all.

“I would like to be both steady and spectacular,” said Flatt, a senior and straight A student at Cheyenne Mountain High School in Colorado Springs, where she moved to train. “I have been on the cusp of some really great performances, but I’ve never been completely satisfied.”

Nagasu, who draws in the crowd with her emotion and style, also said she needed to improve before the Olympics. She enthralled fans with a performance to Bizet’s “Carmen,” but three of her triple jumps were downgraded and scored as doubles.

Nagasu said the next several weeks would be the hardest of her life because she had so much work to do. But it is worth it, she said.

She said that she and Flatt would be a big hit at the Olympics, even though they will go in as underdogs.

“We don’t have a strong Michelle Kwan or Kristi Yamaguchi to lead us on,” Nagasu said, “but even though we’re young, we have our big dreams to lead us on.”
713 2010-01-25 In calling for new limits on the size and activities of big , has given the effort to enact serious something it lacked: a rational starting point.

The premise of the White House’s earlier approach to reform was that behemoth multitasking banks were an immutable fact of life and the best way to cope with them was to ensure that their failures would not endanger the rest of the financial system. As a response to the worst since , “make the world safe for giant banks” was unsatisfactory.

It ignored history, and suggested a devotion to the status quo that made real reform seem unlikely. It also ignored that large and complex banks are a problem long before they fail: an overgrown banking sector diverts resources from more productive uses and, in the process, amasses riches at the expense of everyone else. The entire country can see the evidence of that in stagnating wages, disappearing savings, vanishing home equity and taxpayer-supported bonuses.

Mr. Obama’s new proposals begin to correct those problems. They would ban banks with federally insured deposits from making risky bets in the capital markets. And they would prevent the banks from owning, investing or sponsoring hedge funds and funds. Mr. Obama has also called for new caps on the size of banks, to limit the damage that a failure could inflict and to promote healthy competition.

Affected banks would include giants like , and Citibank. and would also fall under the new rules because they were converted to bank holding companies during the crisis so they could qualify for help from the Federal Reserve. But if regulators allow them to drop their bank charters, they would escape the new rules.
714 2010-01-25 Westlaw and LexisNexis, the dominant services in the market for computerized legal research, will undergo sweeping changes in a bid to make it easier and faster for lawyers to find the documents they need.

Lawyers and researchers paying to go online to find court cases and other legal documents should find better-looking interfaces, more relevant search results and new tools for document-sharing and other collaboration.

The changes to the research services are a reaction by Westlaw and LexisNexis to lower-priced — sometimes free — rivals and arrive at a time when law firms are working to cut overhead. The two companies also want to cater to a younger generation of lawyers accustomed to slick Web services and the search interfaces presented by companies like Google and Microsoft.

“I think Westlaw and Lexis have been balancing the needs of an older-generation of lawyers accustomed to using their services with bringing things up to the 21st century,” said Carolyn Elefant, a lawyer who practices in Washington and writes the MyShingle blog. “My guess is that they saw an opportunity to update their platforms with the legal industry in such a state of flux.”

Westlaw will introduce its changes on Feb. 1; LexisNexis has yet to specify a date.

Lawyers and other researchers turn to services like Westlaw and LexisNexis to find a wide variety of legal documents, public records and analysis. A single lawyer might pay about $100 a month for a limited version, while large law firms will pay millions of dollars for unlimited access. Westlaw and LexisNexis each bring in more than $1 billion a year for their respective parent companies, Thomson Reuters and Reed Elsevier.
715 2010-01-25 SCOTT BROWN’S victory last week in the Massachusetts Senate race, following the Republican gubernatorial triumphs in New Jersey and Virginia, marked the third time in three months that the Democratic Party has lost the support and trust of independent voters.

The message these voters sent was clear. With one out of five Americans unemployed or underemployed, President Obama and the Democratic Party need to shift attention away from health care and toward a bold effort to create jobs, improve the economy and rein in the size of government.

Here are four simple steps we must take immediately to put us, and the nation, on a better course:

First, cut taxes for businesses — big and small — and find innovative ways to get Americans back to work. We can start by giving any companies that are less than five years old an exemption from payroll taxes for six months; extending the current capital gains and dividend tax rates through 2012; giving permanent tax credits for businesses that invest in research and development; and reducing the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.

America’s primary job-creating machine — the private sector — needs to be rejuvenated. Democrats must lead now on job creation or risk forfeiting Congressional majorities in November.

Second, we should pass a more focused health reform bill that restructures current health care costs before spending more, prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, enacts responsible reform on malpractice suits and extends health coverage to all children. And we must allow states to have input into the expansion of health coverage, as they will have to pay for much of the reform themselves.
716 2010-01-25 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti  As officials focused Sunday on the Herculean task of this nation’s physical recovery  clearing the wreckage and setting up housing for the hundreds of thousands left homeless by an earthquake  desperate relatives of those still missing pleaded with the authorities not to give up the search.

With so many of this city’s buildings left in ruins and a public health crisis brewing from a failed sanitation system and a shortage of clean water, search and rescue efforts were winding down.

Across this devastated capital, demolition crews were razing buildings teetering dangerously close to collapse, and teams of American surveyors were expected to begin examining the stability of those structures left intact so that people whose homes were spared can move off the streets and businesses can go back to work.

International aid organizations said they had identified three sites to temporarily resettle the homeless. Brazilian teams have begun clearing a field in the Croix des Bouquets neighborhood for a tent city for some 10,000 people, according to Niurka Piñeiro, a spokeswoman for the International Organization for Migration, but it estimates the need at 100,000 tents for families of five, to assist 500,000 people.

Another temporary settlement will be established on Rue de Tabarre for the estimated 4,000 people now camped in squalid conditions on the grounds of the prime minister’s home. A third settlement will be built in the city of Léogâne. And French authorities have said that they will begin efforts to provide water and sanitation to several thousand people crowded in the Champ de Mars plaza downtown.

“Tents, tents, tents,” Ms. Piñeiro said. “That’s the word we want to get out. We need tents.”

The call for aid organizations to focus on shelter came 12 days after the quake, when an estimated 250,000 people were still living under pieces of scavenged tarpaulins, tin and bedsheets. With so many people lacking access to clean water and sanitation, illnesses are running rampant.

“We’re getting a lot of kids with diarrhea,” said Yveline Auguste, who is working at a Haitian hospital on behalf of Catholic Relief Services. So far the cases are generally mild enough to be treated with medicine at home, she said.

But Rick Bauer, a shelter expert for the international aid agency Oxfam, said that the temporary camps would work only if they were secure, their residents were working and the government offered a clear exit strategy.

“The camps must not become warehouses of people waiting for permanent homes that never materialize,” he said.

The Inter-American Development Bank has committed to building 10,000 houses in Léogâne, Ms. Piñeiro said, and further plans for permanent housing will be the focus of a United Nations donors’ conference in Montreal on Monday.

Still, the pivot from rescue to recovery met resistance from relatives of the missing, whose pleas not to give up hope were heard at funerals, demolition sites and displacement camps across the city.

Bulldozers were halted at the Collège du Canapé-Vert when one of the teachers reported getting a telephone message from someone believed trapped in the school’s ruins.

Capt. Christian Morel, leader of a French search team, said that four other teams had searched the school and found no signs of life. He said search teams had received frequent reports of texts or messages from those believed to be dead. But he speculated that either the messages were just now being transmitted as cellphone towers came back on line, or that they were the work of wishful thinking.

Nonetheless, he unleashed search dogs to go over the ruins of the school again. And again he came up with nothing.

That was not enough, however, to convince Madeline Dorville, whose husband, Oriol Randiche, was attending a teacher training program at the school when it collapsed. Tears wetting her cheeks, she said she would be tempted to throw herself in front of the waiting orange bulldozer if it resumed demolition work.

“How can we trust these kinds of decisions to a dog?” she said. “Dogs are not detectives or magicians.”

For others, the thought of starting a new chapter was all the more excruciating because they had not been able to properly close the last one.

“Can you imagine trying to say goodbye to your brother with his body still in the concrete?” asked Lindsay Soliman, 24, a law student who was conducting a funeral service with her family for her brother, Mikenley Soliman, 21. His body lay somewhere under the rubble of a home in the Carrefour district.

Ms. Soliman’s family decided that it was time for his funeral, which they held Sunday at a badly damaged house owned by the Roman Catholic Church, using a photo of him instead of his body.

Mikenley, a computer science student, “dreamed of America like no one,” his sister said. He was a Los Angeles Lakers fan and an aspiring computer programmer who planned to move to Maryland this year after attaining a United States residence visa.

He was watching a soccer game with three friends when the earth shook and the walls of the house fell in. None of the men made it out.

Steeve Hilaire, 27, a police officer and a cousin of Mr. Soliman’s, said he could not understand why the government was in such a hurry to begin clearing away the debris before recovering all who were lost.

“The bulldozers would not be roaring if a government minister’s body or his relatives were under there,” he said. “But when it’s just a regular person, no one cares.”
717 2010-01-25 In the wake of a political setback for national health care legislation, Senator John McCain, the losing candidate in the last presidential election, advised his victorious 2008 adversary on Sunday that the way to get meaningful changes passed is to “start from the beginning” by meeting with Republicans.

Mr. McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said on the CBS news program “Face the Nation” that President Obama should sit down with Republican leaders and begin adopting some of their ideas for improving the nation’s health care system such as overhauling medical malpractice lawsuits, allowing residents of one state to buy health insurance from a company in another state, and granting tax credits for people who purchase health insurance on their own.

The Democrats last week lost a Senate seat in Massachusetts that had given them the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster of a health care bill that appeared on the verge of passage by both houses. Mr. McCain was asked what would Republicans do in response.

“We’d be willing to sit down and start over from the beginning with genuine negotiations,” he replied. “There are things we can agree on.”

Mr. McCain’s advice was treated skeptically by Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, who pointed out on the same show that Mr. Obama met with Republicans at the start of his effort to pass a health reform bill “and asked them to be part of it,” and that 170 Republican amendments had been accepted as the legislation proceeded in House and Senate committees.

741 2010-01-26 The Olympic champion Marianne Timmer will not get to defend her 1,000-meter title after failing to qualify for the Vancouver Games on Monday.

Timmer, a 35-year-old Dutch speedskater, placed third in a three-way skate-off about two months after she smashed her left heel in a high-speed fall.

“I just ran out of time and that is bitter,” said Timmer, who has competed in three Olympics and has won three gold medals. “Give me two more weeks and I know it would be a different contest.”

The Olympic 3,000 champion Ireen Wust won in 1 minute 18.29 seconds and Natasja Bruintjes was second. Even so, Timmer received the standing ovation from the crowd at Thialf Ice Stadium in Heerenveen, the Netherlands.

Timmer was in strong form and already looking forward to her fourth Olympics during a World Cup meet at Thialf in November. But her plans slipped away when she rounded a bend in the 500-meter race and saw the Chinese skater Jing Yu fall in front of her.

Maj. Gen. Maung Oo, the home minister, told a Jan. 21 meeting of businessmen and local officials that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi would be released in November, a month after Myanmar is expected to hold its first parliamentary elections in two decades.
743 2010-01-26 The Treasury issued a statement this month that “taxpayers will be made whole” on certain investments in A.I.G., but its own analysis has estimated that the Treasury will lose $30 billion on the same investments, according to the prepared testimony.

Mr. Barofsky will also announce that he has opened an investigation into possible misconduct in the New York Fed’s efforts to limit A.I.G.’s disclosures about the bailout in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

If there turns out to be a crime in any aspect of the bailout, Mr. Barofsky is not the one who will lay it out before a jury — he does not have the mandate.

“He’s more like the F.B.I. than the Department of Justice,” said Mr. Barkow, the former prosecutor. “He can’t control when his cases are going to be brought.”

Officially, he is not categorized as a special prosecutor; his job is a narrower one, auditing the disbursement of money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He goes by the ungainly title of special inspector general for the TARP, or Sigtarp.

But in an interview in his new quarters in Washington — a building on L Street, a vast improvement over the mildewed Treasury basement where he started out — Mr. Barofsky likened his job to “building a case for a trial.”

“You want to pursue every lead, every bit of evidence, everything to persuade the jury,” he said.

In this case the jury is the public, who suspect they have poured trillions of dollars down a black hole.

“Taxpayers really want to know,” Mr. Barofsky said. “I think too often in Washington, people underestimate how interested the public is.”

There are, in fact, several other panels charged with reviewing and monitoring the bailout. But Mr. Barofsky is the only one backed by federal agents who carry guns and badges and, if necessary, can break the locks off file cabinets.

Those added powers, and an attitude honed during eight years of fighting white-collar criminals and Colombian drug lords as an assistant United States attorney — he still has the knife from a foiled attempt on his life in a field outside Bogota — are propelling Mr. Barofsky over barriers that have slowed the others.

Not long after his nomination was confirmed at the end of 2008, he beat back an effort by the Treasury to have his office put under supervision of the secretary.

He also forced the Treasury to let him obtain a statement, under oath, from every recipient bank about how it used the taxpayers’ money.

“We were told we were playing politics,” he said of that battle over several months with the Treasury, which said the recipients should be required to disclose only their lending activity. “That it was a meaningless exercise. At least three times, we were told we should consider it closed.”

Mr. Barofsky’s report on the uses of government money found that some institutions had applied it to projects that directly contradicted the Congressional intent for the program.

The public seems pleased that someone is standing up to the banks and the officials who bailed them out. A Web site that Mr. Barofsky set up for tips has received about 30 million hits, he said. And Congress expanded his powers last year.

He made his most recent waves in November, when he issued the results of an eight-month audit of how tens of billions of dollars, sent by the government to a teetering A.I.G., wound up at a group of big banks in the United States and Europe.

The audit was requested by Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat of Maryland, who rounded up 26 other Democrats to sign his letter in March 2009. But by the time it was finished, it was pounced on by a no-holds-barred Republican, Darrell Issa of California, who called it “extremely useful in laying the foundation for our investigation.”

The report describes how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sealed its own fate in September 2008, when it tried unsuccessfully to put together a private bank loan for A.I.G., then in the throes of a terrifying worldwide run on the bank.

“This is the moment when the greatest amount of leverage to negotiate exists,” said Mr. Barofsky.

But instead of negotiating from a position of strength, the New York Fed poured $85 billion of its own money into A.I.G., on hard-nosed terms that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase had planned to charge before they got cold feet. Much of the Fed’s money was gone within minutes — and so was the Fed’s leverage, or any real chance of getting the money back.

“I don’t want to play Monday morning quarterback, but there are other things that could have happened,” Mr. Barofsky said. He said the Fed could have achieved better results if it had behaved more like a regulator and less like a creditor.

Mr. Issa, the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, recently asked to see the original documents that Mr. Barofsky had collected while conducting that audit. Mr. Barofsky politely declined, saying that to gain the Fed’s cooperation, he had promised not to give out its documents without its permission.

Left empty-handed, Mr. Issa suddenly found himself on rare common ground with the Oversight Committee’s Democratic chairman, Edolphus Towns of New York. Mr. Towns took Mr. Issa’s cue and subpoenaed the Fed documents, and also called the Wednesday hearing, where the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, will answer questions, as will Mr. Barofsky, among others. Mr. Paulson may also appear but has not confirmed.

Congressional staff members have been circulating e-mail messages showing close interactions between A.I.G. and the New York Fed in deciding how much information should be made public.

Mr. Barofsky said that as a lifelong Democrat, he was caught off-guard by his selection by President George W. Bush. He was three years into a complicated criminal case, and moving to Washington would disrupt his plans for a January wedding and honeymoon in Costa Rica.

His boss, the United States attorney, persuaded him with what he called “the God-and-country speech,” Mr. Barofsky said. The honeymoon was postponed until May.

When he arrived in Washington, he said he was shocked to find how much money was flying out the door, with so few controls.

In one conference call, he said, he asked what safeguards would be built into a new program to help investors buy banks’ impaired assets.

“They said, ‘Rating agencies and investor due diligence,’ and my jaw just dropped,” he said. “They said, ‘Yes, the ratings agencies will not be embarrassed again.’ I can’t tell you how often I heard the phrase, ‘reputational risk.’ ‘Oh, the banks wouldn’t do that.’ This is trying to shame the shameless.”

The Fed and Treasury have grown more receptive to his ideas, he said. And his office has also grown. It now has a branch in New York, and there are plans for two more in California.

“We’re following the TARP crimes,” he said.
744 2010-01-26 For now, at least, the technology and media industries are looking at the brighter side. “Steve believes in old media companies and wants them to do well,” said a person who has seen the device and is familiar with Apple’s marketing plan for it, but who did not want to be named because talking about it might alienate him from the company. “He believes democracy is hinged on a free press and that depends on there being a professional press.”

Part of the media industry’s high hope for the tablet comes from descriptions of the device from analysts and others who have been briefed on it.

It will run all the applications of the and Touch, have a persistent wireless connection over 3G cellphone networks and Wi-Fi, and will be built with a 10-inch color display, allowing newspapers, magazines and book publishers to deliver their products with an eye to the design that had grabbed readers in print.

Their optimism for the tablet also stems from consumers’ willingness to spend money using mobile devices. In the last decade, while people downloaded music illegally to their desktop computers, they happily paid small amounts of money on their cellphones to download ring tones and send .

The iPhone has provided further proof that the economics of mobile devices are unique: the Apple App Store is expected to generate an estimated $1.4 billion this year, according to an analysis by Piper Jaffray.

“The iPhone was a harbinger,” said Trip Hawkins, a founder of Electronic Arts and now chief executive of Digital Chocolate, which makes games for cellphones. “When you have a device that is this convenient and fun for consumers to use, you can get a lot more people interested in paying for and engaging with the content. Big media companies should be all over this like a cheap suit.”

Indeed, they already are. , for example, is developing a version of its newspaper for the tablet, according to a person briefed on the effort, although executives declined to say what sort of deal had been struck.

On Monday, The Times also announced that its media group division had created a new segment for “reader applications,” and named Yasmin Namini, the senior vice president for marketing and circulation, to head it. Executives said the timing was coincidental, prompted not by the Apple device specifically, but by the growing importance to The Times of electronic reading devices in general.

At least three publishers, Hearst, Condé Nast and Time, have also created mockups of their magazines for tablets, even before such devices have hit the market. “Apple upended the smartphone market with the introduction of the iPhone, and it’s likely that they will, if they enter the tablet market, lead the pace there,” said Thomas J. Wallace, editorial director of Condé Nast. He said that “2010 is going to be the year of the tablet, and we feel we are in a very good position for it.”

To successfully sell their material on the coming wave of tablets from Apple and other hardware makers like , media companies may first have to adjust other parts of their digital strategies — so consumers don’t simply use the tablet’s browser to get the same content free on the Web.

Such shifts are under way.

In October, The , which is owned by the , began charging for access for certain elements of its iPhone application. Esquire and GQ have taken steps toward charging for digital content, offering iPhone versions of their magazines for $2.99 for each issue.

The December issue of GQ was downloaded from the app store almost 7,000 times, and twice as many times for its January issue. Last week, announced plans to begin charging, by next year, frequent Web site visitors who are not also newspaper subscribers to read the online version.

Media companies may have to swallow hard before tethering their futures to any high-tech company, let alone Apple. Many publishers believe their economic health depends on finding a direct line to their customers, and it is not clear whether Apple — and other aggregators of Internet content — will allow that.

Magazine publishers, for example, maintain sophisticated databases about their customers, which lets them cross-sell products, renew subscriptions and entice advertisers with statistics about their wealthy readers. A big part of the business is automatic renewals charged to credit cards.

But when magazine publishers sell applications through the iTunes store, they do not get credit card information or even the name of the buyer.

However, Apple, which makes most of its money selling devices, not content, has shown itself in some cases to be a more benevolent warden of online content, than, say, . Unlike with the , Apple allows application makers to set their own prices; some, like The Financial Times, give away applications for the iPhone, but then bill customers directly for repeat use.

Nevertheless, concern over preserving the customer relationship is one reason, late last year, that major publishers including , Condé Nast, , the News Corporation and Hearst announced they had formed a consortium, called Next Issue Media, that plans to run its own online store selling digital issues and collecting consumer information.

“It’s fundamental to the business model of publishers,” John Squires, the interim managing director of the consortium, said last month. “We’ve always enjoyed an opportunity to know exactly where our consumers are, and be able to market other products to them. It’s a very key issue for the founding members of this business.”

One branch of big media whose fortunes may not be lifted by an Apple tablet, at least initially, is the TV business. Apple has also talked to television networks about offering access, for a monthly fee, to a selection of their hit shows, bypassing traditional distributors.

But perhaps smarting from their experiences with Apple, many of the old-line media companies — , Viacom and Discovery among them — shrugged at (or totally dismissed) Apple’s plans for a TV subscription package, according to executives briefed on the talks. A person briefed on Apple’s plans confirmed that such a subscription video option was not part of any immediate offering.
745 2010-01-26 To most renters in New York City, it sounds like a modest, even enviable, rent increase: Pay an additional $45 if your monthly rent happened to be less than $1,000 and you had been living in the same apartment for more than six years.

But to the City Council, and advocates for New York’s lower-paying tenants, the increase issued by the city’s Rent Guidelines Board in 2008 amounted to what they called a “poor tax.” And in a ruling last week, Justice Emily Jane Goodman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan agreed. Should the ruling stand — the city plans to appeal it — some 300,000 rent-stabilized tenants could receive rebates and small reductions in their rent.

The ruling stemmed from the rent increases approved by the city’s Rent Guidelines Board in 2008. The board allowed landlords of rent-subsidized apartments to raise rents by 4.5 percent for one-year leases, and 8.5 percent for two-year leases.

The board also passed a minimum increase for anyone who had been living in an apartment for more than six years: They would have to pay at least $45 and $85 for one- and two-year leases, respectively. This meant that any long-term tenant paying less than $1,000 a month would be faced with a higher percentage increase than other rent-stabilized tenants. The rule was called Order No. 40.

The motivation behind the board’s increase was to compensate landlords for rising operational costs and to equalize rents between long- and short-term tenants, according to court papers. But the City Council and some Legal Aid lawyers cried foul, claiming in a September 2008 lawsuit that lower-income tenants were being unfairly singled out.

In her decision siding with the plaintiffs, Judge Goodman ruled that the Rent Guidelines Board did not have the authority to impose a separate rent increase for those tenants. She cited the case of Paul Hertgen, an out-of-work truck driver who had been living in the same apartment on Staten Island for 18 years. Under the new guidelines, his rent rose to $770 from $685, a 12 percent increase. Had he been subject to the 8.5 percent increase that others were required to pay, his rent would have been $743.
746 2010-01-26 Mr. Darling’s point is perhaps the most significant, because it goes directly to this notion of money moving around the world to chase returns. So banks in the United States may shrink because of the new rules, but will it matter if banks in China, so closely connected with ours, end up being twice the size?

After all, in an age of global banking, being too big to fail is not a national problem. Remember Iceland?

Indeed, within hours of Mr. Obama’s announcement of the Volcker Rule last week, Wall Street banks were looking for ways to skirt it and figure out which of their international rivals would fall under it.

For example, Deutsche Bank, an increasingly powerful presence in the United States, has a private equity arm called RREEF. Would Deutsche need to divest it?

At Goldman Sachs, there are questions about whether it can shed its bank holding company status so it can continue to pursue proprietary trading, or whether it would still be allowed to do that abroad through a subsidiary.

“We now see single-country solutions being developed,” said Howard J. Davies, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority who is now director of the London School of Economics and Political Science and a board member of Morgan Stanley. “They all have respectable rationales behind them, but are uncoordinated and bring risks of regulatory arbitrage.”

Mr. Davies, who plans to be in Davos, may present a plan for a global regulator with real power — “A kind of financial W.T.O., if you like,” as he describes it.

He said he is particularly concerned that a patchwork of uncoordinated reforms could lead to overregulation.

“If we add all the new proposals together — levies, Basel 3, leverage ratios, macroprudential capital requirements, Volcker rules, transaction taxes, systemic risk charges, etc., etc., we could move into an environment of reckless prudence,” he added.

Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who is also planning to travel to Davos (thereby providing cover to all the Wall Street chiefs who might otherwise be derided for flying to Switzerland for a slope-side boondoggle), is worried that arguments like Mr. Davies’ — taken to the extreme — will be used to stifle reform.

“The objections to tough restrictions in the United States are that it will put American businesses in a disadvantaged position and financial companies will take their operations to friendlier shores,” he said in a statement. “I believe this is wrong, and, in fact, since becoming chairman of the Financial Services Committee, I and other American officials have been working with others to prevent this situation from arising.” He added, “My major goal this week is to further our efforts at cooperation and work to prevent any national regulatory approaches that allow companies to dodge the kind of accountability and responsibility that is needed.”

There is one thing, though, that everyone in Davos can agree on: the public outrage around the world is still palpable.

That may give the regulators an important stick to push through reforms — even if they are temporary taxes on banks that are unlikely to lead to substantive changes.

“As a result of the advancement by U.S. President Obama and the financial secretary Tim Geithner about their levy on wholesale lending, I think the proposals that I made at St. Andrews for an international levy,” Mr. Brown said, “are now gaining currency around the world.”

But getting at real reform that will reshape the underwriting of the global financial system will take more than chest-thumps and one-upmanship among heads of states. We may still need a global sheriff.
747 2010-01-26 Re “Children Don’t Have Strokes? Just Ask Jared” (Jan. 19): In May 2000, our newborn daughter presented with seizures, sleep apnea and stridor while in the nursery. It was two days before her diagnosis of stroke. Kate received world-class care. She might have more mobility now, however, if stroke had been suspected and looked for sooner rather than later.

It is heartening to see that this once inconceivable health concern is being discussed so openly. When the erroneous idea that “kids can’t have strokes” is erased from our collective conscience, the youngest victims will receive much-needed care much sooner.
748 2010-01-26 Apple said Monday that it earned $3.38 billion in its most recent quarter, handily beating Wall Street’s optimistic expectations with record sales of Macs and iPhones.

The profit, which came to $3.67 a share, was up nearly 50 percent from the $2.26 billion, or $2.50 a share, it earned a year earlier. Revenue for the period, which was the first quarter of Apple’s fiscal year, rose to $15.68 billion, from $11.88 billion in the first quarter of last year.

“We’re thrilled to report our best quarter ever,” Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with investors on Monday. “We set new records in sales of Macs and iPhones. We’re shipping the best products in history and our customers love them.”

Updated versions of Apple’s Macintosh laptop and desktop computers helped sales, the company said. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., sold 3.36 million Macs in the quarter, up 33 percent from the 2.5 million it sold in the same period a year earlier.

In part, the returns were a result of a change in the way Apple tallies revenue from each sale of the iPhone.

Previously, the company deferred the revenue over a period of 24 months to account for the life cycle of the product. But beginning in the first quarter, the revenue from each sale is recognized immediately.

“They threw everyone a curveball at the last minute,” said Carl Howe, an analyst with the Yankee Group. “But the good news is their financial numbers should show the effects of new products more quickly, which is timely, considering they are about to launch a hot new product.”
749 2010-01-26 Mr. Cera was the first actor to sign on for the project and worked on the screenplay with another veteran of the teen-angst genre, the screenwriter Gustin Nash (“Charlie Bartlett”), and the director Miguel Arteta (“Chuck & Buck”). The three helped condense the 500-page novel — which includes adventures in arson, heavy petting and cross-dressing — into a tidy 90 minutes.

“We tried to touch upon things that were important to the novel,” said Mr. Arteta. “But the most important thing was keeping the voice of C. D. Payne.”

All of which has pleasantly surprised Mr. Payne, a quiet, unassuming 60-year-old — married with pet — who lives in this rustic Sonoma County town, about 50 miles north of San Francisco.

Born into a blue-collar family in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Payne started writing because “it was the only thing I tried in life I didn’t find boring,” he said.

“And for years,” he continued, “I couldn’t make any money at it.”

After making his way to Harvard, where he earned a history degree, Mr. Payne decamped to California in the early 1970s, eventually living in a trailer in Santa Monica, while dabbling in short humor, screenplays and even cartoons, all to negligible success. “I did the standard thing,” he said. “And I got all the rejections.”

By the late 1980s, he was living in the Bay Area and commuting to the Sharper Image, the San Francisco retailer of consumer gadgetry (since bankrupted), working as a bored-senseless copywriter. Mr. Payne said he began writing “Youth in Revolt” as a kind of psychic safety valve.

“After you’ve written about 23 cordless phones, the novelty kind of wears off,” he said. “The nature of advertising is that you have to be enthusiastic and positive all the time. ‘Youth in Revolt’ was kind of the reverse of that.”

What emerged was the story of Nick and his great love, Sheenie, a pretty and pretentious young lady described in the book as “one of two intellectuals living in Ukiah, Calif.,” and the only one studying “French-language tapes.” Nick is instantly infatuated, soon abandoning both caution and his family.

“Nick has no filter between his impulse and his actions,” Mr. Payne said. “He’s really obsessed with Sheenie, and stories about obsessive characters are a good source of humor because they are so committed and deranged.”

Still, the book, which took three years to write, was rebuffed by publishers. So Mr. Payne used a small nest egg, designed a hand-drawn cover with plenty of décolletage, and printed 3,000 copies, which he distributed to libraries and bookstores in Berkeley, where he was living at the time. Once again, it was not a roaring success.

“Some put it out on the shelves,” he said, “and some threw them away.”

In 1994, however, Mr. Payne’s version of the book landed on the desk of Bruce Tracy, then an editor at Doubleday Books. “I thought it was the funniest thing I’d ever read,” he said. “And it had this fantastic cover, kind of Stan Mack meets R. Crumb.”

Doubleday published a hardcover version of the book in 1995, and after a rapturous review in The Los Angeles Times, “Youth in Revolt” was briefly considered as a television show for Fox and MTV. It was not picked up, but the recent movie version, released by Dimension Films, has once again aroused television interest, though it has performed modestly at the box office, with about $15 million in ticket sales since its Jan. 8 release.

The idea that the film might generate a whole new generation of Twisp fans pleases Mr. Cera, who calls the book — and the movie — a “true love story.”

Mr. Payne continues methodically writing a number of projects (he’s mulling a fourth sequel to “Youth”) and using his down time to tend to a series of campers, mobile homes and trailers, both miniature and full size, which he has collected over the years. (He and his wife, Joy, drove to the movie’s premiere in a truck topped with a camper shell and stayed in an RV park north of Hollywood.)

His most prized possession is a restored 1964 Airstream trailer, called Eyelusion, which Mr. Payne has turned into a traveling museum of oddities and handmade optical illusions. During the summers Mr. Payne still drives the Eyelusion to various county fairs, charging a dollar or two for tours, something he says helps pay for his writing habit.

“I have no faith that literature is going to pan out on a long-term basis, so I have to have a backup,” Mr. Payne said “It’s worked out pretty well so far, but I don’t know, you know? I could be a flash in the pan.”
750 2010-01-26 He was also convicted for his role in crushing a Shiite uprising in southern Iraq in 1991, in which thousands were killed and displaced.

“His execution is great news for all Iraqis,” said Fakhri Karim, an adviser to President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd. “He was the killing machine of the former regime.”

He was hanged on Monday for his role in the Anfal campaign, an official from the Justice Ministry said.

Kao Mahmoud, a spokesman for the government of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, said that Kurdish officials would pursue their efforts to classify the attack on Halabja as genocide.

The government announced his execution shortly after three devastating bombings struck hotels in Baghdad, killing 36 people, in what appeared to be a coordinated attack.

The delays in executing Mr. Majid stood in contrast to the speed with which Mr. Hussein’s death sentence was carried out. Mr. Hussein was sentenced Nov. 5, 2006; his appeal was rejected on Dec. 26 that year; and he went to the gallows just before dawn within four days. Video was soon circulated of Mr. Hussein’s confrontation with guards.

Ali Dabbagh, the government’s spokesman, said that Mr. Majid’s execution “happened without any violations, shouting or cries of joy,” unlike that of Mr. Hussein.

Throughout his courtroom appearances and until last week, Mr. Majid remained unapologetic, explaining to the court during the Anfal trial that he had ordered the destruction of Kurdish villages because they were filled with Iranian agents.

“I am the one who gave orders to the army to demolish villages and relocate villagers,” Mr. Majid had said during one of the hearings. “I am not defending myself, I am not apologizing. I did not make a mistake.”

“Thanks to God,” an unrepentant Mr. Majid said last week when his eighth death sentence was read out in court.

On June 24, 2007, the court sentenced Mr. Majid and a former defense minister, Sultan Hashem Ahmed, to death for their role in the Anfal campaign. Mr. Majid’s sentence was set to be carried out on Oct. 16, but was postponed because of wrangling over Mr. Ahmed’s execution. Several top Iraqi leaders and American commanders wanted to spare him.

Mr. Ahmed received a 15-year prison sentence last week for his role in the Halabja attack. It is not clear yet if or when he will be executed.

“Until now, there isn’t an executive order to execute him,” said Bosho Dizai, the deputy justice minister. “We don’t know what will happen yet.”

Mr. Ahmed was a top officer for decades, winning respect from many Iraqis for his professionalism. Some American officials said he helped limit the resistance of the Iraqi army to the invasion in 2003, and many Sunni leaders said he was simply a soldier following Mr. Majid’s orders.

After the 2003 American-led invasion, Mr. Ahmed fled to Mosul, where Gen. David H. Petraeus, then a major general in charge of military operations in the north, praised him as a “man of honor and integrity” and asked him to surrender in a letter stating that by doing so, he could “avoid capture, imprisonment and loss of honor and dignity befitting a general officer.”

But because of his role in the Anfal campaign, both Shiite and Kurdish officials believed that if Mr. Ahmed’s life was spared, it could set a precedent by which others who committed crimes would also seek to be let off. Some also feared executing Mr. Ahmed would affect efforts to persuade Sunnis to reconcile with a government now dominated by Shiites.

Mr. Majid, a first cousin to Mr. Hussein, was captured on Aug. 17, 2003, five months after the invasion of Iraq. He was listed as the fifth most-wanted men and as King of Spades in the pack of cards of most wanted issued by the US military in 2003.

He was a soldier in the Iraqi army until Mr. Hussein’s Baath party seized power in a bloody coup in 1968 when he was appointed an aide to the defense minister. When Mr. Hussein became president in 1979, he was promoted to head of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. In the late 1980s, he was appointed secretary general of the northern bureau of the Baath Party, where he demonstrated ruthlessness against Kurdish rebels.

Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, he was named military governor of the emirate. In 1991 he became interior minister and was charged with quelling the Shiite uprising that broke out that year against Mr. Hussein in the south.

In 1995 he became defense minister but was dismissed shortly afterward when Mr. Hussein discovered he was involved in smuggling illegal grain to Iran.

Three years later, he was brought back and appointed commander of southern Iraq, a position he kept until the invasion.
751 2010-01-26 The Chinese government’s comments come atop months of increasingly stringent limits on what average Chinese citizens can view on the Internet, and increasingly strict programs to monitor those who try to view unapproved content.

From blocking or closing down thousands of blogs and social-networking sites to accusing the United States of seeking information hegemony, the government has made it clear that the control of information has become even more of a central priority than in years past, according to David Bandurski, an analyst and author at the Hong Kong-based China Media Project, who spoke in a telephone interview on Monday.

“The C.C.P. media worldview is that you have China versus a hostile West in this global war for public opinion,” he said, referring to the China Communist Party. China’s paradox, he said, is that while Beijing accuses the United States of “information imperialism,” its own policies seek to shut out dissenting voices — including those of many of its own citizens — and to make the Beijing government’s view of the world China’s dominant voice.

Monday’s fusillade by the Chinese not only dismissed Mrs. Clinton’s statements, but also depicted the United States as cyberspace’s villain and China as its unwilling victim.

Zhou Yonglin, the deputy operations chief of China’s National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, was quoted as saying that China was the world’s largest target for hackers, with more than 262,000 Internet addresses under assault last year, and that the greatest share of attacks — one in six — originated in the United States.

Mr. Zhou also questioned Google’s claim that attacks on its computers had been traced to Chinese soil, saying that other American companies had sought his agency’s help after previous attacks, but that it “has not been alerted to any specific report on the issue submitted by Google.”

“We have been hoping that Google will contact us so that we could have details on this issue and provide them help if necessary,” he said in the interview, which was conducted by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

Separately, an unidentified spokesman for the State Council Information Office defended as “totally correct” China’s censorship of Internet sites that the government deems harmful. “We are resolutely against those who make a issue of things without referring to actual facts by needlessly accusing China, ignoring Chinese laws and interfering in Chinese internal politics,” the spokesman told Xinhua.

The State Council, the rough equivalent of the American government’s cabinet, is among the most powerful Chinese governing bodies.

The sharpest language, however, came from the Communist Party-backed Global Times, which frequently criticizes American policy. The newspaper quoted a Chinese analyst as calling Google’s complaint “a U.S. government-initiated strategy with covert political intentions.”

“As the global landscape is undergoing profound irreversible shifts, the calculated free-Internet scheme is just one step of a U.S. tactic to preserve its hegemonic domination,” Yan Xuetong, who heads the Institute of International Studies at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, said in the article.

A separate article noted that the United States Congress expanded the power of security agencies to monitor Americans’ e-mail and Internet activities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and it accused Mrs. Clinton of preaching a double standard by criticizing China’s limitations on Internet freedoms.
752 2010-01-26 “The local Chinese court has no jurisdiction over this case,” said Mo Shaoping, the head of the law firm representing Mr. Zhou, adding that there was not enough evidence to convict him of financial fraud. (The fraud conviction was related to the bank incident, not to the fake passport, Mr. Mo said.)

The Hong Kong police violated Mr. Zhou’s rights by handing him over to the police in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen without explanation, Mr. Mo said. Before that, the police held him for seven months in Hong Kong without charging him, Mr. Mo added.

The Hong Kong legal code was set up by British colonialists and is far different from that of the mainland, falling under the “one country, two systems” form of governing that China promised after Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997. Hong Kong has no extradition agreement with mainland China. The Hong Kong government has declined to comment on the case, but some Hong Kong politicians have taken up Mr. Zhou’s cause.

Mr. Mo said Hong Kong law dictated that Mr. Zhou, when caught at the border with a fake passport, should have been sent back to Macao, where he was entering from, or to the United States, where he is a permanent resident and is close to getting American citizenship. The Chinese government stripped Mr. Zhou of full citizenship when he fled the mainland and has refused to reinstate it, Mr. Mo said.

The financial fraud investigation began when Hang Seng Bank, based in Hong Kong, told the authorities that someone had forged a signature to try to transfer money from a bank account registered under the name of Wang Xingxiang, the name on Mr. Zhou’s fake passport.

Zhang Yuewei, Mr. Zhou’s longtime partner in Los Angeles and the mother of their 21-month-old daughter, said that Mr. Zhou had been given his fake passport by an immigration agency, a common practice among Chinese exiles who want to travel, and that the overlap in the names was an unfortunate coincidence.

The South China Morning Post, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, reported last week in an article without a byline that Wang Xingxiang was also a name used by Zhang Hongbao, the founder of a spiritual movement called Zhong Gong that was among several such groups banned on the mainland in 1999. The groups all practiced qigong, a form of meditation and exercise; Falun Gong is the most famous of the groups. Mr. Zhang died in a car accident in the United States in 2006.

Mr. Mo said the Hong Kong police had concluded that Mr. Zhou was not the one who faked the signature on the money transfer form given to Hang Seng Bank. The requested transfer was reportedly for about $772,000.

“We’ll fight to the end,” Ms. Zhang said in a telephone interview. “Yongjun was treated unfairly. His parents want to go to Beijing to petition, but they’re too old.”
753 2010-01-26 BEIJING — Health officials in southern China have swept frozen confections and other dairy products from stores after discovering they contained melamine, the industrial compound at the center of a tainted-food scandal that rocked China’s dairy industry in 2008, news reports said Monday.

It was the third time in a month that Chinese authorities had announced problems related to melamine, suggesting that producers are still making and selling tainted food ingredients despite outrage over the 2008 scandal and what the government heralded as a crackdown.

The former head of the Guangdong Provincial Dairy Association, Wang Dingmian, confirmed the recalls in a telephone conversation. Mr. Wang, who has often taken on the role of spokesman for dairy companies in southern China, refused to provide further details.

The latest case took place in Guizhou, a province in the south of China’s interior. The provincial newspaper Guiyang Daily reported that food companies from Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces and the city of Shanghai had produced the tainted products in March and April 2009. The companies’ officials were reported to have said that the melamine was in milk powder they bought elsewhere to use as an ingredient.

The state-run newspaper China Daily reported Monday that the three companies were banned from selling products in Guizhou.
754 2010-01-26 It is not a perfect situation, the relationship between coyote tobacco and hawkmoths.

Sure, the hawkmoth does a good job of pollinating the plant, Nicotiana attenuata, which grows in the Western United States and flowers at night. But the hawkmoth has this habit of leaving behind its eggs, which develop into caterpillars that like nothing better than to eat the plant.

So N. attenuata strikes back in a novel way, according to scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. As they describe in Current Biology, it shifts the time of its flowering to mornings and attracts a different pollinator, a hummingbird.

“Nobody had actually noticed this before,” said Ian T. Baldwin, director of the institute and senior author of the Current Biology paper. He said Danny Kessler, the lead author, was taking photographs one day of a plant that happened to be attacked by caterpillars. “Out of the blue, the flowers opened in the morning,” he said.

Munching caterpillars produce oral secretions that “activate a whole series of defense responses,” Dr. Baldwin said, including the production of toxins and protease inhibitors that decrease the caterpillars’ digestive ability. The change in flowering time, he said, “is a fourth major group of events that are activated by caterpillar attack.”

By shifting pollinators, the plant reduces the damage from hawkmoths. But why doesn’t it eliminate hawkmoth pollination? Probably because the hawkmoth is a better pollinator than hummingbirds — it travels farther and visits more plants. “The tobacco plant gets superior pollination services out of the hawkmoth,” Dr. Baldwin said.

788 2010-01-27 SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells on Wednesday from its shoreline into waters near its disputed western sea border with South Korea, and the South Korean military returned warning shots from smaller weapons, according to South Korean military officials and fishermen on a border island.

After the morning barrage, South Korea issued three warning broadcasts and then its marines based on a border island unleashed about 100 warning shots with their antiaircraft guns.

Neither side reported casualties or damage. The North Korean military warned in a statement that more shells would be on their way as part of a winter training exercise, highlighting instability in the western waters, the most volatile segment of the Koreas’ border.

On Wednesday morning, about 30 rounds of North Korean artillery splashed into two spots just north of the so-called Northern Limit Line, a United Nations-drawn sea border accepted by the South but disputed by the North, said a spokesman at the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul, who spoke on condition of anonymity until the government made a formal announcement.

Hours later, North Korea fired a new barrage involving “tens of shells,” the official said.

The rising tension at sea comes amid recent signals from Pyongyang that it was ready to return six-nation talks on ending its nuclear weapons program. In return for resuming the talks, North Korea has demanded talks on a peace treaty with the United States to formally end the 1950-3 Korean War and the lifting of United Nations sanctions tightened after its two nuclear tests.
789 2010-01-27 Federal officials have ended their investigation of the finances of Representative Alan B.

790 2010-01-27 WASHINGTON— Justice Sandra Day O’Connor did not sound happy on Tuesday about the Supreme Court’s big campaign finance decision last week. It repudiated a major part of a ruling Justice O’Connor helped write before her retirement from the court in 2006, and it complicated her recent efforts to do away with judicial elections.

“Gosh,” she said, “I step away for a couple of years and there’s no telling what’s going to happen.”

Justice O’Connor criticized the recent decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, only obliquely, reminding the audience that she had been among the authors of McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, the 2003 decision that was overruled in large part on Thursday.

“If you want my legal opinion” about Citizens United, Justice O’Connor said, “you can go read” McConnell.

Justice O’Connor gave her thoughts at a conference at Georgetown University Law Center on judicial selection in the aftermath of Citizens United and last year’s Supreme Court decision on judicial recusal, Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.
791 2010-01-27 Ruth Proskauer Smith, a longtime reproductive rights advocate who helped found what is now Naral Pro-Choice America, died Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 102.

In 1969, Mrs. Smith and 11 others formed the first steering committee of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, as the organization was then known. (In 1973, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade made abortion legal nationwide, the group’s name was changed to the National Abortion Rights Action League; it adopted its present name in 2003.)

In recent years, Mrs. Smith remained involved with Naral Pro-Choice New York, an affiliate of the national body. She was also active in the right-to-die movement, advocating that physician-assisted suicide be legally available to terminally ill people.

Ruth Proskauer was born on Aug. 14, 1907, in Deal, N.J., and reared in Manhattan. Hers was a distinguished family: her father, Judge Joseph M. Proskauer, served on the New York State Supreme Court before becoming a partner in the law firm now known as Proskauer Rose. Her mother, the former Alice Naumburg, helped found the Euthanasia Society of America, a right-to-die group. As a young woman, Ruth received her first public-speaking lesson from Gov. Alfred E. Smith, to whom her father was a close adviser.

Ruth Proskauer earned a bachelor’s degree from Radcliffe in 1929, followed by a master of fine arts from Radcliffe in 1932. She became a fieldworker for the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts in the 1940s and was later its executive secretary. Afterward, she held high positions with several national reproductive rights organizations.

In 1932 she married Theodore Smith; the marriage ended in divorce. Besides her son, Anthony, of Manhattan, Mrs. Smith is survived by a daughter, Gael S. Arnold, of Washington; six grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

For the past two decades, until after her 102nd birthday, Mrs. Smith led a regular seminar on the Supreme Court at Quest, an educational program for retired professionals affiliated with the Center for Worker Education of the City College of New York.
792 2010-01-27 ALBANY — The agency that runs the state’s juvenile prison system routinely violates the law by shackling youthful offenders when taking them to court even when the youth poses no obvious threat, a state judge ruled on Tuesday.

The case was brought on behalf of a teenager identified as John F., who was kept in shackles — his hands and feet handcuffed, with a belly chain linked to the handcuffs — for about 15 hours one day while being taken to court. He was 14 and had no record of violent crime, said the lawyers who represented him.

The ruling, by Justice Milton A. Tingling Jr. of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, would repeal a policy of the state’s youth correctional system that has been in place since at least 1996. It is the latest controversy for a system that has been widely faulted for doing what critics say is an abysmal job of meeting the needs of juvenile offenders.

The case, a class-action lawsuit on behalf of about 500 youths held in residential centers run by the state’s Office of Children and Family Services, was brought by the Legal Aid Society. Justice Tingling issued his decision as a summary judgment against state officials, who did not contest the facts of the case, meaning that it is unlikely that they would win an appeal.

“The court’s recognition that O.C.F.S. cannot treat children this way is part and parcel of a culture of abusive practices that is not rehabilitative and does not recognize that these are children who are in the care of the state,” said Nancy Rosenbloom, the Legal Aid lawyer leading the case.
793 2010-01-27 WASHINGTON  For all the questions circulating in Democratic quarters as President Obama tries to weather the worst storm of his administration, perhaps none is as succinct as this: Are the missteps at the White House rooted in message or substance?

The Republican victory in Massachusetts last week touched off a domino effect of political setbacks for Democrats  most notably the fate of the health care agenda  that has prompted deep introspection in the Oval Office and across the administration.

When Mr. Obama presents his first State of the Union address on Wednesday evening, aides said he would accept responsibility, though not necessarily blame, for failing to deliver swiftly on some of the changes he promised a year ago. But he will not, aides said, accede to criticism that his priorities are out of step with the nation’s.

As Mr. Obama navigates a crossroads of his presidency, a moment when he signals what lessons he has drawn from his first year in office, the public posture of the White House is that any shortcomings are the result of failing to explain effectively what they were doing  and why. He will acknowledge making mistakes in pursuit of his agenda, aides said, but will not toss the agenda overboard in search of a more popular one.

Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is close to Mr. Obama and many of his advisers, said the notion of the president accepting responsibility would probably be well received by the American people. But with growing strains of populism coming from Washington, he warned against making too drastic of a course correction.

“The American people want to see that you’re going to make a change, but for the president it’s important that he not shift radically because of one election,” Mr. Richardson said in an interview. “He needs to stay the course and not all of the sudden become something that he isn’t. The country was very inspired by Barack Obama  all kinds of voters. He needs to reconnect on that basis.”

On the eve of his speech to a joint session of Congress and a prime-time television audience, Mr. Obama and a small circle of advisers huddled for extended periods on Tuesday, seeking to fine-tune the speech that would serve as a roadmap for the president and his party in a midterm election year.

Still undecided, advisers said, was how much of the address would be devoted to health care as the prospects of finding a lifeline for the legislation seemed to be diminishing. A discussion was under way among the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress whether Mr. Obama would call for a scaled-down version of the legislation that has been the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.

The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, on Tuesday pointed to public opinion polls that showed a strong majority of Americans support many of the specific proposals inside the overall health care plan, but opposed the plan because of the messy legislative process surrounding the bill.

“Obviously the legislation became a caricature of its component parts,” Mr. Gibbs said. “To the degree that’s a communications failing, I think, people here at the White House and others would certainly take responsibility for that.”

The State of the Union address, which is Mr. Obama’s third appearance before a joint session of Congress, offers an opportunity for the president to restate the goals of his administration as he tries to turn the election-year conversation to the economy. The speech will be punctuated with a handful of new ideas  calling for a spending freeze on a portion of the domestic budget  but aides said it would largely be an opportunity for Mr. Obama to return to the proposals that swept him into office.

“Democrats are really looking for that spark again,” said David Young, chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. “We feel like we may be off track and we’re looking for the president to come out with bold initiatives and to lead.”

It remained an open question, though, how Mr. Obama’s initiatives would be received, even among those in his own party, and whether his speech would provide the spark that Democrats like Mr. Young and others are yearning for. His suggestion to place a freeze on some spending  at odds with his views from the presidential campaign  was already being met with skepticism on Tuesday.

The White House has offered a preview of several initiatives in the days leading up to Wednesday, including a series of measures intended to provide financial relief to the middle class.

But advisers to the president said the speech would not contain a laundry list of new programs, suggesting that the message and not the substance would be receiving the largest makeover in an effort to ease the political unrest that has set in across the Democratic Party.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a speech on Tuesday to top party contributors in Washington, dismissed the political worrying among Democrats. He said the loss of the party’s 60-vote supermajority in the Senate could actually have an up side and raise the burden for Republicans “to be accountable as well.”

“The reports of our demise are premature. It’s time that everybody takes a deep breath,” Mr. Biden said. He added, “When we had 60 votes, there was the expectation left, right and center that we could do everything we wanted to do, which was never realistic. Never.”
794 2010-01-27 At 26, Kim Barnes Arico, now the women’s basketball coach at St. John’s, faced a career choice.

She had just attained tenure at Chatham High, in an affluent suburban school district in New Jersey, and was a part-time coach at Fairleigh Dickinson’s campus in Madison. Her father, George, saw the safety in staying put, but Barnes Arico saw a reward in taking a risk. She informed him that she wanted to pursue full-time coaching.

“What are you thinking?” he asked. “You’ve got the greatest job in the world.”

Unconvinced, she accepted an offer to be the head coach of the women’s team at New Jersey Institute of Technology, an N.C.A.A. Division III program making the transition to Division II. In her first league game, in the 1997-98 season, N.J.I.T. lost, 122-27, to St. Rose in Albany. When she called her boyfriend, Larry Arico (pronounced uh-REE-koh), then the football coach at Fairleigh Dickinson, he asked her how the game went.

“We lost by 100,” she said.

“I didn’t believe her,” Arico, now her husband as well as the athletic director and football coach at Marist High in Bayonne, N.J., said Monday.

Back in New Jersey, his team had dropped to 0-10.

“Hers definitely took the cake in that conversation,” Arico said.

A self-made coach who has had head jobs in Divisions I, II and III, Barnes Arico, 39, has St. John’s off to a 16-3 start going into Wednesday’s game at Syracuse. In her eighth season, she has refashioned the Red Storm from a winless outfit against Big East opponents to a trendy program attracting the nation’s No. 11 recruiting class according to HoopGurlz.com.
795 2010-01-27 Britain finally reported positive growth in the final three months of 2009, government data showed Tuesday, after six straight quarters of contraction. The data could signal an end to the recession in Britain.

Gross domestic product grew 0.1 percent from October to December compared with the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said in a preliminary estimate. That was less than the 0.4 percent growth that economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and Reuters had been expecting.

“The weakness was broad-based,” Vicky Redwood, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said. “Most sectors saw pretty flat output.”

The country was the last of the Group of 7 industrialized nations to emerge from recession, behind France and Germany. Spain, which reports its fourth-quarter gross domestic product next month, is alone among major European economies not having commenced recovery.

Ms. Redwood said Britain was behind its Continental neighbors because its households were carrying more debt and because the dire state of public finances ruled out a bigger stimulus package. And the British economy, heavily dependent on the housing market and financial services, was more vulnerable when the credit bubble that had fed those sectors burst.
796 2010-01-27 As incomes rise in the Islamic world and Muslims migrate increasingly to Europe and the United States, Wangen’s halal production is part of a thrust by Nestlé to carve a niche in the global market for halal products, including coffee, baked goods, breakfast cereals and baby food. Halal products now account for $5 billion of Nestlé’s global sales.

But while Switzerland benefits from factories like this one selling its products to Muslim customers in many countries, it appears the Swiss are adamantly opposed to the construction of more minarets like the one down the street.

In some ways, Wangen wears this contradiction on its sleeve. When the Turkish club decided in 2006 to erect the minaret atop its clubhouse, local residents took the association to court to prevent construction, arguing that the minaret violated building codes. The case went to Switzerland’s highest court, which approved construction, though not because the minaret was a form of religious expression. “The court ruled on conformity to the building codes,” said Beat Frey, 50, a regional court judge who is also Wangen’s part-time mayor. “Not on freedom of religion.”

The decision was seized upon by conservative parties, above all the Swiss People’s Party of Christoph Blocher, a right-wing industrialist-turned-politician, who demanded a referendum on the future construction of minarets. Of course, all politics is local, and not just in Massachusetts. The vote in tiny Wangen, population 4,950, many local people said, was not the expression of intolerance it might have seemed.

“There were many reasons, not above all the Muslims among us,” said Mr. Frey, who himself voted in favor of minarets. “Yes, there was fear of political Islam, but people also wanted to send a message to the federal government in Bern,” whose opposition to the amendment was viewed as interference in local affairs.

“There was also fear of the unknown,” he said, adding that about 18 percent of the town’s population is foreign, though the largest group among them are native Germans from nearby.

Down at the Turkish cultural association, Mustafa Karahan, 50, sometimes feels under siege. “The problem is, people don’t know us,” he said over coffee. “If they did, there wouldn’t have been the referendum.”

In 2006, when the club was considering construction of a minaret, members organized an open house, and more than 500 people came. “When we dedicated the minaret, the local Protestant pastor spoke and several government officials came,” said Mr. Karahan, a teacher who migrated to Switzerland in 1980 and works in a machine shop.

But the controversy over the minarets provoked a backlash. As the date for the vote approached, stones were thrown at the clubhouse windows and a bag of pork products was hung on the door. Parking for club members along the nearby railroad was suddenly made off limits by railway officials (and remains so).

“They played politics with us, particularly regarding the minaret, to gain votes,” Mr. Karahan said. “They have damaged Switzerland’s image.”

Mustafa Bakci, 27, a chemist with a Swiss pharmaceuticals company, said the club was open to all nationalities, not just Turks. “Libyans, Saudis — it’s open for everyone,” said Mr. Bakci, who was born in Switzerland. “From A to Z.”

Many foreigners work in the Nestlé plant and at the town’s other big employer, Coop, a Wal-Mart-like retailer. “My sister-in-law works for Nestlé,” Mr. Bakci said.

Walter Leisi, 64, remembers well when in 1962 his father, a baker from Basel, decided to build a factory in Wangen to produce his packaged puff pastry, which had been such a hit at home. “We had three nationalities back then,” he said, recalling the starting work force of about 70 people. “Swiss, Italians and Spaniards.”

In 1972 the factory passed into Nestlé’s hands, but the younger Mr. Leisi, who also voted against the minaret ban, managed it until last year. Now there are 400 employees, about two-thirds non-Swiss. “Many Swiss think it’s not necessary for them to work nights,” he said.

Signs on factory walls are in numerous languages, including Albanian, Serbian, Italian and Turkish. During the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Mr. Leisi said, “I had a bad feeling; would there be knifings here? Down there they were killing each other, yet here we never had a problem.”

Most of the factory’s halal products are exported to France, which has Europe’s largest Muslim population. To meet growing demand, the factory runs three eight-hour shifts a day, Mr. Decker said, sometimes Saturdays.

How does Mr. Leisi explain the resistance to minarets in a town that lives in part by selling food to Muslims?

“The problem is you had a certain category of extremist on one side, and another on the other side,” he said, shaking his head.

Gesturing over his shoulder toward the Turkish club, he added, “One of the reasons, of course, was that little minaret over there.”
797 2010-01-27 The London restaurant may present a kind of British translation of class-free American culture: a democracy of fame. But the American retranslation of that conceit falls flat. At Le Caprice New York, there’s no lurching about with actors. There’s just a senior vice president having drinks and a salad, then checking the Nikkei before bed.

Even to have that meal, however, requires some work. Le Caprice belongs to Richard Caring, a tycoon in the British clothing business who has been building a portfolio of restaurants and clubs since the mid-2000s. (He has the Ivy in the West End as well, along with the esteemed fish house J. Sheekey, also there, and stakes in over a half-dozen more.)

Of his first venture in the United States, he told The New York Times last September, “I want buzz.” And so he has held back tables at the restaurant. Many of them. Despite a dining room that is not precisely crowded with patrons, reservations at Le Caprice are difficult to get.

Those taking advantage of online booking systems will discover that the restaurant generally allows customers tables only before 6 p.m. or after 10 p.m. Telephone calls, meanwhile, can lead to holding patterns that rival those of the cable company. A walk-in diner may be told, despite the sparse crowd in attendance, that there is an hour’s wait for a table, and that seats at the bar are “for reservations only.”

If you persevere — the best way to do this is to stay on the telephone, to ask again and again if there isn’t, please, some way to squeeze you in at 7 or 7:30 — you may succeed in securing a table at a decent hour. After all, they do need someone in the room.

Le Caprice has its charms. It is sleek, almost deco, like the interior of an imaginary ocean liner or a movie set for one of Fred Astaire’s RKO films. It sees its apogee mostly in the form of David Bailey’s photographs of the young Jean Shrimpton, which line the walls with innocence and desire.

There are a few good things to eat. The smoked haddock tart, for instance: rich with egg and the smoky perfection of haddock blended with potato, a rarity in the United States that is worth traveling some distance to try.

The béarnaise sauce that accompanies the New York strip steak is copious and addictive, excellent with crisp and golden French fries, themselves salty and delicious enough to set the mayor’s finger wagging. These two make a tremendous pair.

Crisp duck and watercress, meanwhile, is Peking duck niblets served over bitter greens, essentially. That is either up your alley or not. Chicken alla Milanese is fried chicken from under a steamroller, and with a splash of lemon is perfectly edible. The fish and chips, served with sweet minted peas and a pungent tartar sauce, aren’t bad at all.

But boy, the chopped steak sure is: awful gray, flavorless patties of the sort known in the New York City public schools as murder burgers (best with suicide fries). These are accompanied by a tomato relish of no particular distinction. The dish costs $24. It’s worth none of them.

Similarly lame is an appetizer of foie gras served with caramelized apples — a poorly trimmed and simultaneously overseared and undercooked hunk of liver that might have come out of a particularly bibulous duck. The sweet apples served with it are of little help.

Bang bang chicken is an English interpretation of Sichuan cooking: cold chicken breast shredded into a spicy peanut butter sauce, with some julienned vegetables. Served by Nigella Lawson in a cottage in the Cotswolds before an afternoon of bed rest and reading, it might record high marks. At a table at the end of a narrow room on 61st Street, it’s just comfort food for rickshaw riders. Too sweet, too gooey, too cold — it fails to impress.

Salmon fishcakes are bland and more warm than hot; they taste of cafeteria eating and boarding-school shame. A venison loin reminds us what’s been lost in the farming of animals we once ate only when harvested wild. It’s almost flavorless and, in this, an appropriate partner for a wee grilled veal chop with something that appeared to look like, if not taste of, chanterelles.

Enough! There is a credible sticky toffee pudding for dessert, heightened with bananas, and a plausible chocolate pudding soufflé. The staff is perfectly pleasant in an affectless, professional British manner.

You can have a fair evening at Le Caprice if you end up there on business, smiling tight in your chair at a client or boss, and stick to steak and those fries. You can do the same if you want to head on over early and have a martini, try out the haddock tart at the bar. Anglophilia is like that. Hear the accent, and we just can’t stop ourselves.

SOUND LEVEL Tinkly piano up front, but you can hear yourself think.

798 2010-01-27 Bob Dylan; Jennifer Hudson, near right; and Smokey Robinson, far right, are among the artists who will participate in the White House’s first music event of 2010, according to a news release on Tuesday. The concert, “In Performance at the White House: A Celebration of Music From the Civil Rights Movement,” will be held on Feb. 11 in the State Dining Room, and is timed to celebrate Black History Month. Other performers on the bill include Natalie Cole, John Legend, John Mellencamp, Seal, the Blind Boys of Alabama and the Howard University Choir. It will be hosted by Morgan Freeman and Queen Latifah. The concert is the latest event in a music series started last year by Michelle Obama, and will be broadcast on public television and streamed live online at whitehouse.gov.
799 2010-01-27 BEIJING — Asian markets sagged Tuesday amid concerns that China was reining in credit and might raise interest rates to curb rising inflation.

Investors apparently feared that China’s recent efforts to limit easy credit would be followed by tighter lending policies as the government tried to restrain speculation in the nation’s fast-growing economy.

The Shanghai Composite Index, China’s leading index, fell 2.4 percent, or 75.02 points, closing at 3,019.39, the lowest point since Oct. 30. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, MSCI Asia Pacific and Japan’s Nikkei also fell. Bloomberg News reported it was the seventh consecutive day of losses and the longest market retreat in two years for Asian stocks.

“The bottom line is the Chinese government has become a little concerned about the degree of frothiness in the real economy,” said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell and former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division.

“The markets sense that a lot more lending restrictions are likely — directly in terms of quantity of credit going out from banks or through additional tightening measures such as increases in interest rates or reserve requirements,” he said.
800 2010-01-27 This time, persuaded of broad voter furor, Mr. Tasini believes he has a legitimate chance, with his progressive views and a résumé of never having held political office. Provided, that is, he can assemble much more money — he’s thinking $1 million to $10 million. If he does, he actually feels he will not only win, but also, it will not be close.

Sometimes long shots need to think that way.

Right now, he appreciates that most people do not even know he is running. He declared his candidacy in June.

It might have been more pleasurable going alone against Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, no powerhouse on the order of Mrs. Clinton. But this month Harold E. Ford Jr., the Tennessee transplant, began floating his candidacy. With two names now in the headlines, well, it can get lonely being the long shot.

When a Marist poll on the race came out this month, the results were Ms. Gillibrand, 43 percent; Mr. Ford 24 percent; undecided 33 percent. Mr. Tasini was not even a choice.

He pointed out that the poll demonstrated that most people did not support the senator and a quarter supported someone who had not yet joined the race. Made him feel the nomination could be his.

When the Massachusetts Senate race unexpectedly went Republican a week ago, Mr. Tasini interpreted it as voter contempt for insiders.

“People who say the long shot, they lack imagination,” he said. “My question back to them is when will be enough? When will be enough not to vote for these insiders?”

He is 53 and single, with frameless glasses and thinning dark hair practically ironed to his head.

Views: He is against the health care bill, and wants Medicare for all. He is against the dual wars (“I will not vote for a single penny to continue either war”). He wants to increase the minimum wage immediately to $10 an hour and see it quickly reach $15 to $20. He wants a stronger labor movement. (“People say you’re antibusiness. I’m pro-business because I want jobs. What I’m against is foolishness.”) He wants a tax on every transaction on Wall Street. He supports gay marriage and gun control.

As for Ms. Gillibrand, he said: “She has brought no vision for the country. If you want someone to tinker around the edges, you should vote for her.”

Some people who know him think he is dauntless. Some think he is a self-promoter. Some don’t know what to think.

Tim Carpenter, the national director of Progressive Democrats of America, said, “His message is already resonating with the progressive community.”

Ed Ott, who teaches about labor issues at the City University of New York’s Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies, said: “The money is too intimidating. He’s got too tall a mountain to climb.”

Mr. Tasini’s father was from the British-ruled Palestine Mandate and became an electrical engineer. His mother was born in Poland and is a psychiatrist. Mr. Tasini was born in Houston, lived in cities and towns throughout New York and in Israel, got a degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, then devoted himself to the labor movement.

For a long time, he led the National Writers Union. He successfully sued The New York Times and other publishers on behalf of freelance writers. For the last three years, he has been the executive director of the Labor Research Association, a union strategy group.

Mr. Tasini met for lunch recently at the trendy Odeon in TriBeCa with Philip DePaolo, director of the New York Community Council, an advocacy group, and Michael D. D. White, a real estate lawyer and urban planner.

The long shot pitched himself: “We are at a watershed moment.”

Mr. DePaolo said he thought he could win.

Mr. Tasini doesn’t own a car. His apartment in Washington Heights rents for less than $1,000. He rides a bike and the subway.

One of his few indulgences is season tickets to the Yankees — grandstand level.

He asked the two men, “Am I going to lose a lot of votes on the Yankees thing?”

Mr. DePaolo: “I’ve been boycotting the new stadium.”

Mr. Tasini: “I think this may be the toughest thing to overcome of the vision stuff.”

Mr. Tasini headed to Staten Island. With an entourage numbering one, he rode the ferry — New York’s free ride — silhouetted against the city’s twinkling lights. When Harold Ford traveled there once, he took a helicopter.

An evening fund-raiser awaited at the St. George Parish Grill. The suggested contribution was $50. About 35 people showed up, hors d’oeuvres circling the room.

He spoke to a recently unemployed chef. Mr. Tasini told him he wanted to learn to really cook.

He spoke to a production person from the television show “Mercy” who wanted to know where he was on animal rights. Mr. Tasini said he used to have a cat, but it died, and he’s all for animal rights.

He told the crowd: “They’re giving out bonuses on Wall Street as if nothing has happened. It’s the modern-day version of Marie Antoinette: let them eat cake.”

He talked some more. The night wore on. He grabbed some food. Long shots eat, too.
801 2010-01-27 A pause is certainly better than a plunge, which is what was happening during 2007 and 2008. But sales have slowed markedly since November. It is only a matter of time, the analysts say, before prices also undergo at least a slight dip.

“We expect home price deflation to resume in the December or January Case-Shiller indices and continue through 2010,” Zelman & Associates wrote in a research note.

The 20-city Case-Shiller composite price index is down 29.2 percent from its peak in the second quarter of 2006 and 5.3 percent over the last year. Average home prices are where they were in late 2003.

Prices in five of the cities fell in November from the previous month, while 15 rose. Las Vegas managed to snap its long losing streak and eke out a 0.1 percent gain. The strongest cities were on the West Coast, including San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. The five that fell included Chicago, Miami and New York.

The West Coast Case-Shiller numbers were backed up by the Federal Housing Finance Agency data, which showed that the Pacific was the strongest of nine United States regions both for the month and the last year.

Nothing is simple about real estate these days, however. Jim Klinge, an agent in northern San Diego who keeps a close watch on sales trends, recently published on his blog comparative statistics for the first 15 days of January going back 12 years.

There were 61 closed deals in the two weeks this year, which places 2010 roughly between the 1999 peak of 125 and the 2008 nadir of 36. But the price buyers are paying per square foot — one of the most accurate measures of pricing trends — is still falling. Last year it was $410 a foot; this year, it is $368.

The local market “is blazingly hot,” Mr. Klinge said, but only for sellers who want to get rid of their place, quickly.

“These sellers feel like they’re giving the house away, which is what buyers want,” he said. “If the sellers price the house too high, no one will even look at it.”

The only sellers who can do this, of course, are ones willing and able to take a big loss. Mr. Klinge showed a house Tuesday that was for sale for $800,000. The owners had paid $975,000 a few years ago, so they will lose nearly all their down payment. “It was a second home, and they just wanted to be rid of it,” the agent said.

Seasonal adjustments are affecting the numbers in San Diego and everywhere else. These have the effect of smoothing out swings in the raw numbers. On an unadjusted basis, the individual cities in the Case-Shiller index fared worse: 13 fell, while the composite price index dropped 0.2 percent.

The Conference Board’s monthly measure of consumer confidence, also released Tuesday, rose to 55.9 in January from a revised 53.6 in December. That was more of an improvement than analysts had expected but still low by historical standards.

Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist with Miller Tabak, said that the long-term average was about 95, and that the high reading was 144 early in 2000. “Clearly more work on the confidence front needs to be done,” he said.
802 2010-01-27 Verizon reported a fourth-quarter loss of $653 million on Tuesday, mostly because of costs related to layoffs, despite a 10 percent increase in revenue.

The company also said it planned to cut an additional 13,000 jobs this year.

The company said it added 2.2 million wireless subscribers in the quarter, up substantially from the 1.2 million added a year earlier.

The quarterly loss came to 23 cents a share and contrasted with a profit of $1.24 billion, or 43 cents a share a year earlier. It took a charge of $3 billion, or 66 cents a share, related to severance expenses in the quarter.

Revenue rose to $27.1 billion, from $24.65 billion in the period a year earlier, much of it because of the acquisition of the Alltel Corporation. Still, the results fell short of Wall Street expectations. “Like all U.S. carriers, Verizon has felt the impact of the macro environment in 2009,” wrote Julien Blin, an independent analyst who keeps a keen eye on the wireless industry, in a note to clients Tuesday. “However, we should start to see signs of recovery in 2010.”

During a call to investors and analysts on Tuesday, Verizon’s chief financial officer, John Killian, said the company would continue to trim costs to combat the deterioration of its residential wireline phone business and its corporate business that is still recovering from the recession. Over the last two years, the company eliminated 26,000 jobs in its wireline sector. Verizon employs about 223,000 people.
803 2010-01-27 When the panel discussed a generalized ban on wearing the full veil in public, the talk was dominated by criticism from legal experts, Muslim leaders and the police.

Further, the Interior Ministry says only a small fraction of France’s Muslim women wear the full veil — 1,900 — so a broader ban would mostly affect wealthy tourists from and other Persian Gulf nations, who help keep up the retail economy here. According to the police, most of the 1,900 are young, two-thirds are French citizens and a quarter are Muslim converts.

The center-right government of President has been deeply concerned about the rise of Salafism, a more conservative form of Islam, especially among converts.

Mr. Sarkozy has said that the veil is “not welcome in France because it is contrary to our values and contrary to the ideals we have of a woman’s dignity.” But he stepped back from pushing the broader ban, concerned about its constitutionality and the possible offense of Muslims.

Instead, with an eye on the coming regional elections, he and his prime minister, , said Parliament should debate the issue and vote on a nonbinding resolution before trying to pass legislation.

Those who oppose the veil call it a symbol of the repression of women, but many of those who wear it say that they do so voluntarily as an expression of their faith. Their backers say that a ban would deny Muslim women freedom of expression and stigmatize them.

The whole discussion has made many Muslims uncomfortable or angry. Muhammad Moussaoui, the head of a national coalition of Muslim organizations, told The Associated Press that “it’s very difficult to talk about the liberation of women through a law that constrains.” But in some public accommodations, “where identification is necessary,” he said, it was legitimate to ask women to show their faces.

Muslim veiling. varies. The full veil, which can hide the eyes or leave them exposed, is popularly referred to as a , after the Afghan garment that covers face and body and leaves a mesh panel over the eyes.

Guy Geoffroy, a legislator from Mr. Sarkozy’s party, said he favored a clear statement that “the burqa is contrary to a woman’s rights, contrary to public order and security.” But he said a law should be limited and applicable. “The worst thing is a law of significant ambition, and even as we vote for it we know we won’t have the means to put it in place.”

Various polls show that a varying majority of French, when asked, favor a ban on the full veil. And the French media have had great fun with the topic. For instance, the popular daily newspaper Parisien this week interviewed a French artist who said that she had worn the full veil for a month “in hell,” and that she sweated profusely in the summer and got drenched in the rain because the black cloth acted like a sponge.

But it is difficult to tell how much the French really care about the whole debate. On Monday night, Mr. Sarkozy had a prime-time, two-hour television program in which he answered questions from 11 citizens with a variety of concerns and grievances. Mr. Sarkozy, who is masterly at this kind of theater, was asked about the ongoing government-inspired “debate” about national identity. He responded by soothingly talking of the need for families to discuss all issues. The veil did not even come up.

814 2010-01-28 There's no reason you couldn't use it to make calls using Skype, of course -- Apple says that virtually all of the existing 140,000 iPhone apps run fine on the iPad. (You can run them either at regular tiny size, or blown up double with some loss of clarity.)

Then again, you might look a little bizarre walking through the airport holding this giant clipboard up to your ear.

Until I saw the demo, I wondered why you'd want an iPad instead of a laptop. After all, the price is about the same. And once you add a carrying case to the iPad -- wouldn't you worry about that glass screen bouncing around in your briefcase or backpack naked? -- it's about the same bulk and weight as a laptop.

Now, though, it looks like Apple really has created something new. Criticisms of "Like a laptop" and "a big iPod Touch" don't really do justice to the possibilities.

The iPad as an e-book reader is a no-brainer. It's just infinitely better-looking and more responsive than the Kindle, not to mention it has color and doesn't require external illumination. (Book fans should note, however, that the iPad e-bookstore won't offer bestsellers at $10 each, like Amazon and Barnes & Noble do. And although Apple says the iPad has a 10-hour battery life, it hasn't yet said "doing what." Playing video eats up battery a lot faster than reading e-books.)

Web browsing, painting programs, TV and movies, newspapers and magazines all seem like naturals on this 1.5-pound machine, too. The New York Times app is especially appealing to me -- and yes, this is my completely independent opinion -- because it seems to work like the much-adored Times Reader app for computers.

Overall, the iPad seems like a dream screen for reading and watching--at some loss of convenience in creating. True, there's an on-screen keyboard, big enough to type on with both hands in the usual way. And Apple will offer a specialized multitouch word processor, spreadsheet and presentation app for $10 each. But I'm guessing that, with no mouse and no physical keys to feel, writing and editing will be more effort than on a laptop. (Apple will also sell an external keyboard that holds the iPad upright as you type. Then again, if you need to carry all that around, maybe a laptop would make more sense.)

But these are just the wild speculations of a guy who's never even tried the thing. (Believe me, I'll review it when I get one.)

My main message to fanboys is this: it's too early to draw any conclusions. Apple hasn't given the thing to any reviewers yet, there are no iPad-only apps yet (there will be), the e-bookstore hasn't gone online yet, and so on. So hyperventilating is not yet the appropriate reaction.

At the same time, the bashers should be careful, too. As we enter Phase 2, remember how silly you all looked when you all predicted the iPhone's demise in that period before it went on sale.

Like the iPhone, the iPad is really a vessel, a tool, a 1.5-pound sack of potential. It may become many things. It may change an industry or two, or it may not. It may introduce a new category -- something between phone and laptop -- or it may not. And anyone who claims to know what will happen will wind up looking like a fool.

824 2010-01-28 Internet voting is in its infancy, and still far too unreliable, but states are starting to allow it and the trend is accelerating because of a new federal law that requires greater efforts to help military and other overseas voters cast ballots. Men and women in uniform must have a fair opportunity to vote, but allowing online voting in its current state could open elections up to vote theft and other mischief.

It is often hard for military voters to get ballots, and because of distance and unreliable mail service, it can be difficult or impossible for them to meet election deadlines. A year ago, the Pew Center on the States found that more than one-third of states do not provide military voters stationed abroad with enough time to vote, or are at high risk of not providing enough time. To address this problem, the new Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act requires states in most cases to get ballots to military and overseas voters well in advance of regularly scheduled federal elections.

But the value of removing roadblocks is undermined when votes are put at risk, which can happen when ballots are returned by e-mail or are actually cast on a Web site. Massachusetts recently enacted a law allowing service members to vote by e-mail overseas. According to Verified Voting, a group that works to ensure reliable elections, 16 states allow some form of Internet voting, and more than a dozen — including Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois and Washington — are considering it.

E-mail can be intercepted, and voting Web sites can be hacked or taken down by malicious attacks. There are not even agreed-upon standards for what safety measures are necessary.

In many cases, it is not possible to ensure a secret ballot when votes are cast online or by e-mail. That is a particular concern for military voting, where soldiers could come under pressure from commanding officers about their choice of a candidate.

The Internet can help improve overseas voting if it is used wisely. It can be a good way to get information about elections and candidates out to faraway voters, and to deliver blank ballots. Right now, those ballots should not be returned online.
825 2010-01-28 Many historians contend that Pius XII did not do enough to save Jews during the Holocaust. The Vatican has long said that Pius, who was pope from 1939 to 1958, helped save many Jews who were hidden in Roman Catholic churches, monasteries and convents.

Natalia Indrimi, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event and director of the New York office of Centro Primo Levi, a group dedicated to the history of Italian Jews, said the question of Pius’s role during the Holocaust would be settled only when all papal records of the wartime period were unsealed by the Vatican, which so far has released only some.

“It is up to the church to make its own decisions about canonization,” she said. “But any claim that Pius did something or didn’t do something is only a claim until all the records can be studied by the historians.”

The reading of the names took all day. Public officials, clergy members, prominent citizens and scholars came, stood before a bank of four microphones, read about 20 names each, then left.

In the morning, Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio of Brooklyn stood next to Matilda Cuomo, the wife of the ex-governor, reading names. In the afternoon, there were ambassadors and businessmen.

Rabbi Avi Weiss, an outspoken leader in the Orthodox Jewish community and director of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, in the Bronx, was on the list of people scheduled to read, but did not show up because the consulate had apparently forgotten to invite him.

“They called me this morning and apologized,” Rabbi Weiss said by telephone later in the day.

“It was a mix-up,” said Maurizio Antonini, the deputy consul general.

For the record, Rabbi Weiss said that if he had been there, “I think I would have found it impossible to remember those mercilessly killed without raising my voice in protest against plans to beatify Pius XII, a world leader who could have raised his voice and did not.”

Past the consulate on Park Avenue and 69th Street went delivery workers, well-dressed people, beautifully coiffed dogs and their walkers, a few passers-by who stopped to read some names, according to the consulate, and quite a few more who just stopped and stared.

“Are these all different people, or are they repeating names?” asked Debbie O’Connor of Hannacroix in Greene County, N.Y., who was at the consulate to help her daughter, Katie, 20, get her student visa for a semester in Milan, starting next month.

She was halted at the curb by the steady roll call of mellifluous Italian names — “Cantoni, Allessandra; Cantoni, Amelia; Cantoni, Carlotta; Cantoni, Ida; Cantoni, Luciano” — most of them clustered in family groups of 5 or 10.

When told they were all different people, she put her hand to her mouth. “Oh, my God,” she said.
826 2010-01-28 That means that a child in custody is about twice as likely to be raped as an adult behind bars, based on similar surveys of adult prisoners. As The New York Review of Books wrote on its blog, we face a “crisis of juvenile prison rape.”

The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, a blue-ribbon panel that issued its final report last year, described how a 14-year-old boy weighing 98 pounds was assaulted after he was made to share a cell with two older teenagers. Both were 6 feet 2 inches, and one weighed 160 pounds and the other 195 pounds.

Surprisingly, the new survey suggests that the biggest predators are not other inmates but prison staff — and female staff members offend as much as the males do. More than 10 percent of boys in juvenile correctional facilities said that they had had sex with staff, most of whom were women.

Among girls, almost 5 percent said that they had engaged in sexual activity with staff, most of whom were men.

Reggie Walton, a federal judge in the who led the prison rape commission, said that the figures may even be an undercount because of the stigma of rape. “I was shocked at the level of abuse,” he said.

One lesson from the surveys is that we should rethink the way male guards are sometimes assigned to female inmates, and female guards to male inmates, without sufficient respect for inmates’ privacy or dignity. That won’t stop same-sex violence or inmate-on-inmate abuses, but it would address one important component of the abuse problem.

By some accounts, the majority of guards at women’s prisons are now men. Investigators at one juvenile correctional facility found that a male guard watched as girls showered, while a woman watched over boys showering.

Jamie Fellner of Human Rights Watch, also a member of the prison rape commission, described a prison where men were stripped naked and asked to spread their buttocks in front of a female officer. When a male inmate asked to be searched in front of a man instead, Ms. Fellner said he was Tasered.

In the last few years, a growing number of states have limited the ability of guards to strip-search members of the opposite sex or watch them showering. And a landmark law, the Prison Rape Elimination Act, created Judge Walton’s commission, which has made excellent recommendations to reduce violence and abuse behind bars. The Obama administration should quickly implement those recommendations.

Surveys have found that well-managed prisons and correctional facilities with strong accountability have almost no rape, by guards or inmates. Others have astonishingly high levels. If we want to rehabilitate young offenders and help them get their lives in order, a starting point is to end the criminal abuse of them.

The legacy of Rodney Hulin Jr. should be a concerted drive to end the way inmates are raped with impunity behind bars. The survey results indicating the ubiquity of sexual assault behind bars, often by guards, should be an awakening — and an end to this blind spot that so many of us have shown. We need to be as alert to human rights abuses in our youth correctional facilities as to those at Guantánamo.
827 2010-01-28 HONG KONG — Shares in Rusal, the aluminum giant controlled by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska, plunged nearly 11 percent Wednesday in their trading debut in Hong Kong, weighed down by global markets’ recent slump.

Rusal raised $2.2 billion in the initial public offering last week, making it the largest in many months in Hong Kong. The I.P.O., the first on the exchange this year, is also the first primary listing there for a company from outside Asia. Hong Kong emerged as one of the biggest venues for initial offerings last year, largely reflecting a flurry of listings from Chinese companies.

A number of Russian companies, particularly those operating near China in Siberia, or selling commodities across the border, are eager to follow Rusal’s lead and tap Chinese capital markets. These include the Russian state railroad, which operates the only rail line from the Far East to Europe.

Russian companies say they believe that Chinese investors are eager to invest in Russian mines and oil companies but have been reluctant to put money into the sometimes murky Russian stock exchanges. That is attracting to Hong Kong the Russian companies that might previously have sought to list in London or New York. China last year surpassed Germany as Russia’s largest trading partner.

Rusal, caught up in tortuous debt-restructuring negotiations last year that were among the most extensive in Russian history, eventually was approved for a listing after regulatory hold-ups pushed the timing into 2010.
828 2010-01-28 Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit fell as demand remained weak but that it expected sales to rebound in 2010 as the economy improved and dealers replaced inventory.

Leading the way will be China and other developing countries, where an increasing share of the company’s machinery is sold.

Caterpillar said its profit last quarter fell 65 percent, to $232 million, or 36 cents a share, from $661 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 39 percent, to $7.9 billion, from $12.92 billion.

Though sales will probably pick up next year, Caterpillar’s profit estimate for the year, about $2.50 a share, fell short of what many analysts had expected.

Stock in Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., fell $2.41, or 4.3 percent, to $53.44 a share.

Mike DeWalt, the company’s director of investor relations, said he thought Wall Street overestimated Caterpillar’s earnings capability after the company said in October that it expected revenue to climb 10 to 25 percent in 2010.

“They got a little ahead of expectations because we weren’t able to provide them profit guidance in the third quarter,” Mr. DeWalt said.
829 2010-01-28 The McClatchy Company, publisher of The Miami Herald and 29 other daily newspapers, posted a quarterly profit on Wednesday, reversing a year-earlier loss, and announced a plan that will extend a deadline for debt payments, prompting a 12 percent gain in its share price.

McClatchy, which also publishes The Sacramento Bee and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, said its fourth-quarter results were helped by an improving advertising climate, particularly for its Web sites.

The chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said McClatchy ended the year “on a positive note,” citing brighter advertising trends in October, November and December. He said even classified advertising looked better.

Still, McClatchy’s results also showed the pressure the industry is under. Revenue fell 16.5 percent from a year earlier to $393.2 million. And while the rate of decline in advertising sales slowed, the figure was nonetheless down 20.5 percent, to $308.7 million.

Mr. Pruitt said that in the last few weeks, “ad revenues are down in the low-to-mid teens percentage range,” a level he said was consistent with what sales should ordinarily be for the entire first quarter.

“Given that total ad revenues are still negative and secular challenges remain, we will continue to focus on costs,” Mr. Pruitt said in a statement. Expenses in the first quarter should be down in the “low 20 percent range,” he said.
830 2010-01-28 American newspapers have relied on government subsidies since Washington’s day, but that support has dropped sharply in the last four decades, according to a report to be released Thursday by the University of Southern California.

In the last year, the industry’s financial woes have prompted much debate about what government can do to support the news media — and much hand-wringing about the risk of journalists being beholden to government.

But the authors of the new study say government support is nothing new, though even many journalists are unaware of it.

“We think it’s important for people to understand that the government has been involved from the beginning, and that the subsidies were much larger in the past,” said Geoffrey Cowan, dean emeritus of the university’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

He and his co-author, David Westphal, the school’s executive in residence, said that in today’s dollars, government support for newspapers and magazines had fallen to less than $2 billion from more than $4 billion in 1970.
831 2010-01-28 A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved a $45.6 million incentive program for top executives and managers of the Tribune Company, overruling objections by a union and the bankruptcy trustee that the payout was too high and unwarranted.

The program for 2009 covers 10 top executives and 710 managers. Kevin J. Carey, the chief judge of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, did not rule on two other incentive programs for 20 top executives that totaled about $20 million. In remarks before issuing his ruling, he suggested that the Tribune board consider rolling the remaining incentive plans into the reorganization plan under which the company would emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

The bonuses amount to about 11 percent of the company’s 2009 operating cash flow of $500 million. William Salganik of the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, which represents employees at The Baltimore Sun, a Tribune property, called the bonuses “unprecedented” compared with the previous high payout of 3.3 percent during a 12-year period. “It’s a greater reward for lower performance,” Mr. Salganik said, noting that the 2007 cash flow had been $1.2 billion.

He said the Tribune had laid off or bought out about 3,000 employees companywide.

In court papers, the bankruptcy trustee, Roberta A. DeAngelis, disputed Tribune’s claim that the incentive programs were bona fide awards “based on real performance targets that are intended to motivate superior performance.” She said Tribune officials failed to “back up their characterization” that cash flow targets were real and had failed to provide records of actual versus projected performance.

But in a 10-minute ruling from the bench, Judge Carey said he found the proposed bonuses were justified because “there is a reasonable relationship between the plan and its objective to restore profitability and let the company move forward.”

“The plan,” he said, “was developed over time by and among all the major constituents of the company and has their support.” He explained that the incentive was intended for the unsecured creditors and to “put more money in their pockets.”
832 2010-01-28 WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday for the first time that public companies should warn investors of any serious risks that global warming might pose to their businesses.

Although the agency has long required companies to reveal possible financial or legal impacts from a variety of environmental challenges, it has never specifically cited climate change as bringing potentially significant business risks or rewards.

The S.E.C., on a party-line 3-2 vote, issued “interpretive guidance” to help companies decide when and whether to disclose matters related to climate change. The commission said that companies could be helped or hurt by climate-related lawsuits, business opportunities or legislation and should promptly disclose such potential impacts. Banks or insurance companies that invest in coastal property that could be affected by storms or rising seas, for example, should disclose such risks, the agency said.

Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, who was appointed by President Obama, said that the commission was not creating new legal requirements for companies, nor did it intend to endorse any particular scientific or policy view of global warming. She said that including climate risks among other disclosures was a logical step.

“It is neither surprising nor especially remarkable for us to conclude that of course a company must consider whether potential legislation — whether that legislation concerns climate change or new licensing requirements — is likely to occur,” Ms. Schapiro said in her opening statement before Wednesday’s vote. “Similarly, a company must disclose the significant risks that it faces, whether those risks are due to increased competition or severe weather. These principles of materiality form the bedrock of our disclosure framework.”
833 2010-01-28 Arenas, who was the face of the Wizards franchise, will lose about $7.4 million of his $16.2 million salary during the suspension. Crittenton, a backup guard in the third year of his rookie deal, which paid $1.5 million this season, will lose about $510,000.

Stern issued the suspensions after meeting for about an hour with each of the players, Crittenton on Tuesday and Arenas on Wednesday.

Arenas is also facing a possible jail sentence after pleading guilty to a felony gun charge — carrying an unlicensed pistol. (He had a previous charge, a misdemeanor for illegal gun possession in California in 2003.) Crittenton was sentenced this week to a year of unsupervised probation for misdemeanor gun possession.

“They expressed their contrition and their determination to make it right to the greatest extent they possibly can,” Stern said, “and the recognition over all about the size of what they had done wrong.”

He added, “I accept fully their expressions of regret.”

Only Indiana’s Ron Artest (73 games) and Golden State’s Latrell Sprewell (68 games) have served longer suspensions in the N.B.A. Artest was punished for instigating a player-fan brawl during a game at the Palace of Auburn Hills in 2004. Sprewell was suspended for choking his coach, P. J. Carlesimo, in 1997.

There was no precedent for Stern to follow in this case. Other N.B.A. players have run afoul of the law for gun possession or gun use, but no one had been punished for violating the league’s ban on firearms on team property.

Arenas and Crittenton were essentially disciplined for the same offense. The difference in suspensions stems from an earlier decision by Stern to suspend Arenas indefinitely for repeatedly mocking the incident — most notably on Jan. 5, when Arenas pantomimed gun use with his fingers during a pregame huddle. Stern, who usually waits for the legal process to conclude before disciplining players, suspended Arenas the next day.

Had Stern not acted then, Arenas and Crittenton would have faced uniform suspensions for the rest of the season.

Crittenton is weighing whether to file an appeal through the National Basketball Players Association. Arenas has asked the union not to appeal his suspension.

“Gilbert and Javaris are both good men and respected members of our union,” Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said in a statement. “They recognize that they exercised poor judgment the morning of Dec. 21 at the Verizon Center, and realize that they must be held accountable for their actions. Neither of them wants to send a mixed message about firearms.”

Still unresolved is whether the Wizards will try to void Arenas’s contract, which has four years and $80.2 million remaining after this season. Stern said he had not advised the team on the matter.

Hunter indicated that the union would fight such an action, saying, “We will respond aggressively to any improper attempt by the team to impose additional penalties.”

Crittenton has not played this season because of a foot injury he sustained over the summer.

The conflict between Arenas, 28, and Crittenton, 22, began on a team flight on Dec. 19, when the two argued over a gambling debt. Each player threatened to shoot the other, according to prosecutors in the case. Arenas has claimed he made his remarks in jest.

The dispute continued two days later, when Arenas laid out four guns on a chair in front of Crittenton’s locker at the at the Verizon Center, with a note that said, “Pick 1.” Crittenton, according to investigators, threw one of the guns on the floor, then pulled his own gun out of a backpack. The authorities have concluded that none of the guns were loaded and that Crittenton did not use his in a threatening matter

Stern reserved his harshest words for Arenas, a three-time All-Star and onetime media darling who until now had been known as a playful, harmless eccentric. Stern was outraged by Arenas’s behavior in the days after news reports about the locker-room incident.

“I felt that I should do something to keep Gilbert from doing even further damage to himself,” Stern said. “And I told him that.”

The Wizards (14-30) were struggling on the court even before the incident and have been further burdened by the continuing distraction of a federal investigation and increased news media scrutiny. A number of players and team personnel were interviewed by the authorities.

Washington’s next game will be against the Nets in New Jersey on Friday night.

In a statement, Wizards officials said they “understand and fully support” Stern’s decision.
834 2010-01-28 I.R.S. officials said Wednesday that Switzerland needed to hew to the August deal. “We expect the Swiss government to continue to honor the terms of the agreement,” the agency said in a statement. The Justice Department declined to comment.

“The Swiss right now need to do their Swiss thing — they’re trying to find a creative way to get this thing done,” said a top American government official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter.

“Even in the light of the Swiss Administrative Court’s ruling, we will try to comply with the provisions of the treaty,” Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss justice minister, said after a meeting of the Swiss cabinet.

The Swiss cabinet said it was not contesting Switzerland’s disclosure of 250 names to the Justice Department in February. That move was part of a deal that helped UBS avoid indictment and instead pay a $780 million fine and admit to criminal wrongdoing with its offshore private banking services sold to Americans.

“An exchange of information with the U.S. authorities is only possible in about 250 cases,” the cabinet said. Finma, the Swiss regulatory agency, said in February that not turning over the 250 names could have harmed UBS and the global economy.

The Swiss did not explain how the disclosure of the 250 names was not deemed to be a breach of Swiss privacy laws while disclosure of the 4,450 was.

At issue is what Cono Namorato, a partner at the Washington law firm Caplin & Drysdale, said was “a very, very different definition of fraud” by the Swiss — one that distinguishes between tax evasion, or simply not paying taxes, which is not regarded as a crime, and tax fraud, which is regarded as a crime but involves ill-gotten gains from activities like money laundering or the deliberate falsification of documents.

Kevin E. Packman, a tax lawyer at Holland & Knight in Miami, said that the Swiss courts “have put UBS and, to some extent, the Swiss government in an uncomfortable position. I suspect that if the courts don’t cooperate with the government to find a solution, things are going to get really ugly for UBS.”

In a statement, UBS said that it “welcomes the fact that the Swiss Federal Council is pursuing a dialogue with the U.S. authorities.”

“UBS’s new management will fully support the search for a solution,” it added. “As before, we will fulfill all our commitments under the agreement.”

Peter J. Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit and a former Justice Department criminal fraud investigator, said that with the original August deal, “the Swiss tried to pull a fast one on their own country. They really haven’t changed their underlying bank secrecy laws, and their courts, and now their government, are saying, ‘You can’t just do that.’ The Swiss government is in a really bad situation. They have to confront the issue of bank secrecy — what do they want, what are they willing to live with.”
835 2010-01-28 But hundreds of Haitians like Ms. Guerrier-Cavalier, who were allowed to come here after the earthquake as escorts for American citizens who are minors, are not eligible for that status.

They also are not eligible for a status known as humanitarian parole, which would allow them to apply for permission to work, and to renew their status in one-year increments. Some Haitian orphans were granted that status, allowing them to come here before their adoption paperwork was finished.

Federal officials said they had realized their mistake and, last weekend, began to give incoming parents humanitarian parole instead of tourist visas. But at least one mother who arrived on Sunday had only a tourist visa, said Gepsie Metellus, the director of Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center in Miami. And the change came too late for Ms. Guerrier-Cavalier, and others like her. Humanitarian parole cannot be given to someone already in the United States.

In the aftermath of the earthquake, temporary protected status was made available only to Haitians already in the United States because officials were seeking to deter Haitians from trying to get to the United States by boat. No such mass exodus has materialized, but other problems with the program have surfaced.

One reason officials cited for extending temporary protected status to Haitians was so they could get jobs and send more money home. But applicants are being asked to scrape together nearly $500 in government fees, money that could be going instead to family members in Haiti.

Legal advocates said many of the estimated 100,000 Haitians eligible for temporary protected status have not been working and cannot afford the fees.

“The No. 1 problem is the money,” said Randolph P. McGrorty, the chief executive of Catholic Charities Legal Services in Miami, which collected more than 2,000 applications in the last week, with many still lacking the required money order.

Mr. McGrorty said that it was possible to get the fees waived, but that such requests would delay applications. “So far, they have refused to grant a blanket fee waiver,” he said.

Applicants pay $50 for temporary protected status, $80 for a background check and $340 for permission to work. Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said that the fees were set by Congress and that only Congress could allow a blanket fee waiver.

Though federal officials have said they would be “generous” when reviewing individual applications for fee waivers, it is not clear exactly what it takes to qualify.

“It depends on a case-by-case basis,” said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which runs the program. “There’s no one answer, that here’s what you have to submit to be able to get it.”

Maricame Aristide, 63, who has supported herself as a live-in maid since her application for permanent residency was turned down, came to St. Clements Catholic Church in Broward County on Monday for help with her application. She said that even if she had that kind of money, she would rather send it to her orphaned grandson, now living on the streets of Port-au-Prince with Ms. Aristide’s sister.

Evacuees continue to pour into the United States, many in need of basics like clothes and diapers. As of Monday morning, 15,666 people had been evacuated from Haiti to the United States. Of those, 12,497 were American citizens, according to State Department figures. The rest were legal permanent residents or the adult escorts of minor citizens like Ms. Guerrier-Cavalier, or like Darline Chery, 35, and her husband, Wladimyr, who managed to get their three daughters, all born in the United States, to Fort Lauderdale.

The Chery family, whose members have only tourist visas, is staying in the one-bedroom apartment of a cousin. The oldest daughter, who is 6, has already been enrolled in school. In Haiti, Mr. Chery was a travel agent and Ms. Chery worked for a non-governmental organization. Without the ability to work now, they are at a loss.

“We are all extremely traumatized,” Ms. Chery said, holding her 4-month-old baby and speaking in a very quiet Creole.

Instead of being able to help themselves and relatives at home, parents with short-term visas have been forced to ask for help themselves. Ms. Guerrier-Cavalier and the Cherys have already applied for Medicaid benefits and food stamps for their children.

“My husband is doing everything that can be done,” Ms. Chery said. “Because when you have a family and you’re the parent, you’re supposed to be taking care of them.”
836 2010-01-28 “We need a new Bretton Woods,” Mr. Sarkozy told a packed auditorium. “We can’t have on the one hand a multipolar world and on the other a single reserve currency on a global level.”

In a thinly veiled reference to China keeping its currency at an undervalued level, he added: “We cannot on the one hand laud free markets and on the other tolerate monetary dumping.”

During its 2011 presidency of the Group of 8 — the leading Western industrial powers plus Russia — and the wider G-20, which includes several important developing nations, France “will put the reform of the international monetary system on the agenda,” Mr. Sarkozy said.

Mr. Sarkozy also warned that the economic recovery currently under way remained vulnerable, urging central banks against withdrawing monetary stimulus measures too abruptly, saying it could prompt a collapse of the world economy.

"We must take care to prevent too abrupt a tightening,” he said.

Mr. Sarkozy's speech found few supporters among bankers and executives at adinner here Wednesday evening. Some managers said his call for a newmonetary system was merely an attempt to increase the importance of theeuro and raise France's profile ahead of next year's Group of 20 meetings.Mr. Sarkozy's endorsement of plans put forward earlier by Britain to taxfinancial transactions also failed to stir the audience.

The powerbrokers at Davos were not Mr. Sarkozy’s only audience. Six weeks ahead of regional elections in France, which are widely expected to be at least partly a judgment on his presidency, the president has tried to reverse a decline in his approval rating, currently at a record low.

“It was an effective, quite populist speech,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor at Oxford and political commentator who was in the audience. “As always at Davos, national leaders are at least half talking to their own audience.”

In 2008, when France held the presidency of the European Union for six months, Mr. Sarkozy proved a dynamic — if controversial — leader, first negotiating a ceasefire that halted the war in Georgia with Russia, and then bringing together European leaders to coordinate their response to the financial crisis.

As president of the G-20, he could repeat that performance, and even observers who find his style at times overbearing applaud his tenacity and energy.

“The dynamism of the chair,” Mr. Garton Ash said, “may bring some more substance to the G-20.”

Mr. Sarkozy was the first French president to give the keynote address at the Davos forum, and it afforded him the chance to pit well-paid bankers against ordinary citizens.

He reiterated themes that have resounded in recent days, starting with President Obama, who proposed a tax on banks’ liabilities, and then went further, suggesting that their size should be limited.

The French president said he agreed with Mr. Obama, but stressed that all regulation concerning banks should be dealt with at an international level, coordinated by the G-20.

Calling the current crisis a “crisis of globalization itself,” he urged broad coordination of regulation and accounting rules.

“If competition is distorted by accounting rules that remain very different from one country to another, and one continent to another, market actors will find it normal to return to precrisis habits,” Mr. Sarkozy said. “How, in a competitive world, can we demand of European banks three times more capital to cover their risks in their activities and not ask the same of American and Asian banks?”

His aim was not, he stressed, to do away with capitalism itself but to tame financial markets. To this aim, a tax, he said, was now unavoidable.

“We can’t escape the debate about taxing speculation,” Mr. Sarkozy said. “Whether you want to rein in frenetic financial markets, finance development aid or associate poor countries to the fight against climate change, everything brings us back to the taxation of financial transactions.”
837 2010-01-28 SAN FRANCISCO  After months of feverish speculation, Steven P. Jobs introduced Wednesday what Apple hopes will be the coolest device on the planet: a slender tablet computer called the iPad.

For all the hoopla surrounding it, however, the question is whether the iPad can achieve anything close to the success of the iPhone, which transformed the cellphone and forced the industry to race to catch up.

Apple is positioning the device, some versions of which will be available in March, as a pioneer in a new genre of computing, somewhere between a laptop and a smartphone. “The bar is pretty high,” Mr. Jobs acknowledged. “It has to be far better at doing some key things.”

Half an inch thick and weighing 1 1/2 pounds, the device will vividly display books, newspapers, Web sites and videos on a 9.7-inch glass touch screen. Giving media companies another way to sell content, it may herald a new era for publishing.

But the iPad, costing $499 to $829, also lacks some features common in laptops and phones, as technology enthusiasts were quick to point out. To its instant critics, it was little more than an oversize iPod Touch. A camera is notably absent, and Flash, the ubiquitous software that handles video and animation on the Web, does not work on the device.

Another thing missing is an alternative to the AT&T data network, which is already buckling under the strain of traffic to and from iPhones. Some versions of the iPad can, for a monthly fee, use a 3G data connection like cellphones, but the only carrier mentioned was AT&T.

The event, in typical Apple style, was tightly scripted and heavy on theatrics and hyperbole. But the success of the iPhone, and the hive of rumors and leaks surrounding the iPad, raised expectations and made this perhaps Mr. Jobs’s most highly anticipated product unveiling yet.

It was one that he clearly cared deeply about. Mr. Jobs, a consummate showman, presented the iPad to an enthusiastic crowd of around 800 employees, business partners and journalists, some of whom shoved their way in when the doors opened to grab the best seats. It was only his second public appearance since a leave of absence for health reasons last year.

Mr. Jobs posited that the iPad was the best device for certain kinds of computing, like browsing the Web, reading e-books and playing video.

The iPad “is so much more intimate than a laptop, and it’s so much more capable than a smartphone with its gorgeous screen,” he said in presenting the device to a crowd of journalists and Apple employees here. “It’s phenomenal to hold the Internet in your hands.”

One question Apple faces is whether there is enough room for another device in the cluttered lives of consumers.

“I think this will appeal to the Apple acolytes, but this is essentially just a really big iPod Touch,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research, adding that he expected the iPad to mostly cannibalize the sales of other Apple products.

Mr. Golvin said book lovers would continue to opt for lighter, cheaper e-readers like the Amazon Kindle, while people looking for a small Web-ready computer would gravitate toward the budget laptops known as netbooks.

But other analysts say they have heard similar criticism before  once aimed at the iPhone, which has now been bought by more than 42 million people around the world. These believers say Apple’s judgment on the market is nearly infallible.

“The target audience is everyone,” said Michael Gartenberg, vice president for strategy and analysis at Interpret, a market research firm. “Apple does not build products for just the enthusiasts. It doesn’t build for the tens of thousands; it builds for the tens of millions.”

Apple says the iPad will run the 140,000 applications developed for the iPhone and the iPod Touch, but the company expects a new wave of programs tailored to the iPad.

One of the most significant applications for the iPad may be Apple’s own creation, called iBooks, an e-reading program that will connect to Apple’s new online e-bookstore.

Mr. Jobs said Apple so far had relationships with five major publishers  Hachette, Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan  and was eager to make deals with others. Publishers will be able to charge $12.99 to $14.99 for most general fiction and nonfiction books.

Apple’s announcement that it was diving into the growing e-book business put the company on a collision course with Amazon. Mr. Jobs credited Amazon with pioneering e-readers with the Kindle but said “we are going to stand on their shoulders and go a little bit farther.”

John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who serves on Amazon’s board and is also an adviser to Apple, said there could be room for both companies, noting that Amazon sells many books to iPhone owners who use its Kindle application, which will also work on the iPad.

“I don’t think Jeff Bezos is going to leave the e-book business,” he said, referring to Amazon’s chief executive, “and I don’t think it will be confined to the Kindle.”

Three models of the iPad, $499 to $699, will connect to the Internet only via a local Wi-Fi connection. Three other versions will include 3G wireless access and will be available later in the spring, costing an additional $130 and requiring a data plan from AT&T. Owners of the iPhone who already pay at least $70 a month to AT&T will not be getting any breaks.

Other companies have sold tablet computers for years, but they never caught on with consumers. In 2001, Bill Gates predicted at an industry trade show that tablets would be the most popular form of PC sold in America within five years.

“The fact that he and Microsoft didn’t deliver is surprising,” said Tim Bajarin, a longtime industry analyst. “It has taken Apple to bring this to consumers and make it work.”

Apple has been working on a tablet computer for more than a decade, according to several former employees. Improved technology has helped the company to finally bring a model to market, as has the ubiquity of wireless networks.

The success of the iPhone and its cousin, the iPod Touch, have shown a path for tablets. People have been willing to pay to customize those devices with applications, turning them into video game machines, compasses, city guides and e-book readers.

The iPad will be a big opportunity for software developers, said Raven Zachary, president of Small Society, an iPhone development company based in Portland, Ore. “Although I think some of us were a bit surprised we only have 60 days until it launches to develop for it.”
838 2010-01-28 Stocks reversed an early slide and ended higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve issued a more upbeat assessment of the economy.

Major stock indexes were down before the Fed released its statement, then advanced as investors digested the central bank’s comments after a two-day meeting on interest rates. Treasury prices also reversed direction after the announcement, falling as investors withdrew money.

The Fed said it believed “economic activity has continued to strengthen” since its last meeting in December, but it did not repeat its assertion that the housing market was improving.

Although it left interest rates near zero, as expected, the Fed noted that Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, had voted against the decision.

James A. Cox, managing partner at the Harris Financial Group in Colonial Heights, Va., said Mr. Hoenig’s vote signaled that the central bank was moving closer to raising rates.
839 2010-01-28 The Boeing Company posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday and said testing of its two newest planes was on track.

Boeing also said it would not scale back aircraft production, which some had feared. Its forecast for 2010 profit was less than analysts had expected, but shares of Boeing rose $4.22, or 7.3 percent, to $61.93 on Wednesday.

Boeing said it earned $1.27 billion, or $1.75 a share, in the fourth quarter, reversing a loss of $86 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 42 percent, to $17.94 billion from $12.66 billion.

Results in last year’s fourth quarter were constrained by a strike and a charge for delays on the 747-8 plane.

Operating profit at Boeing’s commercial airplane division rose to $1.02 billion, reversing a year-earlier loss of $968 million.

853 2010-01-29 KABUL, Afghanistan — Members of the Taliban leadership met with a United Nations official earlier this month to discuss the possibility of entering into face-to-face peace talks with the Afghan government, American and United Nations officials said Friday.

Kai Eide, the United Nations’ special representative in Afghanistan, met with a group of Taliban leaders in the days leading to this week’s international conference in London, where President Hamid Karzai invited the Taliban to enter peace talks.

“He wanted to test for himself the mindset of some of the Taliban leaders,” said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was briefed by Mr. Eide on the talks. The discussions were confirmed by a United Nations official in Kabul.

Most of the important details of the meeting were unknown: exactly when and where the meeting took place; what, if anything, was agreed upon; and who represented the Taliban.

The talks between the Taliban and Mr. Eide came at a time of stepped-up diplomatic activity over the war in Afghanistan. Even as they pour in tens of thousands of more troops to fight in the country, American leaders have begun to search for a road that could eventually lead to a political settlement with the Taliban’s leaders.
854 2010-01-29 OTTAWA — The Supreme Court of Canada ruled Friday that Canadian agents violated the rights of the only Canadian citizen held at the Guantánamo Bay detention center when they interrogated him there. But the ruling, the second concerning the man’s politically sensitive case, does not order the government to demand his return to Canada, as he has long requested.

The man, Omar Khadr, was 15 years old and severely wounded when he was captured by American forces in Afghanistan during 2002. Mr. Khadr still faces an American military commission on charges that he killed a member of the United States military with a hand grenade during a battle.

As was the case with its earlier judgment, the Supreme Court was very critical of methods used at Guantánamo both by the United States and visiting Canadian officials. It said that use of tactics like sleep deprivation before Mr. Khadr was questioned by Canadians in 2003 and 2004 were a particularly offensive violation of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms because of his age.

“Interrogation of a youth, to elicit statements about the most serious criminal charges while detained in these conditions and without access to counsel, and while knowing that the fruits of the interrogations would be shared with the U.S. prosecutors, offends the most basic Canadian standards about the treatment of detained youth suspects,” the court said in its decision.

The Conservative government has repeatedly refused to grant requests that it follow the lead of other Western countries and ask the United States to return Mr. Khadr. After the Federal Court of Canada ordered it to do so in an earlier decision, politicians and government lawyers argued that it was not the role of courts to interfere in Canada’s foreign relations.

871 2010-01-29 Getting the resort to that state and keeping it there involves a monumental amount of snow moving. Gayda said that about 45 workers had been working through 24-hour shifts to haul artificial snow from piles at the top of the mountain — where temperatures have stayed below freezing and precipitation has fallen as snow — to the balmier lower levels.

To that end, Gayda said, workers have deployed 24 snow-grooming machines and two or three oversize dump trucks normally used for mining. Two helicopters are also ferrying around 1,000-pound bales of straw, which are being used as a base for features like moguls.

Some pre-Olympic events at Cypress Mountain were canceled early last year because of a warm spell. Gayda said the organizers learned from that experience that it is better to rebuild with artificial snow rather than natural snow, which tends to become excessively soft and wet in above freezing conditions.

VONN PICKS A WINNER A 60-year-old retired machinist from Pocatello, Idaho, won the American Alpine racer Lindsey Vonn’s public contest to design the helmet she will wear at the Vancouver Games.

Two of the other three finalists among more than 300 entrants were professional designers or artists, but the winner, Laddie Lee Whitworth, is an amateur artist who worked for 37 years in a cement factory. He is also a member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes at Idaho’s Fort Hall reservation.

Whitworth’s design is red, white and blue with flames flowing from front to back, like something on the fenders of a drag racing car. There is an American flag just over the helmet’s brow.

“When Lindsey pushes out of that Olympic start gate, this is the people’s helmet,” Whitworth said in a telephone interview. “It’s for an American star at the Olympics. It’s pretty symbolic.”

In a conference call with reporters, Vonn said that Whitworth’s design reminded her of the Olympic torch and that it looked aggressive and speedy. BILL PENNINGTON

872 2010-01-29 Leo, an all-boys Catholic school at 79th and Sangamon, gradually came to reflect the changed demographic as white alumni stopped sending their sons there. The last white students graduated in 1992. Enrollment is less than a quarter of its 1,200-student peak during the school’s heyday as a Catholic League powerhouse, and Leo’s future has long been in question.

But Bob Foster, 69, made it his life’s mission to keep the school open. A former Leo football star whose bent-nose bluntness reflects a lifetime of line play, Foster was Leo’s football coach, principal and president for more than 40 years before stepping down for health reasons earlier this month. Leo was built in 1926 to serve boys from Chicago’s working-class South Side, Foster said, and that mission shouldn’t change just because the makeup of the neighborhood changed from Irish, Italian and Polish immigrants to blacks.

Foster had a small group of deep-pocketed alumni he could call on for help with big-ticket expenses like a new furnace, but the smaller donations he coaxed from the middle-class graduates were the school’s real economic engine. The policemen, firefighters, teachers and tradesmen supported Leo even after they stopped sending their sons. Leo endures as an inner-city symbol of educational opportunity, a haven in a troubled area plagued by gang violence.

The alumni hold banquets, golf outings and decal drives to increase fund-raising, but Friday’s function was personal, an opportunity to see where the money goes and to meet the beneficiaries. Having Brother Rice as the opponent was an added bonus: The schools have been fierce rivals since the ’60s, sharing an Irish Christian Brothers teaching heritage. Rice is at 99th and Pulaski, an area of the Southwest Side that has always seemed like affluent suburbia to Leo students who like to think of themselves as a grittier bunch. Rivalry aside, Rice is where many Leo graduates have been sending their sons for years.

Friday’s crowd, though, was exuberantly pro-Leo, and they yelled themselves hoarse during the Lions’ 76-72 victory, a crackling good game that required overtime. Between the third and fourth quarters, gray-haired white retirees and dread-locked black hip-hoppers stood together to deliver a spirited rendition of the school’s fight song — “Oh when those Leo men fall into line ...” — an uplifting display of harmony not often seen in this pocket of the fractious South Side.

Afterward, at Coach Noah Cannon’s behest, the Leo players mixed with the alumni, introducing themselves and shaking hands, a rare intermingling of black and white, old and young. All Leo men. Malcolm McFarland, a senior guard and the team captain, said the Lions enjoyed having the old-timers in the house.

“It was nice,” he said. “We want to show them Leo is as strong as it was when they were here.”

Cannon, a point guard at Leo who graduated in 1995, runs a tight ship and would be in demand at a bigger school if he said the word — he won a state championship at Leo in 2004. Instead, he’s in the forefront of efforts to get alumni from his generation more involved in preserving Leo. He believes he owes his life to the school.

During his senior year, Cannon resisted when three gang members tried to rob him at 79th and Morgan one fall morning, and he bears a hook-shaped scar from the broken whiskey bottle they used to slice open his scalp. Foster, alerted by a younger student who saw the assault, ran a block and a half to where Cannon lay and helped control the bleeding until paramedics arrived and got him to a hospital.

“Mr. Foster saved my life,” Cannon said, “and by being at Leo, I’m giving back. I’m here as long as Leo is here. This is where I’m needed.”
873 2010-01-29 “It’s very hard to have the appearance that there is no conflict of interest when your primary funders are always from a small industry that has the most at stake in your decisions,” said Cindi Canary, director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform.

In an interview this week, Mr. Berrios said the board did not show favoritism.

“No one gets a reduction just because they contribute money,” he said. “No one has to contribute a dime.”

One of Mr. Berrios’s two opponents in Tuesday’s primary, Raymond A. Figueroa, a former alderman and retired Cook County circuit judge, said he advocated prohibiting donations from property tax lawyers to the assessor or appeals board commissioners.

Mr. Figueroa accused Mr. Berrios of taking part in a “pay-to-play” system. “No wonder these lawyers like him,” he said. “They love him, in fact. Their clients benefit from Mr. Berrios’s golden touch.”

Thanks largely to property tax lawyers, Mr. Berrios has raised more in this campaign than two of the four Democratic candidates for county board president. In one day alone, on Jan. 8, the tax appeal bar chipped in a total of more than $33,000 for Mr. Berrios.

Mr. Berrios said in the interview this week that he believed that the board’s decisions were fair and that he hoped to “make the assessor’s office work for the taxpayers.”

Mr. Berrios is not the only local elected official who gets large sums of campaign money from people who stand to gain from his official decisions. Still, the analysis of records revealed that he relies on political financing from property tax lawyers to a far greater extent than James M. Houlihan, the sitting assessor, and the other two Board of Review commissioners.

Mr. Houlihan, who is stepping down after 12 years in office, has raised about as much money over all as Mr. Berrios, but donations from lawyers who handle appeals to his office make up only about one-quarter of Mr. Houlihan’s campaign money.

When he first ran for assessor, Mr. Houlihan sought money from former clients and others whom he had met as a lobbyist because he wanted to avoid relying heavily on property tax lawyers for his re-election campaigns, he said this week.

“I didn’t want the office to have the tone that, unless you contribute to me, you don’t have access,” Mr. Houlihan said.

While largesse from tax lawyers increased Mr. Berrios’s campaign accounts, his political profile also expanded three years ago when he became chairman of the local Democratic organization. After growing up in the Cabrini Green housing project, he graduated from Lane Tech High School and received an accounting degree. He entered politics working under his precinct captain, and was once an employee of the property tax appeal board before being elected commissioner in 1988.

The assessor’s office, where Mr. Berrios wants to work next, sets the tax bill for every parcel in the county, and it is the first avenue of appeal for property owners who feel they are not being taxed fairly. Every year, however, more than 200,000 taxpayers seek further relief from the Board of Review, and many of them hire lawyers to argue on their behalf.

Several of the firms that have saved their clients the most money through appeals to the board have strong political connections. The most successful include the firms of Michael J. Madigan, the Illinois House speaker, a Chicago Democrat and a close ally of Mr. Berrios; Patrick J. Cullerton, brother of John Cullerton, the president of the Illinois Senate; and Alderman Edward Burke (14th Ward). At the same time, Mr. Berrios has moonlighted as a Springfield lobbyist for such causes as legalizing video poker.

While the politically connected firms have made relatively modest donations to Mr. Berrios’s campaign committees, many other top property tax lawyers have given tens of thousands of dollars over the years.

Some firms doing substantial business with Mr. Berrios donate campaign money in ways that sidestep county ethics rules that prohibit anybody who does business with the county from giving more than $1,500 to a candidate in the primary campaign. Finkel, Martwick & Colson pitched in the maximum $1,500 in the firm’s name, but another $1,500 went to Mr. Berrios’s campaign from each of five lawyers who work for the firm.

The Board of Review shaved $177.9 million from the assessed values of properties owned by the firm’s clients from 2006 to 2008, results that placed Finkel, Martwick & Colson seventh on the list of the most successful property tax firms during that period.

In the past decade, the firm’s lawyers have been the top political donors to Mr. Berrios and his daughter, contributing $164,400 to their campaigns. Indeed, 40 percent of the money that has gone into Ms. Berrios’s campaign fund has come from property tax lawyers who are active at the Board of Review.

Nearly all the top property tax appeal lawyers contacted did not return calls or declined comment. But Robert S. Vihon of Worsek & Vihon said he and his colleagues gave to Mr. Berrios because the commissioner and his chief deputy, Thomas Jaconetty, were highly experienced.

“They are very bright guys who work very hard to try to work with taxpayers,” Mr. Vihon said.

Besides the more than $3.2 million donated to Mr. Berrios and his daughter, the property tax bar has contributed more than $800,000 to another Board of Review commissioner, Larry R. Rogers Jr., representing 52 percent of Mr. Rogers’s fund-raising total.

Brendan Houlihan, who is not related to the outgoing assessor, has been the third commissioner since 2006 and received $163,400 from the lawyers, for 27 percent of his total financing.
874 2010-01-29 I would like to point out that my family’s successful lawsuit against the state is based solely on the use of eminent domain to benefit a private university. Unfortunately, some Columbia supporters have equated our principled stance on eminent domain with a general opposition to the expansion. This is not true.

We have always welcomed the Columbia expansion, not opposed it. Further, even if the decision is upheld, and eminent domain is not allowed in this case, Columbia will still be able to build its new campus, albeit with a different design.

The writer is president of Tuck-It-Away, a self-storage company that owns property in the proposed expansion zone.
875 2010-01-29 New research at San Francisco State University reveals just how common open relationships are among gay men and lesbians in the Bay Area. The Gay Couples Study has followed 556 male couples for three years — about 50 percent of those surveyed have sex outside their relationships, with the knowledge and approval of their partners.

That consent is key. “With straight people, it’s called affairs or cheating,” said Colleen Hoff, the study’s principal investigator, “but with gay people it does not have such negative connotations.”

The study also found open gay couples just as happy in their relationships as pairs in sexually exclusive unions, Dr. Hoff said. A different study, published in 1985, concluded that open gay relationships actually lasted longer.

None of this is news in the gay community, but few will speak publicly about it. Of the dozen people in open relationships contacted for this column, no one would agree to use his or her full name, citing privacy concerns. They also worried that discussing the subject could undermine the legal fight for same-sex marriage.

According to the research, open relationships almost always have rules.

That is how it works for Chris and James. Over drinks upstairs at the venerable Twin Peaks Tavern in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco, they beamed as they recalled the day in June 2008 that they donned black suits and wed at City Hall, stunned by the outpouring of affection from complete strangers. “Even homeless people and bike messengers were congratulating us,” said Chris, 42.

A couple since 2002, they opened their relationship a year ago after concluding that they were not fully meeting each other’s needs. But they have rules: complete disclosure, honesty about all encounters, advance approval of partners, and no sex with strangers — they must both know the other men first. “We check in with each other on this an awful lot,” said James, 37.

That transparency can make relationships stronger, said Joe Quirk, author of the best-selling relationship book “It’s Not You, It’s Biology.”

“The combination of freedom and mutual understanding can foster a unique level of trust,” Mr. Quirk, of Oakland, said.

“The traditional American marriage is in crisis, and we need insight,” he said, citing the fresh perspective gay couples bring to matrimony. “If innovation in marriage is going to occur, it will be spearheaded by homosexual marriages.”

Open relationships are not exclusively a gay domain, of course. Deb and Marius are heterosexual, live in the East Bay and have an open marriage. She belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and maintained her virginity until her wedding day at 34. But a few years later, when the relationship sputtered, both she and her husband, who does not belong to the church, began liaisons with others.

“Our relationship got better,” she said. “I slept better at night. My blood pressure went down.”

Deb and Marius also have rules, including restrictions on extramarital intercourse. “To us,” Marius said, “cheating would be breaking the agreement we have with each other. We define our relationship, not a religious group.”

So while the legal fight over same-sex marriage plays out, couples say the real battle is making relationships last — and their answers defy the prevailing definition of marriage.

“In 1900, the average life span for a U.S. citizen was 47,” Mr. Quirk said. “Now we’re living so much longer, ‘until death do us part’ is twice as challenging.”
876 2010-01-29 The Securities and Exchange Commission said it had reached a tentative settlement of a civil lawsuit against David A. Stockman, a former budget director in the Reagan administration. The agency said in the suit that he and other executives of the bankrupt auto-parts maker Collins & Aikman of Southfield, Mich., had misled investors.

But federal prosecutors in January 2009 dismissed criminal fraud charges against Mr. Stockman and other executives at the company. Mr. Stockman became chairman and chief executive of Collins & Aikman in 2002, after the private equity fund he founded, Heartland Industrial Partners, became its majority investor. He said he lost $13 million in the collapse of Collins & Aikman, which filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and was liquidated in 2007.

He was accused of defrauding investors and banks of more than $1 billion. The case was dismissed after a lawyer for Mr. Stockman argued his innocence.

Terms of the tentative settlement were not disclosed. The S.E.C.’s suit also names Collins & Aikman as a defendant.

The S.E.C. said it had not reached a settlement with David Cosgrove, a former controller.
877 2010-01-29 The 3M Company, the diversified manufacturer, posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday and raised its forecast for 2010, citing strong demand for all its products.

But its shares fell, caught up in a stock market sell-off that was especially hard on industrial companies.

3M, probably best known for its trademark brands like Post-it notes and Scotch tape, reported fourth-quarter net income of $935 million, or $1.30 a share, up from $676 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.

Analysts had expected earnings of $1.21 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.

Revenue increased 11 percent, to $6.1 billion, above Wall Street forecasts for $5.77 billion.

The company, which makes a variety of products including adhesives, abrasives, stethoscopes and insect repellent, said the results were driven by a 15.7 percent jump in sales of display and graphics products, like the coatings found on high-definition TVs and computer monitors.

Strong sales of health care products, including masks used to prevent infections from the H1N1 flu virus and other pathogens, contributed to the results.
878 2010-01-29 ROCHESTER (AP) — The Eastman Kodak Company posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, setting off a 25 percent gain in its share price.

The results were lifted by consumer and commercial inkjet printer sales, leaner costs and royalties on digital imaging inventions.

The profit was Kodak’s first in five quarters.

Kodak said it earned $443 million, or $1.40 a share, reversing a loss of $918 million, or $3.42 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6 percent, to $2.58 billion from $2.43 billion.

Excluding one-time items, Kodak said it earned $1.08 a share, topping the 18 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Sales were better than the $2.38 billion forecast by analysts.

Shares in Kodak, which is based in Rochester, rose $1.17, to $5.92 a share.

“Despite a difficult economic environment, we delivered in 2009,” the chief executive, Antonio Perez, said. “Our momentum is returning and our strategy is paying off.”

Digital sales rose 12 percent to $1.99 billion, from $1.78 billion, while traditional film-based revenue fell 10 percent to $589 million, from $652 million.
879 2010-01-29 Backers of a statewide initiative to legalize marijuana said they would submit about 700,000 signatures collected statewide, far more than the roughly 434,000 signatures needed to qualify the measure for the November ballot. The proposed Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 would legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for adults. It would also allow limited growing on private property and permit local governments to decide whether to legalize and tax marijuana sales.
880 2010-01-29 SAN FRANCISCO  Apple has generated a lot of chatter with its new iPad tablet. But it may not be quite the conversation it wanted.

Many women are saying the name evokes awkward associations with feminine hygiene products. People from Boston to Ireland are complaining that “iPad,” in their regional brogue, sounds almost indistinguishable from “iPod,” Apple’s music player.

Then there are more serious conflicts. Two other high-tech companies already market products called iPad and are laying claim to the trademark.

In the hours after the iPad announcement on Wednesday, “iTampon” became one of the most popular trending topics on Twitter. Apple’s communication team fielded a wave of queries on the subject but characteristically declined to comment.

“I care about words and their connotations, but you don’t have to be in junior high to make this leap,” said Robin Bernstein, a corporate speech writer on Long Island, who addressed the issue on her Facebook page on Wednesday. “A lot of women when they hear the word ‘pad’ are going to think about feminine hygiene.”

Michael Cronan, a naming consultant in Berkeley, Calif., whose company has helped come up with brands like TiVo and Kindle, said many naming experiments show that women tend to reflexively relate words like “pad” and “flow” to bodily concerns.

He is not sure Apple could have found an alternative that ties in as perfectly to its famous brands. “I think we’re going to get over this fairly quickly and we’ll get on with enjoying the experience.”

But the folks at Fujitsu, the Japanese technology firm, may not be quite so eager to forgive and forget. The company has applied for the iPad trademark in the United States and already sells an iPad  a $2,000 hand-held device that shop clerks use to check inventory.

STMicroelectronics, the Swiss semiconductor company, owns the iPad trademark in Europe and uses it as an acronym for integrated passive and active devices  which sounds less fun than playing games on a tablet. (A third company, MagTek of Seal Beach, Calif., makes a portable magnetic card reader of the same name.)

These kinds of naming conflicts have not stopped Apple before. In 2007, on the eve of the introduction of the iPhone, the technology giant Cisco Systems pointed out that it already sold an Internet handset called the iPhone. Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, led the negotiation for the name, peppering Cisco executives with calls at all hours, and telling them he was prepared to claim that Cisco was underutilizing the trademark.

Mr. Jobs finally persuaded Cisco to surrender the trademark with a vague promise to market their products jointly  a partnership that never materialized.

“He’s a very tough businessman and tough negotiator,” said Charles Giancarlo, a former Cisco executive who dealt directly with Mr. Jobs on the issue. “I feel sorry for the poor guy at Fujitsu who is going to be negotiating with Steve directly.”
881 2010-01-29 Black pepper used in salami is the possible cause of a salmonella outbreak that sickened people in 40 states, the Rhode Island Department of Health said. Tests showed the same strain of salmonella that has sickened at least 189 people since July was also found in two open containers of pepper at the Burrillville plant of Daniele International, a meat company. The company recalled 1.2 million pounds of pepper-coated salami on Saturday.
882 2010-01-29 Supporters of the change have framed the issue as a way to prevent the disenfranchisement of poor, mostly minority communities.

“The present rule takes people who come from and return to poor or black and Latino communities and transfers their value for reapportionment purposes to rural upstate districts that really have nothing to do with them,” said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat from the Upper West Side of Manhattan who is leading the effort to change the way prisoners are counted.

But Republicans say that aside from depriving upstate districts of representation in the Legislature, the plan would unfairly change the way one group is counted without changing how other transient groups, like university students and military families, are counted.

“This isn’t purely black and white; you need consistency,” said Senator Joseph A. Griffo, a Republican whose North Country district includes four prisons. “To me, until you change everything, you don’t change one specific component.”

If the proposal becomes law, New York would become the first state where prisoners are not considered residents of the district where they are incarcerated for purposes of determining the size of legislative districts. Similar proposals have been introduced recently in Illinois, Wisconsin and at the federal level, but none have become law.

The average time served for an inmate in New York is about 3.6 years. “That’s less time than most college students spend away from home,” said Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is sponsoring the prisoner-counting legislation in the Assembly.

An analysis conducted by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that studies incarceration patterns, found that seven upstate Senate districts would not have met the minimum population requirements if prisoners had been excluded when district lines were last redrawn in 2002. All seven of those districts were held by Republicans; five of them still are.

In all, 44,326 New York City residents were counted as residents of other parts of the state when district lines were last redrawn. Subtracting the 586 prisoners in New York City who were not city residents, the city’s net population loss was 43,740.

The result, the study said, has been an overpopulation of Senate districts in New York City and an underpopulation of districts upstate. The population of districts are supposed to be relatively constant, but the law allows for slight variations. As a result, some Senate districts upstate barely meet the population requirement, while some districts downstate nearly exceed the requirement. Currently, a district’s population must be no more than 5 percent higher or lower than 306,072.

The district represented by Senator Elizabeth O’C. Little, a Republican, is the example most often cited by advocates for changing the law. When the boundaries of her district were drawn in 2002, the Senate included nearly 13,000 prisoners as residents, or about 4 percent of its total population.

Department of Correctional Services data from this month showed that Ms. Little’s district had about 11,000 prisoners, reflecting a statewide trend toward a shrinking prison population.

Ms. Little said in an interview that changing the way prisoners were counted would distort census data. “The purpose of the census is to record who is living where at a given period of time,” she said. “So if you’re in a nursing home at a certain time, you’re going to be counted there even if you’re just there for rehab. If you’re living in a college town while you’re away at a university, you’re going to be counted there. And if you’re in prison you’re going to be counted there.”

Ms. Little added that she viewed the prisoners in her district as her constituents, regardless of how temporary their stays might be. And she noted that they behave like other concerned constituents in one major way: they write. “I have gotten letters from inmates.”
883 2010-01-29 While Mr. Schumer is said by associates to be troubled by some of the attacks being leveled at Wall Street, he embraced the president’s proposal the day it was offered. He argues that the original bailout package actually requires the president to try to recover the bailout money from financial institutions if the money is not paid back after a certain period.

But Mr. Schumer’s position has surprised and frustrated his allies on Wall Street, where he has raised vast sums of money through his career, both for himself and for the national party.

Indeed, of the roughly $8.7 million he has collected since his last election, in 2004, about $1 million came from the financial industry, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan government watchdog organization.

At the same time, Mr. Schumer, a member of two committees with jurisdiction over the industry, has been a strong advocate for Wall Street, having been among the first officials in Washington to promote the rescue package as the financial crisis rocked the nation in late 2008.

A lobbyist for Wall Street interests, who asked not to be identified because he did not want to be seen as questioning Mr. Schumer’s approach, said financial leaders are sympathetic to the tough political climate Mr. Schumer finds himself in, with public sentiment turning against Wall Street. But the lobbyist said people in the financial world are nonetheless frustrated that the senator has not waged a more vigorous public defense of his hometown industry.

Responding to such concerns, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that while the senator believes that many practices on Wall Street must be reformed, “he will work to make sure the corrections will be productive, not vindictive, in order to create a stronger financial services industry in the future.”

In many respects, the issue has been much trickier for Ms. Gillibrand, who, unlike Mr. Schumer, is facing the prospect of a strong challenge this year and who has also turned to Wall Street to raise money through the years.

The senator has yet to say whether she supports or opposes the Obama proposal, even as her potential rival for the Democratic nomination, Harold E. Ford Jr., positions himself as a defender of Wall Street, where he is getting much of his initial support. Instead, Ms. Gillibrand has proposed giving banks a break on the tax based on how many loans they are providing to small businesses.

By contrast, Mr. Ford, a former congressman from Tennessee who moved to New York three years ago to take a job in banking, flatly rejects the tax. He argues that it could severely damage the city’s financial industry and, in turn, undermine New York’s economy.

Mr. Ford’s position is more closely aligned with that of Bruce A. Blakeman, a Long Island Republican running for Ms. Gillibrand’s seat. “It’s an attack on the financial industry,” Mr. Blakeman said of the tax. “I am going to be an outspoken advocate for our most important industry.”
884 2010-01-29 That’s a hefty figure, but not beyond the realm of possibility. Right now, despite improvements, Ford’s auto business is still losing money — $1.4 billion before tax last year. Ford’s overall profit stemmed from debt restructuring and a resurgent finance arm.

But say the global auto market recovers, and Ford’s vehicle sales jump 15 percent annually to $140 billion in 2011. If virtually all of the benefits from its continuing cost-cutting program flow through as earnings, the business could achieve a pretax margin next year of 3.8 percent. At 15 times earnings, the multiple Volkswagen currently fetches, Ford’s current valuation looks justified.

Of course, Volkswagen has earned that multiple because of its relatively consistent operating performance. Ford has been in trouble for years. If shareholders aren’t convinced this Motown manufacturer’s rebound is here to stay, the fivefold jump in its stock in the last 12 months looks overdone.

Carl C. Icahn has given Biogen Idec a needed shake-up. As an activist investor, he won two board seats, pushed out the chief executive and pressured the company to put itself up for sale. But none of it has generated much of a return for shareholders in Biogen, a biotech company. Mr. Icahn wants three more seats on the board, which has 12 members. But unless he proposes new ideas, his 6 percent stake in the company doesn’t merit the extra influence.

Biogen has had its problems. The company’s labs don’t appear particularly effective at drug discovery despite spending a higher percentage of revenue on research and development than the typical biotech business. The shares have underperformed the Amex Biotech index by more than 50 percent over the last five years.

But Mr. Icahn didn’t talk with his feet. He won his board appointees last year after a two-year fight. The burden now falls on him to show why he should have three more.

Mr. Icahn could try to sell the company, but Biogen doesn’t look too appealing. Yes, it’s valued at 3.5 times estimated sales, while competitors trade at around five times. But Biogen ought to be discounted. Even its most attractive drugs, like Tysabri for multiple sclerosis, are encumbered by licensing agreements and change-of-control clauses that mean a buyer of Biogen might not end up owning Tysabri.

Mr. Icahn’s other proposal, splitting the company, doesn’t seem likely to generate value. Biogen’s administrative costs as a percentage of sales are already below competitors like Amgen and Genzyme.

The best way to improve Biogen would be to appoint a good chief executive. An Icahn appointee is one of the four board members on the search committee. So Mr. Icahn already has a say in who will run the company.

If Mr. Icahn can devise a credible plan for Biogen, he may warrant more seats. He hasn’t yet. If he really wants to control the company’s direction, perhaps he should just make a bid to buy it.
885 2010-01-29 A federal appeals court has decided that a lower court erred in 2007 when it ruled in favor of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in a bitter dispute between the museum and the artist Christoph Büchel over an immense, unfinished installation.

The United States Court of Appeals in Boston ruled on Wednesday that a federal district judge should have found that the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 — part of the Copyright Act that protects artists against having their names associated with works “in the event of a distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work” — applies to unfinished works like Mr. Büchel’s.

“Moral rights protect the personality and creative energy that an artist contributes to his or her work,” the ruling by the three-judge panel found. “That convergence between artist and artwork does not await the final brushstroke or the placement of the last element in a complex installation.”

The appeals panel found that the district judge improperly granted the museum summary judgment in parts of the case and that there were “material disputes of fact” that should be decided by a jury about whether the museum distorted Mr. Büchel’s installation by showing it to several people after making changes in it without his approval.

Mr. Büchel has become well known for creating elaborate, politically provocative environments. His conception for the work in Massachusetts, to be called “Training Ground for Democracy,” was that it would mimic and mock the kind of training that is used by the United States military to help soldiers adapt to unfamiliar cultures.
886 2010-01-29 If prices are flat or still falling, the number of sales seems to be increasing, real estate offices across the West said. Patti Brave, a broker in the Cordillera office of Slifer, Smith & Frampton in the Vail Valley in Colorado, said that the first seven months of 2009 were dismal, but that the rising stock market had helped drive up sales, though prices at Vail and Beaver Creek are still off by 10 percent or more in the last three years.

Telluride, the historic Colorado mining town tucked in the end of a valley in the remote San Juan Mountains, remains a bright spot for sellers, agents there say. Steve Finger, owner of Finbro Construction and Development, is building Element 52, a 200,000-square-foot, 32-unit luxury condo project overlooking town. The development, which is more than 60 percent sold, is named for tellurium, No. 52 on the periodic table.

Even with mortgage rates holding at around 4 percent for qualified buyers, cash deals are king right now, brokers say.

In Jackson, Wyo., “buyers are paying cash and determining the market,” said Greg Prugh, a broker, who said prices have fallen by as much as 50 percent since 2007. He recently sold a two-bedroom condo in Teton Village listed at $700,000 for $360,000 in cash. “Modern-day Jackson was built on construction, financing and real estate,” he said. “With financing tight, those jobs are gone, and the middle-class people who bought condos on spec are forced to sell.”

The huge price cuts seem to be bringing in more traffic, brokers say. “Phones are ringing and people are walking into our offices again,” said Martha Johnson, president of Rivers to Peaks Big Sky Real Estate in Big Sky, Mont. A recent client, William Martin, 53, and his wife, Susan, 51, from Locust Grove, Ga., paid $275,000 for a condo listed at $600,000 in the Big Sky Town Center, because “we’ve been coming here for 17 years to ski,” he said. “It is not crowded, not pretentious and the price was right.”

For the first time since a major downturn in 2007, Tom Peek, a partner at the Park City office of Prudential Utah Real Estate, is seeing “a lot of pent-up demand” for real estate in Park City-Deer Valley.

“Normally we don’t see a lot of activity until Christmas time,” Mr. Peek said, “but our market started picking up around Thanksgiving, before the slopes were even open.”

A two-bedroom condo on the ice rink in Park City could go for $600,000 (less for cash), he said; a few years ago it would have cost more than $1 million. In New Park and Redstone, developments within five miles of the ski areas, a two-bedroom new-construction condo would cost under $300,000.

Shari Chase, president and chief executive of Chase International real estate in Nevada, said low mortgage rates (around 4 percent for buyers with good credit scores) and a federal tax credit of $6,500 for eligible repeat home buyers have helped to revive the condo market in South Lake Tahoe and Incline Village. “People are looking for long-term investments,” she said, “and that’s putting something that’s very solid and much needed into the foundation of the housing industry.”

“There are great values in all the areas that were overbuilt during the real estate boom years,” she added. “What was a million is now $600,000, and a $600,000 condo will sell for $325,000.”

Pamela Goetz, associate broker at Sotheby’s International Realty Sun Valley, said: “We all got into a fantasy world there for a while but are going back to the old rules of real estate: Make a wise purchase and anticipate holding it for a while.”

Ski areas in the Northeast have not been hit as hard those in the West, but condo prices, already lower than those in the West, are now the lowest in decades, brokers say. Stowe, Vt., has seen a “noticeable uptick” in activity in the last few months, particularly at the high end, said Brent Libby, managing broker in the Stowe office of Sotheby’s Vermont Country Properties.

“Owners of some luxury properties are highly motivated to sell and have made it known,” he said. He recently sold a condo listed at $1.175 million for less than $900,000 (cash) and expects the bargain prices to hold up through the spring but probably not beyond.

Many of his clients come from the financial world. “The stock market is up, and everyone is feeling optimistic,” he added.

Sunday River and Mount Abrams in Maine are known for uncrowded slopes, short lift lines and great snow even in bad years; more than 95 percent of the terrain has snow-making equipment. Ed Kennett of Kennett Realty in Bethel, Me., is listing condos that start at $70,000 for a studio and just under $200,000 for two-bedroom units. He anticipates that the market will hit bottom by June 2010, then prices will start to rise. “Sellers assume the bottom is hit before buyers want it to be,” he said.

Deb Howard, a second-home expert at the National Association of Realtors, said that though the 2009 market was the lowest it had been in a decade she expected some good news this year. Agents said traffic was particularly high during the holidays.

“Typical clients come to vacation in an area many times as a renters,” Ms. Howard said. “When they feel comfortable and are ready to buy, it can take months or even years to find the perfect second home.”

“Of course,” she added, “there are the clients who come once, fall in love and want to buy before they step on a plane to go back home.”
887 2010-01-29 SEATTLE (Reuters) — Microsoft posted a bigger-than-expected 60 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by strong sales of Windows 7, and said it expected business technology spending to recover this year.

The company said net profit came to $6.7 billion, or 74 cents a share, up from $4.2 billion, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.

The profit topped the 59 cents expected by analysts, and in after-hours trading, Microsoft’s stock rose slightly.

Analysts said the small gain reflected a rally in the stock price after the Windows 7 operating system was introduced in October.

Revenue in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the second quarter of Microsoft’s fiscal year, rose 14 percent, to $19.02 billion, from $16.63 billion. The income included $1.71 billion of deferred revenue from the Windows 7 introduction in October. Excluding that, sales were $17.31 billion.
888 2010-01-29 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 115.7 points, or 1.13 percent, at 10,120.46. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 1.18 percent, or 12.97 points, to 1,084.53, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.91 percent, or 42.41 points, to 2,179 points.

Two economic reports raised doubts among investors. The number of people filing first-time unemployment claims fell to 470,000 last week, a drop of 8,000; analysts had expected a drop of 32,000. That fueled concerns that job growth could take longer than previously thought, as investors await the release of January employment data.

A report on long-lasting goods like cars and computers showed that the recovery in manufacturing was steady but still moderate. Over all, orders for such durable goods rose 0.3 percent in December, falling short of Wall Street expectations of a 2 percent increase.

Stephen J. Carl, head equity trader for the Williams Capital Group, said the disappointing economic figures were causing investors to question whether stocks were out of touch with the actual pace of economic renewal.

“What you want to see going forward is a consistent round of positive economic numbers in each area before we can really give credence to the economy strengthening,” Mr. Carl said. “You want to see some kind of stability.”

He said the markets might be due for a correction, defined as a drop of 10 percent or more, because there was no significant pullback during last year’s remarkable rally, when the major indexes surged more than 20 percent.

Not even seemingly good news for the market from Washington could perk up investors. Ben S. Bernanke won an easy second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve on Thursday afternoon, with the Senate voting 70-30 to reconfirm him. But even though his confirmation was expected on Wall Street, investors remain concerned that Mr. Bernanke has been bruised by a wave of discontent and may face pressure to toughen his stance on banks.

As stocks declined Thursday, the dollar gained against most world currencies, hovering slightly under $1.40 against the euro.

Interest rates were steady. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 3/32, to 97 27/32, and the yield fell to 3.63 percent, from 3.65 percent.

Concerns about the possibility of a default in Greece persisted, with the cost of insuring debt rising to a record. European officials denied that the European Union was working on a bailout plan for Greece. The yield on Greek bonds rose above 7 percent.

In London, the FTSE 100 settled 71.73 points, or 1.37 percent, lower while the DAX in Frankfurt declined 102.87 points, or 1.8 percent. The CAC-40 in Paris was 71.01 points, or 1.9 percent, higher.

Following are the results of Thursday’s Treasury auction of seven-year notes:

892 2010-01-30 Just days after suspending Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton for the season for bringing pistols into the Washington Wizards’ locker room, the N.B.A. is facing the handgun issue again because of Nike.

The new issues of Sports Illustrated and ESPN the Magazine contain a two-page Nike ad with LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in dramatic black-and-white photos for the company’s “Prepare for Combat” campaign.

“I’ll do whatever it takes to win games,” Bryant is portrayed as saying. “I don’t leave anything in the chamber.”

His agent, Rob Pelinka, did not return a call to respond to whether Bryant approved the language.

Tim Frank, a league spokesman, said in an e-mail message: “We had no prior notice of this ad. We think it is inappropriate.” He would not elaborate, but he added that the league gets advance notice about ads, and approval rights, only if they contain the N.B.A.’s logo or trademarks.

Nike did not directly address Frank’s comments, but issued a statement that defended Bryant’s quotation.
893 2010-01-30 Stow the lawyers and bring on the big boats. The America’s Cup, for now, is out of the courtroom and in the hands of the sailors.

Justice Shirley Kornreich of the New York State Supreme Court on Friday essentially told the two-time defending champion, Alinghi of Switzerland, and the American challenger, BMW Oracle Racing, to go sail their best-of-three nautical grudge match. The competition, in giant multihulls, is scheduled to begin Feb. 8 in Valencia, Spain.

According to both teams, Kornreich said during a conference call with lawyers for the teams’ owners that she would not expedite a hearing in BMW Oracle Racing’s motion challenging the legality of the sails on the 90-foot catamaran Alinghi 5.

“This is excellent news,” Alinghi’s owner, Ernesto Bertarelli, said in a statement. “We are delighted that BMW Oracle’s attempts to disqualify Alinghi and to win the America’s Cup in court have been denied.

“We look forward to meeting them on the start line here in Valencia.”

Alinghi officials had said they would forfeit the Cup, the oldest trophy in international sports, if BMW Oracle Racing succeeded in getting the Swiss sails disqualified.
894 2010-01-30 The Yankees have been as emphatic as possible that Johnny Damon has ended his four-year run with the team. But as long as Damon remains unsigned, he continues to leave open the possibility that he could again be a Yankee.

Repeating comments he made to The New York Times last week, Damon told WFAN on Friday, “I never say never anymore.” He acknowledged that the Yankees’ $2 million contract agreement with Randy Winn leaves no spot for him on the roster, yet he would not rule out returning.

“Whenever it is, whether I start the season with them, or whether they trade for me at the deadline, or if they sign me next year, or what not — I love New York,” Damon told the radio station.

Damon, 36, turned down a two-year, $14 million offer from the Yankees in December, a proposal that was made at the same time the Yankees had offered a one-year, $5.5 million deal to Nick Johnson, who accepted. Damon made $13 million last season and did not want to take such a big pay cut.

Speaking in the interview about Derek Jeter, whose 10-year, $189 million contract expires after this season, Damon said, “I hope he is not offered a 45 percent pay cut.” The Yankees have no plans to negotiate with Jeter until after this season. (NYT)
895 2010-01-30 “Over the years, because of him, my circle of friends changed, I met people I never would have met; I came to see my whole life depending on this dog I hadn’t wanted at all. I’d expected having to walk him in the rain in the middle of the night. But I never expected to lose him. If ever you put a dog down, some of you goes with him.”

That the dogs died on the same weekend stunned the building’s residents and seemed to mark the end of an era, according to Harry Ahrens, a 62-year-old retiree and dog owner who took no umbrage at being referred to as Human Harry so as not to be confused with the other Harry.

“Losing those two longtime residents, it kind of reminds everybody of their own mortality,” he said. “They were a more pleasant part of the building’s culture than some of the people.” A doorman, Rafael Curbelo, a dog aficionado who kept a secret stash of treats behind his desk in the lobby, cried upon hearing the double dose of bad news. “Harry was my best friend here,” said Mr. Curbelo, recalling a dog named Johnny that his family had owned in Cuba. Losing Harry, he said, hurt more.

As has become the tradition in the dog-friendly building, where thick walls mute most barks and leashes can be optional for mature four-legged residents, two dog death announcements were posted in the elevator. Within hours, both had been inscribed with expressions of sympathy from tenants, some human, some not.

Tolstoy, a miniature dachshund with an apparently iffy disposition, was eloquent: “Dear Bix, I’m sorry I was so mean to you. If I had paid more attention to you and Harry, I would have learned to be a better dog. I’ll put you both in my next book. Love, Tolstoy.”

Both dogs died at home, surrounded by their human families, liberated by euthanasia from the irreversible infirmities of old age (Harry’s veterinary bills over the last three years ran to $25,000).

“It was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make,” said Stephanie Roesch, an account manager at Tzell Travel. “It broke my heart.”

Ms. Roesch, who lives with her cousin, Rita Silke, said they became Harry’s caretakers at his insistence: he initially belonged to her uncle, Tom Silke, who lived on the East Side but visited them almost daily, crossing the park with Harry in tow. “And one day, when Harry was about 2, he refused to go back across Central Park with my uncle,” she said. ”He wouldn’t budge,” she said.

On Tuesday night, Ms. Roesch and her cousin stopped by the Pennebaker-Hegedus apartment with a sheaf of dog photos and a bottle of Pol Roger.

Mr. Pennebaker told them it was Winston Churchill’s favorite Champagne.

They drank a toast to their dogs, gone but not really gone.

“I have a physicist friend who insists dogs would be talking and reading by now if they just lived longer,” Mr. Pennebaker mused. “I don’t think of Bix as a dog.”

He got no argument.
896 2010-01-30 The Chevron Corporation posted a 37 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit on Friday, missing analysts’ forecasts, as steep refinery losses offset gains from increases in oil prices and production.

Global refining margins have suffered in recent months as rising crude oil prices have driven up costs, even as the weak economy has reduced demand for gasoline and diesel fuel.

The weakness in Chevron’s refinery operations overshadowed a 9 percent increase in oil and gas output in the quarter, mostly from new and expanded projects that lifted its proven reserves by 1.1 billion barrels.

Chevron plans to increase spending off the coast of Western Australia this year; $3.5 billion of its $21.6 billion capital spending budget will go toward construction of its natural gas operations there.

Chevron said it earned $3.07 billion, or $1.53 a share in the quarter, down from $4.9 billion, or $2.44 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $48.7 billion from $45.2 billion.

The result fell short of the $1.70 a share expected by analysts and shares of Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., fell $1.12, or 1.53 percent, to close at $72.12.
897 2010-01-30 Barclays Capital asked a federal judge on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit contending that it improperly reaped a $5 billion windfall when it bought Lehman Brothers’ core banking operations during the 2008 financial crisis.

In a 325-page filing submitted early Friday, Barclays defended itself against accusations by the Lehman bankruptcy estate, denying that the sale was secretly structured to provide a huge payday without providing proper notice to the court.

The fight between the Lehman estate, now managed by the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, and Barclays revisits one of the darkest moments of the financial crisis. After Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008 — after Barclays withdrew as a potential buyer — Barclays returned and agreed to buy Lehman’s North American investment banking operations for about $1.5 billion.

When the Lehman estate filed its lawsuit in November, its lawyers at Jones Day pointed to a $5 billion gain that Barclays apparently realized when it marked up certain assets it had acquired through the sale. Lehman contends that the sale was represented to its board and to the bankruptcy court as a “wash.”

The Lehman estate, which is responsible for maximizing creditors’ recoveries, has asked the judge in the case, James M. Peck, to order the return of the assets and award punitive damages.
898 2010-01-30 It’s tempting to say that watching “A Family Is a Family Is a Family: A Rosie O’Donnell Celebration” is like drowning in a vat of syrup. But you could never actually drown in a vat of this program. Because it’s too shallow.

The 40-minute special, Sunday on HBO, consists of a parade of young children making cute, often inaccurate remarks about things like what “family” means, with an occasional song thrown in to break up the cloying monotony.

Ms. O’Donnell is listed as an executive producer, and her point, as might be expected, is that families come in all shapes and sizes: single-parent; two mothers; two fathers; mixed-race; adoptive. But the assumption is that this will be news to the viewer, an outlook that presumes that HBO subscribers have been living in caves for the last 30 years. Even adults for whom the idea of gay couples with children is repellent know that such families exist, and probably most children do as well.

Children are certainly the intended audience here; Ms. O’Donnell is trying to do for the image of “family” what Marlo Thomas did for stereotypes about boys and girls more than three decades ago with “Free to Be ... You & Me.” But, weirdly, the program tries to expand the definition of family by shoving all sorts of families into the same happy-and-prosperous mold.

The children here are all dressed for their school portrait, as it were: the image captured is adorable, but, unlike any given episode of “Sesame Street,” it reveals almost nothing about day-to-day realities and challenges.

The single-parent households have no financial troubles. The gay-parent families are never ostracized. The adopted children are all healthy and smart, because in Rosieland there are no disabled or emotionally troubled children languishing in the adoption system. In trying to celebrate diversity, the program gives us Stepford families.
899 2010-01-30 PARIS — French prosecutors will appeal the judgment clearing former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of complicity in an effort to tarnish his rival, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the Paris state prosecutor announced on Friday.

Mr. de Villepin accused Mr. Sarkozy of interfering with justice and ordering the appeal to pursue a personal vendetta. “This decision is a political decision, and what it shows is that Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the republic, prefers to persevere in his relentlessness, in his hatred, instead of assuming the responsibilities of his office,” Mr. de Villepin said.

The prosecution’s appeal, announced by Jean-Claude Marin, is likely to mean a rerun of the long, expensive and confusing trial into charges that Mr. de Villepin conspired with others to use forged documents to link Mr. Sarkozy to secret bank accounts supposedly holding money from arms-sales kickbacks.

“The court did not draw all the conclusions from all the elements contained in the investigation and heard during the trial, and part of the truth has yet to emerge,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. The prosecutor is supposed to act independently of the government, and the court’s decision on Thursday was without doubt a rebuke to the prosecution of the case, known as Clearstream.

Three other defendants were convicted in the case and will themselves appeal; Mr. Sarkozy said that as a plaintiff in the case, he would not appeal. Any retrial would be likely to take place toward the end of the year or early 2011, Mr. Marin said, arguing that since he believed that Mr. de Villepin was guilty, “How could I not appeal?”

But supporters of the former prime minister, who are known as Villepinistes and who belong to the ruling party, expressed anger over the decision to appeal the verdict. “Obviously, no one is fooled,” said a legislator, François Goulard. “It’s hypocrisy from the head of state.” He said he was disgusted, and added: “There is a real fear on the part of the head of state that Villepin is a rival and a rival who might threaten him tomorrow.”

905 2010-01-31 Peter Baker’s reference to President Bush’s prediction that if a Democrat won the election, “he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman,” shows Bush’s ignorance of history. Truman was ostracized and deemed politically ineffective because he went against public opinion and limited the Korean War with MacArthur’s firing. He in effect introduced us to the outside-the-box concept of “limited war,” which led to the concept of détente. What Bush did was make a pre-emptive attack on a tyrannical government for no known legitimate reason. Truman’s cause was justified by subsequent history, whereas Bush’s actions will have us scratching our heads 20 years hence. Bristol, Conn.

I propose a type of research that was not cited in Tom Dunkel’s article — probably because it doesn’t exist: a comparison study. The research I suggest would entail a group of participants on the Cenegenics program and comparable participants who are strongly motivated to engage in a program of weight training and aerobic exercise, combined with a highly nutritious diet and widely accepted supplements like vitamin D and fish oil.

My guess is that the outcome of the comparison would likely be close; participants in both groups would gain almost equally in strength, energy and standard health measures. If that were the case, however, then a question is raised: why take a high-return, high-risk program when there is a high-return, low-risk alternative? My suspicion is that the feel-well, look-well and do-well results of Cenegenics are available at little or no cost or risk to anyone who is willing to eat smart and work hard.

Wouldn’t providing men with H.C.G., a hormone from pregnant women, be analogous to giving women estrogen from pregnant horses? Over 40 years ago, Dr. Robert Wilson’s book “Feminine Forever” recommended estrogen for menopausal women, whom he called the equivalent of “castrates.” With little scientific evidence from drug companies and doctors, estrogen use increased until 13 million women were on some hormone-replacement therapy. Then the Women’s Health Initiative proved that the risks of such treatment well outweighed the benefits for most women. Are we so fearful of aging that what has been shown to be detrimental to one sex wasn’t even considered worth mentioning in an article about the other? Maplewood, N.J.

Although I don’t have medical training, it appears to me that the treatments mentioned in Tom Dunkel’s article are quite aggressive. I have had multiple sclerosis for 20 years, and I made significant changes in lifestyle and diet and adopted a rigorous exercise regime to manage my M.S. I achieved results similar to those of John Bellizzi, the man mentioned in the article: my weight went down 35 pounds, cholesterol level is normal, body fat 16 percent, resting pulse less than 60 and so forth. I’ll be 75 in a few months and will swim three hours to celebrate my birthday as I did when I was 70. And yes, I do take supplements. Although I know my approach is significantly different from Bellizzi’s, my philosophy is to try any method if and only if it is safe and inexpensive. What Bellizzi does not know are the long-term effects. Cincinnati

907 2010-01-31 The phrase “too big to fail” has entered into our everyday vocabulary. It carries the implication that really large, complex and highly interconnected financial institutions can count on public support at critical times. The sense of public outrage over seemingly unfair treatment is palpable. Beyond the emotion, the result is to provide those institutions with a competitive advantage in their financing, in their size and in their ability to take and absorb risks.

As things stand, the consequence will be to enhance incentives to risk-taking and leverage, with the implication of an even more fragile financial system. We need to find more effective fail-safe arrangements.

In approaching that challenge, we need to recognize that the basic operations of commercial banks are integral to a well-functioning private financial system. It is those institutions, after all, that manage and protect the basic payments systems upon which we all depend. More broadly, they provide the essential intermediating function of matching the need for safe and readily available depositories for liquid funds with the need for reliable sources of credit for businesses, individuals and governments.

Combining those essential functions unavoidably entails risk, sometimes substantial risk. That is why Adam Smith more than 200 years ago advocated keeping banks small. Then an individual failure would not be so destructive for the economy. That approach does not really seem feasible in today’s world, not given the size of businesses, the substantial investment required in technology and the national and international reach required.

Instead, governments have long provided commercial banks with the public “safety net.” The implied moral hazard has been balanced by close regulation and supervision. Improved capital requirements and leverage restrictions are now also under consideration in international forums as a key element of reform.

The further proposal set out by the president recently to limit the proprietary activities of banks approaches the problem from a complementary direction. The point of departure is that adding further layers of risk to the inherent risks of essential commercial bank functions doesn’t make sense, not when those risks arise from more speculative activities far better suited for other areas of the financial markets.

The specific points at issue are ownership or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, and proprietary trading — that is, placing bank capital at risk in the search of speculative profit rather than in response to customer needs. Those activities are actively engaged in by only a handful of American mega-commercial banks, perhaps four or five. Only 25 or 30 may be significant internationally.

Apart from the risks inherent in these activities, they also present virtually insolvable conflicts of interest with customer relationships, conflicts that simply cannot be escaped by an elaboration of so-called Chinese walls between different divisions of an institution. The further point is that the three activities at issue — which in themselves are legitimate and useful parts of our capital markets — are in no way dependent on commercial banks’ ownership. These days there are literally thousands of independent hedge funds and equity funds of widely varying size perfectly capable of maintaining innovative competitive markets. Individually, such independent capital market institutions, typically financed privately, are heavily dependent like other businesses upon commercial bank services, including in their case prime brokerage. Commercial bank ownership only tilts a “level playing field” without clear value added.

Very few of those capital market institutions, both because of their typically more limited size and more stable sources of finance, could present a credible claim to be “too big” or “too interconnected” to fail. In fact, sizable numbers of such institutions fail or voluntarily cease business in troubled times with no adverse consequences for the viability of markets.

What we do need is protection against the outliers. There are a limited number of investment banks (or perhaps insurance companies or other firms) the failure of which would be so disturbing as to raise concern about a broader market disruption. In such cases, authority by a relevant supervisory agency to limit their capital and leverage would be important, as the president has proposed.

To meet the possibility that failure of such institutions may nonetheless threaten the system, the reform proposals of the Obama administration and other governments point to the need for a new “resolution authority.” Specifically, the appropriately designated agency should be authorized to intervene in the event that a systemically critical capital market institution is on the brink of failure. The agency would assume control for the sole purpose of arranging an orderly liquidation or merger. Limited funds would be made available to maintain continuity of operations while preparing for the demise of the organization.

To help facilitate that process, the concept of a “living will” has been set forth by a number of governments. Stockholders and management would not be protected. Creditors would be at risk, and would suffer to the extent that the ultimate liquidation value of the firm would fall short of its debts.

To put it simply, in no sense would these capital market institutions be deemed “too big to fail.” What they would be free to do is to innovate, to trade, to speculate, to manage private pools of capital — and as ordinary businesses in a capitalist economy, to fail.

I do not deal here with other key issues of structural reform. Surely, effective arrangements for clearing and settlement and other restrictions in the now enormous market for derivatives should be agreed to as part of the present reform program. So should the need for a designated agency — preferably the Federal Reserve — charged with reviewing and appraising market developments, identifying sources of weakness and recommending action to deal with the emerging problems. Those and other matters are part of the administration’s program and now under international consideration.

In this country, I believe regulation of large insurance companies operating over many states needs to be reviewed. We also face a large challenge in rebuilding an efficient, competitive private mortgage market, an area in which commercial bank participation is needed. Those are matters for another day.

What is essential now is that we work with other nations hosting large financial markets to reach a broad consensus on an outline for the needed structural reforms, certainly including those that the president has recently set out. My clear sense is that relevant international and foreign authorities are prepared to engage in that effort. In the process, significant points of operational detail will need to be resolved, including clarifying the range of trading activity appropriate for commercial banks in support of customer relationships.

I am well aware that there are interested parties that long to return to “business as usual,” even while retaining the comfort of remaining within the confines of the official safety net. They will argue that they themselves and intelligent regulators and supervisors, armed with recent experience, can maintain the needed surveillance, foresee the dangers and manage the risks.

In contrast, I tell you that is no substitute for structural change, the point the president himself has set out so strongly.

I’ve been there — as regulator, as central banker, as commercial bank official and director — for almost 60 years. I have observed how memories dim. Individuals change. Institutional and political pressures to “lay off” tough regulation will remain — most notably in the fair weather that inevitably precedes the storm.

The implication is clear. We need to face up to needed structural changes, and place them into law. To do less will simply mean ultimate failure — failure to accept responsibility for learning from the lessons of the past and anticipating the needs of the future.
908 2010-01-31 A Toyota spokesman, Mike Michels, said the company planned an announcement “very soon” and would send letters to owners, but he said it could take several weeks for notices to arrive. Toyota wants owners to wait for the letters before taking their cars to dealerships for repair, he said.

Mr. Blackstock said he expected that dealers would be sent replacement accelerator pedals, which are produced for Toyota by CTS, a parts supplier based in Elkhart, Ind.

Also on Saturday, the traffic safety agency said it had opened an investigation into the manufacture of the accelerator pedals.

Last week, Toyota said it would temporarily stop production and sales of eight models at plants throughout the United States and Canada. The plants were scheduled to be closed for a week, beginning on Monday.

The recall also affects the Pontiac Vibe, which Toyota made until recently.

Toyota did not stop production or sales in Europe, because it said it had already devised and implemented a remedy there.

The recall for accelerator pedals affects 4.1 million cars worldwide. Toyota has also recalled an additional 5.4 million cars in the United States whose accelerator pedals could get stuck on floor mats. Some models are included in both recalls.

While some said the recalls have given a black eye to Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, and the second largest in the United States, its chief executive, Akio Toyoda, apologized Friday but said consumers should feel confident driving the company’s cars.

Some competitors have tried to capitalize on the troubles by offering trade-in deals to Toyota owners. But it was still unclear what effect the recalls might have on Toyota’s sales in the United States.

Edmunds.com, a Web site that provides car-buying advice, forecast that Toyota’s market share for January would fall to a four-year low. But AutoTrader.com, which tracks consumers’ shopping habits, said consideration of Toyota brands had actually risen during the last few days.

Mr. Blackstock, the California dealer, said he hoped that repairs could be completed quickly. He said he did not think the recalls would have a lasting effect on his business, or that of Toyota.

“If this is the worst thing that happens to us this year,” Mr. Blackstock said, “it should be a pretty good year.”
909 2010-01-31 Last year, more laid-off managers and executives grew tired of waiting for human resources departments to call them back. They took matters into their own hands by starting companies.

Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm, regularly keeps track of 3,000 high-level job seekers in a range of industries. Last year, 8.6 percent of these decided to take the start-up route, compared with 5.1 percent in 2008.

The biggest surge was in the third quarter. The hope is that this momentum “will carry into 2010, since new business development is considered critical to a sustainable recovery,” Challenger stated.

After seven years, only about a third of start-ups are still in business, according to a study in the Monthly Labor Review. Most of these companies fail within in the first few years. So in four years or so, it would be interesting to see how many of these entrepreneurs wish they had waited for that H.R. person to call back.
910 2010-01-31 China's National People's Congress is expected to consider banning a centuries-old culinary tradition: the consumption of dog and cat meat.

The Times of London reports that a proposed law calls for imposing fines, jail time or both for anyone caught eating or selling dog or cat meat. Dog meat is also known as “fragrant meat” and is thought to boost energy and male virility. It’s also a delicacy. “I hear a lot of people saying dog shouldn’t be eaten,” one worker at the Wan Family Dog Meat Restaurant in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, told The Times. “But here in Guizhou, dog meat is a famous traditional dish. It’s a stew and very delicious.”
911 2010-01-31 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Three missiles believed to have been fired from American drones killed 15 militants in North Waziristan late Friday night, Pakistani security officials said Saturday. The target of the strike was a compound in the Mamad Khel area of North Waziristan, the officials said.

Four Arab and two ethnic Uzbek fighters were killed, along with local militants, a security official said. Four militants were wounded.

Drone attacks in the region have increased significantly since the Dec. 30 suicide bombing attack at a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan’s North Waziristan region. Seven Americans and a Jordanian were killed in that attack.

American officials say North Waziristan is the main haven for militants from Al Qaeda and for the Afghan Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. He is closely allied with the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, who claimed responsibility for the Khost bombing.

Drone attacks are controversial in Pakistan, whose officials argue publicly that the attacks violate their sovereignty. Privately those officials do not oppose the strikes, which many United States officials say have been effective in weakening the Taliban and Al Qaeda by killing many of their senior leaders.

Separately, at least 16 people were killed Saturday and dozens wounded in a suicide attack on a checkpoint in the main market of Khar, the capital of the Bajaur tribal area, according to local residents and Pakistani news reports.
912 2010-01-31 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti  After two weeks of often chaotic food distribution, the United Nations announced plans on Saturday for a coupon-based system that aims to give rice to 10,000 Haitians a day at each of 16 locations around Port-au-Prince.

The new program  with the first coupons delivered Saturday, and food to be distributed Sunday  ends what officials described as the “quick and dirty” initial phase of emergency response, but it is also an admission of what Haitians were saying for days: that the system failed to reach those who needed it and was often exploited by those it did reach. Meanwhile, the suspension by the United States military of evacuations of injured earthquake victims entered its fourth day on Saturday, with state and federal governments offering conflicting reasons for the suspension, even as they sought ways to resume the flights.

Also Saturday, Haitian authorities confirmed the arrest of 10 Americans for trying to take 33 children out of the country in what authorities said was an illicit adoption scheme.

The food giveaways, which began with little trouble after the earthquake, have devolved into blood sport as day after day, trucks ran out of food before long lines of people were served. In a few cases, aid workers protected by only a few police officers were overrun by thousands of Haitians, as men with muscular arms stampeded children and reached beyond barriers to grab what they could.

In other cases, United Nations troops have resorted to tear gas and warning shots, followed by a quick escape before they could hand out all of the food.

Marcus Prior, a spokesman for the United Nations World Food Program, said the new effort aimed to bring distribution back under control. “It’s a unique response to a unique situation,” he told reporters at a news conference here in the capital. “We need to stabilize the food supply.”

Over the next 15 days, Mr. Prior said, aid groups and United Nations workers will go into neighborhoods and distribute coupons that allow each family to receive a single 55-pound bag of rice. A similar coupon system has been in place for about a week at some of the smaller tent camps  for instance, on the lawn of the prime minister’s office, where the German Red Cross gives out food twice a day.

And generally, the system has worked in these areas  with some shoving, but mostly order.

At a United Nations office in Carrefour on Saturday, aid workers from Save the Children handed out 709 coupons  each dated and signed  to an elected representative from two adjacent districts of Port-au-Prince, Martissant 8 and 9. The Martissant official, Samuel Saint Jean, said he had a team of 15 people who would go house to house Saturday evening to hand out one coupon to each family.

“I have a list,” he said. “They are all victims of the earthquake.”

Mr. Prior said American and United Nations troops would provide security when the food was given out. In another effort to keep the giveaways calm, he said, only women would be allowed to collect the rice, though they could have family members help them carry it.

A Florida official said that on Wednesday, shortly after Gov. Charlie Crist asked the federal government to coordinate flight plans for critically injured Haitians and shoulder some of the costs, which he said were in the millions of dollars, the state was informed that the airlift had been suspended.

Military officials said Friday that the flights had been stopped because of a dispute between Florida hospitals about the payment and a lack of capacity.

On Saturday, the military appeared to back away from that assertion.

“For us to do our mission, it’s obvious we have to have a destination to fly them to,” said Capt. Kevin Aandahl, a spokesman for the United States Transportation Command. “The capability exists, it’s just a matter of getting all the right people on the chain all lined up.”

In a statement on Saturday, Governor Crist said that “at no time has Florida closed our doors to those impacted by the earthquake in Haiti.”

The problem, said John Cherry, a spokesman for Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, was the “lack of coordinated response from the federal government.”

“We don’t know who’s in charge,” he said. “They take it up their chain, and it seems like things are going to a black hole.”

The 10 arrested Americans, 5 men and 5 women, were stopped at the Dominican border on Friday night after the police conducted a routine search of their vehicle, Haiti’s social affairs minister, Yves Cristalin, said. She said the suspects had no documents to prove they had cleared the adoption of the children, aged 2 months to 12 years, and no papers showing they were orphans.

One of the suspects, Laura Sillsby, who said she was the leader of an Idaho-based charity called New Life Children’s Refuge, denied they had done anything wrong. A Baptist minister “asked us to take the children to the orphanage in the Dominican Republic,” she told Reuters from a jail cell in Port-au-Prince.
913 2010-01-31 By highlighting the defensive nature of the buildup, the administration was hoping to avoid a sharp response from Tehran.

Military officials said that the countries that accepted the defense systems were , the , and . They said the Kuwaitis had agreed to take the defensive weapons to supplement older, less capable models it has had for years. and Israel have long had similar equipment of their own.

General Petraeus has declined to say who was taking the American equipment, probably because many countries in the gulf region are hesitant to be publicly identified as accepting American military aid and the troops that come with it. In fact, the names of countries where the antimissile systems are deployed are classified, but many of them are an open secret.

The general spoke about the deployments at a conference at the Institute for the Study of War here on Jan. 22, saying that “Iran is clearly seen as a very serious threat by those on the other side of the gulf front.”

General Petraeus said that the acceleration of defensive systems — which began when President was in office — included “eight Patriot missile batteries, two in each of four countries.” Patriot missiles are capable of shooting down short-range offensive missiles.

He also described a first line of defense: He said the United States was now keeping Aegis cruisers on patrol in the Persian Gulf at all times. Those cruisers are equipped with advanced radar and antimissile systems designed to intercept medium-range missiles. Those systems would not be useful against Iran’s long-range missile, the Shahab 3, but intelligence agencies believe that it will be years before Iran can solve the problems of placing a nuclear warhead atop that missile.

Iran contends that it is not trying to develop , and that its program is for energy production. The White House declined to comment on the deployments.

But administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the moves have several aims. “Our first goal is to deter the Iranians,” said one senior administration official. “A second is to reassure the Arab states, so they don’t feel they have to go nuclear themselves. But there is certainly an element of calming the Israelis as well.”

As proceeds — more slowly, American intelligence officials say, than the United States had once thought — Israel has hinted at various times that it might take military action against the country’s military facilities unless it is convinced that Mr. Obama and Western allies are succeeding in stopping the program.

Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Gen. , took an unannounced trip to Israel this month, partly to take the temperature of the Israeli government and to review both economic and covert programs now under way against the Iranian program, according to officials familiar with the meeting.

American officials argue that the willingness of Arab states to take the American emplacements, which usually come with a small deployment of American soldiers to operate, maintain and protect the equipment, illustrates the region’s growing unease about Iran’s ambitions and abilities.

Gulf countries are also taking steps of their own to harden their defenses. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought more than $15 billion in American arms in the past two years, including missile defense systems. The United States is helping support a plan by Saudi Arabia to triple the size, to 30,000 people, of a Saudi force that protects the kingdom’s ports, oil facilities and water-desalinization plants, a senior military officer said. The reported both steps on its Web site on Saturday.

One senior military officer said that General Petraeus had started talking openly about the Patriot deployments about a month ago, when it became increasingly clear that international efforts toward imposing sanctions against Iran faced hurdles, and the administration’s efforts to engage Iran were being rebuffed by the Tehran government. In October, the two countries reached an agreement in principle to move a significant portion of Iran’s nuclear fuel out of the country, but Iran backed away from the deal.

In discussing the Patriots and missile-shooting ships, General Petraeus’s main message has been to reassure allies in the gulf that the United States is committed to helping defend the region, said the military officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the topic. But the general’s remarks were also a pointed reminder to the Iranians of American resolve, the officer said.
914 2010-01-31 When Henin held serve to go up, 1-0, in the third set, Williams looked at her racket, and gave it and herself a talking-to.

“I thought I was just giving her too many points,” Williams said. “She was playing well, but I knew I could play better so I literally told myself, ‘I need to man up.’ ”

Williams leaned on her big, deadly and accurate serve to dish out 12 aces, then broke Henin’s serve three straight games and left little doubt that she was the best women’s tennis player in the world right now.

A couple of others emerged as winners from Rod Laver Arena.

Henin, for one. Her second tournament since returning to tennis after a 20-month retirement went almost perfectly. A wild-card entry, Henin was the emotional touchstone. Williams suggested that having Henin back, and defeating her, made this title a little more precious. And Henin was happy to be back.

“I felt like we both were out there trying to kind of prove something,” said Williams, who was fined $92,000 for losing her temper during a semifinal match at last year’s United States Open. “I think we both did at the end of the day.”

Henin rediscovered the magic that propelled her to seven Grand Slam titles. She matched shots and grit with the champion in ways Williams said she had not seen of late.

“As you saw today, she took me to the umpteenth level,” Williams said. “She clearly hasn’t, like, lost a step at all since she’s been gone. So I feel like I played a girl who’s been on the tour for the past five years without a break. I think her game is definitely better. I mean, it was excellent before she left. But, you know, I think she’s added a lot to it.”

The biggest winner perhaps was the women’s game. The last time a Grand Slam women’s final went three sets was at Wimbledon in 2006, when Henin lost to Amélie Mauresmo. Henin’s return, as well as that of her fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters, puts some heat on Williams and adds sizzle to the sport. Clijsters won the 2009 United States Open after taking time off to have a child.

Henin, 27, is seeking a career Grand Slam of her own, and will aim for it at Wimbledon this summer. In addition to 2006, she made the final there in 2001, losing to Venus Williams, a five-time Wimbledon winner. Serena Williams is the defending champion.

On the strength of her performance here, Henin has to be among the favorites to win her fifth French Open.

“Winning big tournaments — that’s my motivation,” Henin said, sounding much like Serena Williams.

Other players with major titles could find their way to the top of the rankings. Svetlana Kuznetsova won last year’s French Open to go with her 2004 United States Open title. And Maria Sharapova, who was upset in the first round here, has won Wimbledon and the Australian and United States Opens, and is capable of big performances.

Some intriguing talent entered the picture here when Li Na and Zheng Jie made the semifinals, the first time two Chinese players advanced to the semifinals in singles at the same Grand Slam tournament.

For now, however, the world’s No. 1 ranking belongs to Williams.

The American twins Bob and Mike Bryan won the doubles title by defeating Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3. The top-seeded Bryans, with eight Grand Slam doubles titles, have taken four of the past five Australian championships.
915 2010-01-31 Emily Bette Scharfman and David Menchel are to be married Sunday in Lawrence, N.Y. Rabbi Jordan D. Rosenberg will perform the ceremony at Temple Israel of Lawrence.

The bride, 27, will be taking her husband’s surname. She is an associate in the insolvency division of the Los Angeles law firm Latham & Watkins. She works in the firm’s Manhattan office, where she met the bridegroom, 31, who had been an associate until March in its mergers and acquisitions unit. They received their law degrees from New York University.

The bride graduated cum laude from Yale and is the daughter of Dr. Rochelle L. Chaiken of New Rochelle, N.Y., and the late Dr. Edward L. Scharfman. Her mother, an endocrinologist, is a vice president of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in Manhattan, for which she manages a group that provides support for the medicines that the company sells in the developing world. The bride’s father was a psychiatrist and psychopharmacologist and an associate chief of psychiatry for a clinic in Little Neck, Queens, of the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services. He had a private practice in Hartsdale, N.Y.

The bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and is a son of Beatrice J. Menchel and Rabbi Gary Menchel of West Hempstead, N.Y. The bridegroom’s mother teaches Judaic studies at the Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls in Hewlett Bay Park, N.Y., a part of the Hebrew Academy of Long Beach. His father is the principal of Yeshiva Har Torah, a private elementary school in Little Neck.
916 2010-01-31 “Earth” is part of a five-piece cycle Ms. Chen began working on three years ago. (She has already explored water, for which Mr. Chenoweth also composed music, and fire; next she plans to tackle metal and wood.)

“Earth” has special significance this year, she said, alluding to the Chinese calendar. “This is the Year of the Tiger, and tigers are a very strong, earthy animal.”

Mr. Chenoweth, of Princeton, created the music for “Earth” on his computer, a process that he said afforded certain advantages. “Nai-Ni’s choreography will expand in certain areas or contract in others — she’ll say, ‘I need 45 seconds here’ — and the editing is very easy,” he said.

The music, which will be played from a CD for the Newark shows but may later be expanded to include a live percussionist, is “almost entirely percussion, a lot of gongs and cymbals,” said Mr. Chenoweth, 66. “It doesn’t sound like traditional Chinese music, though I’ve used some of the instruments.”

In the group’s recent rehearsal at the Harlem School of the Arts, eight of the troupe’s 10 members practiced a traditional Chinese folk dance. Four women whirled sequined scarlet scarves and bright pink silk fans while their male counterparts leapt athletically around and between them.

“They need the practice for this one,” Ms. Chen explained, as recorded music played and a coach shouted cues. “A lot of them didn’t major in traditional dance in college.”

Neither did Ms. Chen. She started dancing as a 4-year-old in Taiwan, and later trained there in ballet and folk dance before attending a performance arts school whose curriculum included modern dance, jazz and Chinese martial arts. While enrolled there, she joined the Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan, spending three years with the company. In 1982, she enrolled at New York University.

“After I came to the States I was more focused on curating dance,” she said. “My major was not just performance. It was education and choreography.”

Ms. Chen said that after N.Y.U. she thought, “I love to perform, but would that satisfy me as an artist, just doing the work of Western culture?”

Eventually she concluded that “my thirst for expressing myself, both East and West, could only happen through creating my own company.”

Four of Ms. Chen’s dancers are based near her home in Fort Lee, where she lives with her husband, Andy Chiang, the company’s executive director, and their daughter, Sylvia, 14. The rest live mainly in New York, and their backgrounds are varied. “One is from China, one is from Taiwan, one is from South Korea, one is from upstate New York,” Ms. Chen said.

What they share is respect for the many forms of expression through movement.

“This is my first season, and I knew nothing about Chinese before I started,” said Nijawwon Matthews, 23, of Fort Lee, who is black. “I’ve danced with a lot of companies, but this was a brand-new experience for me.

“One thing I’ve learned is that Chinese dance comes from a let-go place,” he said during a break in rehearsal. “You have to be incredibly detailed and athletic, but it also takes you to a place in your imagination. It’s made me humble. I’ve learned to be humble.”
917 2010-01-31 In September, the student government sent a letter to the faculty questioning whether professors were being overzealous in applying the policy. And last month, The Daily Princetonian denounced the policy in an editorial, saying it had “too many harmful consequences that outweigh the good intentions behind the system.”

The undergraduate student body president, Connor Diemand-Yauman, a senior from Chesterland, Ohio, said: “I had complaints from students who said that their professors handed back exams and told them, ‘I wanted to give 10 of you A’s, but because of the policy, I could only give five A’s.’ When students hear that, an alarm goes off.”

Nancy Weiss Malkiel, dean of the undergraduate college at Princeton, said the policy was not meant to establish such grade quotas, but to set a goal: Over time and across all academic departments, no more than 35 percent of grades in undergraduate courses would be A-plus, A or A-minus.

Early on, Dr. Malkiel sent 3,000 letters explaining the change to admissions officers at graduate schools and employers across the country, and every transcript goes out with a statement about the policy. But recently, the university administration has been under pressure to do more. So it created a question-and-answer booklet that it is now sending to many of the same graduate schools and employers.

Princeton also studied the effects on admissions rates to top medical schools and law schools, and found none. While the number of graduates securing jobs in finance or consulting dropped to 169 last year from 249 in 2008 and 194 in 2004, the university attributed the falloff to the recession. (Each graduating class has about 1,100 students.)

But the drop in job placements, whatever the cause, has fueled the arguments of those opposed to the policy. The grading change at Princeton was prompted by the creep of A’s, which accelerated in the 1990s, and the wildly divergent approaches to grading across disciplines. Historically, students in the natural sciences were graded far more rigorously, for example, than their classmates in the humanities, a gap that has narrowed but that still exists.

Some students respect the tougher posture. “What people don’t realize is that grades at different schools always have different meanings, and people at Goldman Sachs or the Marshall Scholarship have tons of experience assessing different G.P.A.’s,” said Jonathan Sarnoff, a sophomore who sits on the editorial board of The Daily Princetonian. “A Princeton G.P.A. is different from the G.P.A. at the College of New Jersey down the road.”

Faye Deal, the associate dean for admissions and financial aid at Stanford Law School, said she had read Princeton’s literature on the policy and continued “to view Princeton candidates in the same fashion — strong applicants with excellent preparation.”

Goldman Sachs, one of the most sought-after employers, said it did not apply a rigid G.P.A. cutoff. “Princeton knows that; everyone knows that,” said Gia Morón, a company spokeswoman, explaining that recruiters consider six “core measurements,” including achievement, leadership and commercial focus.

“There are tons of really great schools with really smart kids applying for the same jobs,” said Jacob Loewenstein, a junior from Lawrence, N.Y., who is majoring in German. “People intuitively take a G.P.A. to be a representation of your academic ability and act accordingly. The assumption that a recruiter who is screening applications is going to treat a Princeton student differently based on a letter is naïve.”

Stuart Rojstaczer, a retired professor at Duke who maintains a Web site dedicated to exposing grade inflation, said that Princeton’s policy was “something that other institutions can easily emulate, and should emulate, but will not.” For now, Princeton and its students are still the exception. “If that means we’re out in a leadership position and, in a sense, in a lonelier position, then we’re prepared to do that,” Dr. Malkiel said. “We’re quite confident that what we have done is right.”
918 2010-01-31 Emily Sullivan Colahan, a daughter of Jane Hawkins Colahan and Peter D. Colahan of Rye, N.Y., was married Saturday to Craig Lewis Cerone Jr., a son of Jane M. Cerone and Mr. Cerone Sr. of Ridgefield, Conn. The Rev. Susan McKnight performed the ceremony at the Warren United Church in Warren, Vt.

The couple met at Colgate, from which they graduated, she magna cum laude.

Mrs. Cerone, 25, teaches sixth-grade language arts at Bedford Middle School in Westport, Conn. She received a master’s in English education from Columbia.

Until 2007, her father was the president of Colahan Saunders, a graphic arts firm that was in Long Island City, Queens.

Mr. Cerone, 26, is a trader at C. R. Intrinsic Investors, a hedge fund in Stamford, Conn.

His mother is an occupational therapist at Scotland Elementary School in Ridgefield, Conn. His father works in Greenwich, Conn., as a managing director in the securities unit of Deutsche Bank.
919 2010-01-31 Lyle Girandola, 50, soon appears out of the woods at the back of the field, a misty figure pushing a wheelbarrow with a wrought-iron firepot to keep the subs warm on the sideline.

Anthony Costa, 54, arrives on his bike after Mass at St. David the King, which makes Mr. Lupo look bad because he tells his wife, Carolyn, that he has to miss church because of the game. H. Fenster, 47, drives the farthest, about 35 minutes from Hillsborough. Everyone brings both their red and blue jerseys since Mr. Lupo keeps it a secret what team they’ll be on until game time.

“Andy has his black-box formula for picking teams,” said Karl Dentino, 53, a marketing executive. His goal is to make teams that are so balanced each week, the game ends in a tie. About half of them do.

The league is called 12 Again, because for two sweet hours each Sunday morning that’s how these middle-aged men feel. “By Sunday afternoon I’m limping around the house pretty good,” Mr. Lupo said.

“I play Sunday, I can’t lift my arm until Thursday,” said Steve Tosches, 53, a quarterback, who coached Princeton’s football team for many years.

“We’re afraid the game will end when someone drops dead,” Mr. Light said.

“That’s why I have this,” said Mr. Lupo, throwing open his trunk, and waving a defibrillator high in the air.

The game’s longevity is in part because of subtle concessions to age. They used to count three Mississippis before rushing. “Then four, then five, now six,” Mr. Light said. “We need more time to get places.”

In their 30s, they’d argue about players rushing the quarterback too soon. But in their 50s they don’t need the aggravation, so Mr. Hayon brings a stopwatch that buzzes when it’s O.K. to rush.

Mr. Obus, 63, an investment manager, says as they age the game gets more like chess. “You don’t just say, ‘Go long.’ We can’t do that anymore. You have to flood a zone. You come up with more complex plays, more paths.”

It makes huddles interminable. “People say, ‘Why do you spend so much time in the huddle?’ ” Mr. Lupo said. “By the time you tell the seventh guy what to do, the first guy forgot what he’s supposed to do.”

There’s no blocking, no tagging hard (“everyone’s got back problems,” Mr. Lupo said), and fumbles are dead balls.

“Our motto is, ‘Monday morning we all need to go to work,’ ” Mr. Lupo said.

When the game started in 1990, they were lucky to have six players. Mr. Lupo and Alan Slepman, the league’s first commissioner, went through backyards, shouting, “Lyle, is this your house, can you play today?”

“It got easier with cellphones,” Mr. Lupo said.

Mr. Dentino, who jogged by one day and joined the game, brought in his neighbor Mr. Girandola, who brought in his neighbor Jerry Fields, 53, who brought in Jonathan Sabin, 42. By the mid-1990s, they had the opposite problem, too many wanting to play, and some not understanding the thin line between worthy competitor and inglourious basterd. “A lot of people claim they’re good guys and they’re really not,” Mr. Lupo said.

They needed men who were athletic, but not too. Scott Brunner, the former Giants quarterback, played for a few weeks. “Oh, my God, he threw too hard,” Mr. Lupo said. “The ball kept bouncing off guys’ chests. People kept running out of the way.

“We’re not looking for the great triathlete. If your wife is saying: ‘What, are you crazy? At your age?’ That’s the guy we want.”

Those wives. In the early years when the kids were young, it was harder. The men were working all week, then gone Sunday morning, too?

“My wife was a little bit on my back,” Mr. Light said. “I was taking away our Sundays. She didn’t get it.” But after 10 or 15 years, he wore her down.

“I know nothing about football,” Susan Light said. “After the game, he gives me the play by play. I say that’s great or that’s too bad — I can just tell if it’s positive or negative. The big thing — he’s happy and calmer after he plays, so I’m happy.”

There’s a final element every sports classic needs, a legend, a Gipper, a Bambino. For the 12 Again league, it’s Mr. Slepman, the first commissioner, and by all accounts, a quippy, civic-minded, big-hearted guy who taught Mr. Lupo everything he knows about running a Sunday touch football league for slow old men. In October 2001, Mr. Slepman, a banker, collapsed on the commuter train home from Manhattan. He had a brain tumor, and on Jan. 13, 2003, he died. Every 12 Again player attended his funeral. Mr. Slepman was buried in his blue jersey and today the town field they play on is named for him.

But that’s only half the legend. Nine months later, a single dad from Boston moved next door to the Slepman home. Shortly after, Mr. Lupo recruited him to the game.

“He seemed to have the right personality,” Mr. Lupo said, “a friendly, mild temperament.” When Mr. Lupo asked the man from Boston if he’d ever played organized football, the man answered no, and Mr. Lupo said, “You’re perfect for us.”

That was Mr. Hayon, the educational testing executive. And two years after replacing Mr. Slepman on the field — not that anyone could truly replace Mr. Slepman, of course — Mr. Hayon married Mr. Slepman’s widow, Holly. When she is asked if her second husband’s love for the same Sunday morning football game had anything to do with it, she said, “It didn’t hurt.”

On a recent Sunday at Alan Slepman Football Field, Mr. Hayon, playing for the red team, caught two passes, made two interceptions and wore the stopwatch around his neck to monitor the pass rush.

Once again, Mr. Lupo’s black-box formulas worked — with one play left in the game and the blue team 20 yards from the goal, the score was tied, 2-2. An icy rain fell as Mr. Fenster, an accounts manager who puts in 60-hour weeks when he’s not quarterbacking the blues, dropped back to pass. He thought of tossing the ball blindly to the back of the end zone. “Sometimes they bat it around and you might get lucky,” he’d say later.

Instead, he saw his teammate Mr. Light cutting across the front of the end zone and threw. Steve Honig, floating on pass defense for the reds, raced in front of Mr. Light, intercepted the ball and streaked downfield with no one near him.

Asked later what he was thinking as he ran toward the end zone, Mr. Honig, 50, the president of an insurance third-party administrator, said: “Wow! That’s all I was thinking. Wow!”
920 2010-01-31 It was the movie “Hotel for Dogs” that sealed the deal. My kids had been asking for a dog for years, promising to take care of it, arguing how our family wouldn’t be complete until we had one. But after we rented that movie, in which humans can’t really find happiness without a canine pal, our kids became inconsolable in their dogless sorrow. Moaning, wailing — you’d have thought they severed an artery. Fine, we’ll get a dog. Yay, Dad!

Truth be told, I was almost as excited as they were. Dogs are a lot of work, but they can be delightful little balls of joy and fun as well, and who wouldn’t want more of that in the house? After some not very careful screening, we came across a dog online that needed a home: a little Yorkshire terrier that had bounced around a bit. We met with the latest owners at a Petco in the Minneapolis suburbs. Officially, we were there just to meet the dog and see if he was a good fit, but once the kids saw the thing, there was little doubt he was getting in our minivan.

As we drove, I successfully lobbied to name the dog Dave, since I’ve gotten along really well with every human I’ve known by that name. We brought him home, and the kids were over the moon with joy. Dave put up with all the handling, even the ham-fisted affections of the 1-year-old. He slept on my 8-year-old-son’s bed, just the way my boy had always dreamed. All was right.

Until the next day, when I came home from work, at which point the dog started barking his head off. He cowered; he growled. Same thing happened when I wrestled with the kids or chased them or even danced with them. (He may have had a point with my dancing.) I tried yelling at him to hush. I tried slipping him some bacon as I came in, and he barely accepted it, even though it’s bacon, and he’s a dog. He ate it, and then he barked at me some more.

On the one hand, it was kind of funny. But the dog’s hate/fear actually did kind of hurt my feelings. The one thing you expect from your dog is unconditional love and tail wags at the end of the day. There’s something kind of heartbreaking about coming home from work, from providing the income to make the house function, and being hated and feared when you walk in the door.

So I thought maybe he was beaten up by a man at some point, right? But male friends would come over, friends who look like me, and Dave would be fine. It was just me. My dog hated me.
921 2010-01-31 My husband and I practice polyamory, a k a ethical nonmonogamy. We are open about this to friends but are unsure what to disclose to others. Our housekeeper might have seen me in bed with my boyfriend. Must I explain? When I travel for business, I sometimes take my boyfriend. Must I fill in a co-worker I see only occasionally? I don’t want to hide my affection for my boyfriend or make anyone uncomfortable. NAME WITHHELD, SAN FRANCISCO

You have no duty to decode your connubial arrangements for mere acquaintances. Nor need you make them feel comfortable or reassure them that their views on marriage and monogamy are universally held.

But if you choose to relieve their consternation, you might be guided by the advice of a polyamorous friend who, speaking of similar situations, told me via e-mail: “I figure the best policy is to behave as if nothing inappropriate is happening. My feeling is that the best way to make other people comfortable is to act as comfortable as possible.” It seems that you are also mindful of your own tranquillity, a reasonable thing but not a matter of ethics, which is something more concerned with the effect of our actions on others.

There are two other people who are strongly affected here: your husband and your boyfriend. Their reputations could be sullied by folks who misconstrue your situation. You should discuss with those two how much they’d like you to disclose. As to your housekeeper, my friend says, “That’s tricky when you think someone may have seen you in bed, because even a monogamous couple might feel a little awkward about that.” Indeed. That’s why God created doors. That close. And lock. It is also possible to obtain something called a “calendar” on which you can record the dates when your housekeeper is expected, dates when you can deploy that “door.”

Our small nonprofit, the Opportunity Fund for Developing Countries, offers scholarships to African boys and girls who agree to keep up their grades, stay out of trouble and refrain from pregnancy. When a 20-year-old orphan we’ve supported for many years had a baby, we revoked her scholarship. (Significantly, we have never dropped a male’s scholarship for impregnating a female.) Now she wants to return to school. We’d like to readmit her to our program, but won’t that set a precedent? DEB DAY OLIVIER, SALT LAKE CITY

To restore this girl’s scholarship may well set a precedent, and I think it should. As you seem to realize, to apply this rule only to one sex is strikingly unfair and violates your own agreement with the students. What’s needed is a new policy, one with a better response to young people’s lives than “just say no babies.”

By definition, nobody welcomes an unwanted pregnancy. As Cynthia Lloyd, an authority on population and education issues and a lead author of the book “Growing Up Global: The Changing Transitions to Adulthood in Developing Countries,” put it in an e-mail exchange, “Obviously in Africa, many young women who get pregnant have not necessarily made that choice willingly or with any control.” I admire your wish to help these students avoid obstacles to education, like too-early parenthood, but I admire even more your reluctance to let an imperfect policy inflexibly applied thwart a young woman’s desire for an education and a better life.

What form should that new policy take? Here I defer to educators and experts in family planning. Lloyd suggests one that you might consult: Codou Diaw, executive director of the Forum for African Women Educationalists, an N.G.O. operating throughout the continent from its headquarters in Nairobi.

When you restore this girl’s scholarship, as I hope you will, you can announce your intention to change course. It is commendable to gauge how effectively your policies serve your ends, and to amend or abandon those that are ineffectual.

UPDATE: Olivier told me by e-mail that they did not continue this girl’s scholarship but that she may reapply next year.
