926 2010-02-01 In an editorial in The New York Times, Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, describes how the financial system should be changed in order to avert another disastrous collapse....
927 2010-02-01 He also wrote and illustrated a series of children’s books starring Sally, a Labrador retriever. Among them is “Sally Goes to the Beach” (Abrams, 2000), which appeared briefly on the New York Times children’s best-seller list.

He was the subject of a book, “The Art of Stephen Huneck” (Abrams, 2004), by Laura Beach.

Mr. Huneck’s masterwork was the Dog Chapel, which he began building in 1997. It sits on Dog Mountain, a vast park-like space he and his wife owned near St. Johnsbury. Dog Mountain, which is open to the public at no charge, includes a gallery, hiking trails and an agility course for dogs.

Small, modest and white, the chapel resembles a 19th-century New England church from the outside, apart from the steeple topped by a winged Labrador. A sign proclaims: “Welcome: All Creeds, All Breeds. No Dogmas Allowed.”

Inside, the four pews, handmade by Mr. Huneck, are supported by carved wooden dogs. Stained-glass windows depict dogs in various poses. The walls are almost entirely covered with handwritten notes to departed pets, placed there by grieving visitors.

“I’ve learned so much more about love from my dogs than I ever did from my parents or the church,” Mr. Huneck told The Chicago Tribune in 1997. “They’re really great teachers. They love you with their whole heart.”

Stephen Huneck was born on Oct. 8, 1948, in Columbus, Ohio, and reared in Sudbury, Mass. (The family name is pronounced HYOO-neck.) Severely dyslexic and unhappy in a home he described afterward as turbulent, he left at 17 “with 33 cents in his pocket,” his wife said.

Mr. Huneck later studied at the Massachusetts College of Art, before becoming an antiques dealer. Through repairing wooden pieces, he taught himself how to carve. In 1984, one of his original carvings caught the eye of a New York dealer, and he was soon making art full time.

In addition to his wife, the former Gwendolyn Ide, Mr. Huneck is survived by his parents, five sisters and a brother.

Two books written and illustrated by Mr. Huneck, “Sally’s Great Balloon Adventure” and “Even Bad Dogs Go to Heaven,” are scheduled to be published by Abrams this year.

Of Mr. Huneck’s network of galleries, only the one on Dog Mountain remains. The fate of Dog Mountain, the chapel and the gallery is uncertain, Ms. Huneck said. But with the renewed demand for her husband’s work that his death has engendered, she said, she was able to hire back most of the employees let go last month.

944 2010-02-01 In the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal, insurers are being inundated with inquiries from corporations seeking to protect their investments, their brands and even their sales when their celebrity endorsers suffer public embarrassment.

Many companies take out death and disability insurance to cover themselves in the event that an athlete or celebrity endorser dies or is injured while under contract. In a new wrinkle, more companies are trying to insure against the potential loss of sales when an athlete product endorser is involved in a scandal.

“Companies are saying if it could happen to Tiger Woods, it could happen to anyone,” said Brian Socolow, a lawyer who runs the sports practice at Loeb & Loeb, which represents athletes and companies in sponsorship deals. “For some companies, it’s a tremendous investment, and when it goes bad, it is not only the loss of investment, it’s a black eye for the company.”

Dan Trueman, who runs the enterprise risk department at R J Kiln & Company, the managing agent for Lloyd’s, said his firm had seen an eightfold increase in inquiries into this type of insurance between September and December, the bulk from pharmaceutical and financial service companies. “It’s more than just the flavor of the week,” he said.

Calculating the amount to insure against is not easy. Insurers said they based their assumptions on how much revenue grew after an athlete or celebrity became a company endorser. In some cases, the cause and effect is direct — for example, in the case of signature Tiger Woods golf shirts sold by Nike. But companies that employ athletes or celebrities for more generic brand building are now also looking for financial protection.
945 2010-02-01 The Swiss are in a bind. A Swiss court has barred the government in Bern from complying with an agreement to provide the United States I.R.S. with the names and records of 4,450 Americans suspected of evading taxes by hiding their millions at the Swiss bank UBS.

The court ruled that the disclosure contravened Swiss bank secrecy law. The government has now concluded that it can hand over only about 250 files.

The Swiss government has to fix the problem. Its negotiators, we presume, understood Swiss law when they signed the deal with Washington last August.

Bern has now suggested that the Internal Revenue Service ease Switzerland’s political problems by revealing to Swiss authorities the names of UBS account holders who have voluntarily turned themselves in (some 15,000 American evaders came clean after an amnesty was offered last year), so they can figure out which of the 4,450 are already known.

That is a nonstarter. Combing through the 15,000 cases would further delay a process that has already taken far too long.

The Swiss are in this bind because they have built a banking system based on tax evasion. UBS employed particularly egregious tactics. Its operatives were caught as they solicited business among wealthy clients in the United States, promising to hide their wealth far away from I.R.S. auditors.
946 2010-02-01 LONDON — British business executives dealing with China were given a formal warning more than a year ago by Britain’s security service, MI5, that Chinese intelligence agencies were engaged in a wide-ranging effort to hack into British companies’ computers and to blackmail British businesspeople over sexual relationships and other improprieties, according to people familiar with the MI5 document.

The warning, in a 14-page document titled “The Threat from Chinese Espionage,” was prepared in 2008 by MI5’s Center for the Protection of National Infrastructure, and distributed in what security officials described as a “restricted” form to hundreds of British banks and other financial institutions and businesses. The document followed public warnings from senior MI5 officials that China posed “one of the most significant espionage threats” to Britain.

Details of the document were confirmed Sunday by two people familiar with its contents, who both spoke on an anonymous basis because of the sensitivity of the subject. The document’s existence was first reported in the British newspaper The Sunday Times.

Last month, Google announced that it was considering ending its operations in China after a “sophisticated and targeted” cyberattack that it said aimed primarily to gain access to the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Google said it was no longer willing to cooperate with China in what amounted to censorship of its search engine, which Google had operated in a way that prevented millions of Chinese from reaching Web sites deemed hostile by Beijing.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called on China to investigate the cyberattacks, and said that companies like Google should refuse to support “politically motivated censorship.” Without acknowledging any government involvement in the attacks, China has responded by saying that Internet companies like Google are welcome to do business in China “according to the law.” A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that “Chinese law proscribes any form of hacking activity.”
947 2010-02-01 “You have this blind spot on insurance companies,” said Christopher Whalen, a co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics, a research firm.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners says insurers were the third-biggest issuers of credit-default swaps, after banks and hedge funds, with 18 percent of the market in 2007.

“We have a desperate need for federal regulation and federal disclosure by the insurance companies,” Mr. Whalen said. “But even after A.I.G., we still don’t have a proposal for federal regulation, or even enhanced disclosure, and that’s the dirty secret here.”

Credit-default swaps, in essence, work like bond insurance, in which the issuer promises to make a bondholder whole in case of problems like a default. But the swaps differ from conventional insurance in important ways. There are no required reserves, for instance. And any institution can buy the swaps — not just bondholders.

That has led critics to liken the use of swaps to buying insurance on a neighbor’s house, in hopes of a payday when he has a fire. A.I.G.’s London branch used these swaps in huge volume, causing a disaster when the purchasers all descended at once, demanding payments, and A.I.G. ran out of money.

The Delaware insurance unit with the credit-default swaps is one of A.I.G.’s biggest. Known as Alico, or the American Life Insurance Company, the unit does its conventional insurance business overseas in more than 40 countries. Its counterparties on the swaps, though, are big United States banking companies.

If the measure passed by the House became law, an insurer like Alico that used swaps to sell protection against bond defaults would be designated a “swap dealer,” and have to comply with capital requirements and other rules. That way, the company would be required to have money to stand behind its promises, said Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which supports the provision.

Insurance regulators said Delaware did not consider credit-default swaps to be insurance.

“I don’t think an insurance commissioner should tread on the toes of the banking industry,” said Karen Weldin Stewart, the commissioner in Delaware. “This started out as a bank product.”

Her special deputy for examinations, John Tinsley, explained the reasoning. “In insurance, you’re putting together a pool,” he said. Each customer would be charged a premium based on the total risk of the pool.

A credit-default swap cannot be insurance, Mr. Tinsley said, because it does not involve a pool. There is just one seller and one buyer for every contract.

“It’s an investment product,” he said. “It’s closer to buying an option.”

Not everyone agrees. Eric R. Dinallo, New York State’s insurance superintendent when A.I.G. imploded, said he believed credit-default swaps were insurance and should be regulated as such.

Even at its peak, in 2007, Alico’s portfolio of credit-default swaps was just a fraction of the one at A.I.G. Financial Products, the London shop whose collapsing business led the United States government to prop up A.I.G., the biggest bailout in American history.

If Alico’s entire portfolio had blown up that year, the maximum possible loss — a little more than $1 billion — would not have wiped out the company’s total reported surplus of $7 billion.

Alico’s executives said they considered their swap program much safer as well. Michael Buthe, the chief investment officer, said that the company had sold protection only on investment-grade bonds, which the company considered unlikely to default.

Alico’s chief financial officer, Christopher J. Swift, added that the bonds were issued by companies in many commercial sectors, which diversified the portfolio. That differed starkly from A.I.G. Financial Products, whose swaps gave A.I.G. a vast, undiversified exposure to the housing markets.

“This isn’t tied to real estate,” Mr. Swift said of his company’s program. “It diversified our holdings and increased yield.”

When the markets soured in 2008, the company realized a $52 million loss as it terminated many of the contracts. “We’re constantly monitoring the market, and we saw the economics changing,” Mr. Buthe said.

The program has been unwound, with only a few swaps remaining, and Mr. Buthe said the company was not planning to rebuild it.

972 2010-02-02 Devils defenseman Paul Martinwill not play for the UnitedStates in the Vancouver Olympicsbecause of a broken left forearmthat has been slow to heal.

A disappointed Martin announcedMonday that he waswithdrawing his name from theUnited States team.

Martin was injured Oct. 24 in agame at Pittsburgh when he washit by Bill Guerin’s shot. Martinhad a setback in his recovery inDecember when surgery had tobe done because the fracture didnot heal at the rate doctors wanted.

Martin skated on his own lastweek and was told by doctorsMonday that he would have towear his cast another two weeks.

“It is healing properly, it’s justnot to the point where the doctorwants to see it,” Lou Lamoriello,the Devils’ president and generalmanager, said in a telephone interview.

The United States will play itsfirst Olympic game againstSwitzerland on Feb. 16. A replacementfor Martin will probably bepicked by the end of this week,the USA Hockey spokesmanDave Fischer said.

RAHLVES SHOULD BE READY TheUnited States Olympic freestyleskiers Daron Rahlves and CaseyPuckett are recuperating at homeand should be ready for the VancouverGames, according to BillMarolt, the chief executive of theUnited States Ski and SnowboardAssociation.

Rahlves was released from ahospital Sunday after dislocatinghis hip in a nasty wreck duringhis opening ski cross race at theWinter X Games. Puckett, theAmericans’ other ski cross Olympian,had a minor setback lastweek in his recovery from a separatedshoulder after landing awkwardlyduring a run.
973 2010-02-02 In what could amount to an unusual gift from Israel’s Olympic committee, a 16-year-old Australian figure skater appears to be on her way to the Vancouver Games.

Tamar Katz was Israel’s first Olympic qualifier in women’s figure skating, but her country’s Olympic committee had a rule that stipulated that she finish in the top 14 at the European championships to earn a trip to the Games. She finished 21st.

Boris Chait, the president of Israel’s skating federation, said Monday that Israel had surrendered the qualifying spot less than two weeks before the start of the Games. That opened the door for the next skater in line in qualifying: 16-year-old Cheltzie Lee, a Sydney native.

Australia’s Olympic team said on its Web site that, “due to quota reallocation,” Lee had been selected for the Vancouver Games. The statement was removed from the site after a reporter inquired about it with Mike Tancred, a spokesman for the Australia Olympic Committee.

“Of course I’m upset after all the hard work and moving far away from my family to train,” Katz said in a telephone interview. “It would have been a great honor to represent my country at the Olympic Games.

"I wish the Australian skater the best of luck  it’s a wonderful opportunity for her.”

Katz said she appealed to the former Israeli ambassador Zalman Shoval and asked him to speak with Israel’s minister of culture and sport, Limor Livnat, to overturn the decision.

Katz’s agent, Jerry Solomon, said he appealed to the president of Israel’s Olympic Committee, Zvi Varshaviak. “This is an oddball situation,” Solomon said. “Tamar qualified and has a spot. Israel’s standards are higher than Olympic standards. I have never heard of anything like that.”
974 2010-02-02 As the Obama administration begins talking to Congress about a new jobs bill, it is still having trouble saying with precision how many jobs have been spurred so far by last year’s effort, the $787 billion stimulus package that was designed to create or save 3.5 million jobs over two years.

Over the weekend, in fact, the administration released the latest figures showing the impact of the stimulus package on jobs, announcing that nearly 600,000 jobs had been financed directly in the fourth quarter of 2009. But it changed the definition of those jobs, making it hard for Congress or the public to keep score and learn how the stimulus is doing.

From February to September, the administration had said, more than 640,000 jobs were saved or created. But in the final quarter of 2009, the administration no longer asked recipients whether all of those jobs were actually created or saved by the stimulus money or whether some of those jobs might have existed without the stimulus money.

Instead, it now simply counts all existing jobs paid for with stimulus money as saved jobs, whether or not they would have been lost without the money.

The new, more expansive definition will make it more difficult to isolate the effects of the stimulus law, which is officially called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but should make it easier for states and employers to calculate jobs. But the new definition also means that the new tally of 599,108 jobs reported in the fourth quarter cannot be compared with the earlier figures from 2009.
975 2010-02-02 The square was once a marketplace with stalls and storage areas, but in 2002 former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide ordered it razed to make way for a park, the people here said. It was not a popular decision. The market was quickly demolished; the park project languished for years.

Now, the square is village, plaza and marketplace in one. Not a donated tent is in sight, but Carmalite Henry, 51, was watching as two men built a small shack, about eight feet square, for her family of four. She paid them about $50, money borrowed from friends.

Gerome Julie, a mother of four, said she had built her own small hut, digging holes for the posts and spending about $60 on nails, wood and metal. Asked if it was watertight, she said: “I don’t know. It hasn’t rained yet.”

She was selling toilet paper, laundry detergent and soap from an inventory she had before the quake, making a quarter in profit on each item, she said.

Nearby, Gary Pierre and his shoeshine box were planted in their usual spot. “I never moved,” he said. “I come here every day, even the day of the earthquake.” But now, it is more often food, not money, that changes hands. “I clean your shoes, and then you give me some food,” he said. “I carry water for you, and then you call me: ‘The food is ready, bring your bowl.’ ”

Just then, Duvery Elivert, a college student, walked up, handed him a coin and propped a dusty black shoe on the box, just as he had always done on Sundays before church.

Even the lottery, or bolèt, is on its way back. On the square, there were at least three places to buy tickets starting for as little as a couple of pennies. At one lottery seller, Ronald Center Bank — the impressive name was written on a piece of scrap metal propped against the curb — business was slow. “There is no money,” said the proprietor, Ronald St. Hubert. “But people believe in the lottery.”

The square has seen little in the way of humanitarian relief, said Fednel Sainsulme, the secretary of the camp committee. Mr. Sainsulme said the committee, which included two policemen, patrolled at night, reported to the mayor and tried to negotiate for the orderly distribution of donated goods.

When a man from a nonprofit group called Hays PureWater for All appeared with a simple filter that converts salt water to a chlorine solution that can disinfect water, a committee member volunteered to distribute the chlorine by the capful. Other camps have selected committees.

Before the quake Mr. Sainsulme was a pastor, photographer and teacher; his working life was not so easy to resume. The nine-room school where he used to teach, like every other school in Léogâne, collapsed. “I am just waiting for God,” he said.
976 2010-02-02 Three weeks ago, Google blamed hackers that it connected to China for a series of sophisticated attacks that led to the theft of the company’s valuable source code. Google also said hackers had infiltrated the private Gmail accounts of human rights activists, suggesting the effort might have been more than just mischief.

In addition to independent criminals like Majia, computer security specialists say there are so-called patriotic hackers who focus their attacks on political targets. Then there are the intelligence-oriented hackers inside the People’s Liberation Army, as well as more shadowy groups that are believed to work with the state government.

Indeed, in China — as in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia — computer hacking has become something of a national sport, and a lucrative one. There are hacker conferences, hacker training academies and magazines with names like Hacker X Files and Hacker Defense, which offer tips on how to break into computers or build a Trojan horse, step by step.

For less than $6, one can even purchase the “Hacker’s Penetration Manual.” (Books on hacking are also sold, to a lesser extent, in the United States and elsewhere.)

And with 380 million Web users in China and a sizzling online gaming market, analysts say it is no wonder Chinese youths are so skilled at hacking. Many Chinese hackers interviewed over the last few weeks describe a loosely defined community of computer devotees working independently, but also selling services to corporations and even the military. Because it is difficult to trace hackers, exactly who is behind any specific attack and how and where they operate remains to a large extent a mystery, technology experts say.

And that is just the way Majia, the young Chinese hacker, wants it. On condition that he not be identified by his real name, Majia agreed two weeks ago to allow a reporter to visit his modest home in a poor town outside Changsha, and watch him work.

Slim and smartly dressed in black, Majia seemed eager to tell his story; like many hackers, he wants recognition for his hacking skills even as he prizes anonymity to avoid detection. The New York Times found him through another well-known hacker who belongs to a hacker group and vouched that Majia was skilled at what he did.

While Majia’s claims, of course, cannot be verified, he is happy to demonstrate his hacking skills. He met a journalist at a cafe one night just over a week ago, and then invited him to his home, where he showed how he hacked into the Web site of a Chinese company. Once the Web site popped up on his screen, he created additional pages and typed the word “hacked” onto one of them.

Majia says he fell in love with hacking in college, after friends showed him how to break into computer systems during his freshman year.

After earning a degree in engineering, he took a job with a government agency, largely to please his parents. But every night after work, he turns to his passion: hacking.

He is consumed by the challenges it presents. He reads hacker magazines, swaps information with a small circle of hackers and writes malicious code. He uses Trojan horses to sneak into people’s computers and infect them, so he can take control.

“Most hackers are lazy,” he says, seated in front of a computer in his spare bedroom, which overlooks a dilapidated apartment complex. “Only a few of us can actually write code. That’s the hard part.”

Computer hacking is illegal in China. Last year, Beijing revised and stiffened a law that makes hacking a crime, with punishments of up to seven years in prison. Majia seems to disregard the law, largely because it is not strictly enforced. But he does take care to cover his tracks.

Partly, he admits, the lure is money. Many hackers make a lot of money, he says, and he seems to be plotting his own path. Exactly how much he has earned, he won’t say. But he does admit to selling malicious code to others; and boasts of being able to tap into people’s bank accounts by remotely operating their computers.

Financial incentives motivate many young Chinese hackers like Majia, experts say. Scott J. Henderson, author of “The Dark Visitor: Inside the World of Chinese Hackers,” said he had spent years tracking Chinese hackers, sometimes with financial help from the United States government. One Chinese hacker who broke into a United States government site later lectured on hacking at a leading university, Mr. Henderson said, and worked for China’s security ministry. But recently, many have been seeking to profit from stealing data from big corporations, he said, or teaching others how to hijack computers.

“They make a lot of money selling viruses and Trojan horses to infect other people’s computers,” Mr. Henderson said in a telephone interview. “They also break into online gaming accounts, and sell the virtual characters. It’s big money.”

Majia lives with his parents, and his bedroom has little more than a desktop computer, a high-speed Internet connection and a large closet. The walls are bare.

Most of his socializing occurs online, where he works from about 6:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., starting every evening by perusing computer Web sites like cnBeta.com.

Asked why he doesn’t work for a major Chinese technology company, he sneers at the suggestion, saying that it would restrain his freedom.

He even claims to know details of the Google attack. “That Trojan horse on Google was created by a foreign hacker,” he says, indicating that the virus was then altered in China. “A few weeks before Google was hijacked, there was a similar virus. If you opened a particular page on Google, you were infected.”

Oddly, Majia said his parents did not know that he was hacking at night. But at one point, he explained the intricacies of computer hacking and stealing data while his mother stood nearby, listening silently, while offering a guest oranges and candy.

Majia and his fellow hackers keep secret their knowledge of certain so-called zero-day vulnerabilities — software flaws — for future use, he says.

“Microsoft and Adobe have a lot of zero days,” he said, while scanning Web sites at home. “But we don’t publish them. We want to save them so that some day we can use them.”

When asked whether hackers work for the government, or the military, he says “yes.”

Does he? No comment, he says.
977 2010-02-02 By now, many people who walk along West 11th Street and see the sign on the south portico of St. Vincent’s Hospital must wonder what it could possibly mean. “The Wall of Hope and Remembrance,” it reads.

Hope for what? Remembrance of what? No clue is offered. There is just a blank wall.

Something used to be there. It spoke of a city’s heartbreak. In a sense, it became a casualty of the financial troubles that have put St. Vincent’s future in doubt. A huge health-services network is looking to take charge of the hospital, recast its mission and, inevitably, alter its identity.

What used to be there was a tableau that stretched 25 feet or more. It contained hundreds of fliers that popped up across New York after the planes hit the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001. Missing, they said. The word was offered more in prayer than hope. You remember:

Have you seen Elizabeth Holmes? She was in 2 World Trade Center. How about Lindsay Herkness? He was on the 73rd floor. Maybe you know of Lucy Crifasi? She was wearing a striped blouse, black and olive green. Please, please, what about Thomas Edward Galvin or Harry Glenn or Joan Donna Griffith? “Still searching, never forgotten,” said the flier for David Marc Sullins, a paramedic killed while trying to rescue injured people.

Many of these appeals were posted outside St. Vincent’s. That made sense. The hospital was not far from the trade center. Hundreds went there for emergency treatment that day — a point that may well be put forth by those who fear that emergency care will end at St. Vincent’s if it is taken over.

Soon enough, hospital officials gathered the sheets of paper, placed them side by side, covered them with plexiglass and mounted them on the south portico wall. There they stood for four years, forming the Wall of Hope and Remembrance. But they began to deteriorate, especially after a winter storm ripped up the protective coating. The fliers were taken down, but with an intention to put them back eventually on display.

“People spoke very positively about doing something,” said Sister Kevin Phillips, a senior vice president at the hospital. “One of our doctors really got into it. He had a couple of architects who came in, and they made a very nice display. It was going to be quite elegant.”
978 2010-02-02 True, buyers of the debt being sold this week will be slotting into the top of the capital structure. And McClatchy’s equity value of more than $450 million should give them comfort that they are not on the front lines of bankruptcy. But their cash will be used to pay previous senior creditors — not cushion the balance sheet.

The newspaper business is making headway in cutting costs and increasing online revenue. But metropolitan print newspapers are still in decline. Bond holders may well make McClatchy pay up to reflect this not-so-long-term risk.

Regulators and bankers rarely see eye to eye. But at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, the two sides were in surprising agreement about creating a global fund to deal with future bailouts, financed by a tax on banks.

Mario Draghi, head of the Financial Stability Board, which is spearheading a new global financial regulatory regime under the auspices of the Group of 20 nations, floated the idea of a cross-border body to manage this fund. Several big European banks, including Barclays and Deutsche Bank, supported the idea.

Mr. Draghi’s plan has merits. The crisis has shown how ill-prepared regulators were to deal with the failure of large, cross-border financial institutions. It makes sense to set up a permanent body to coordinate among the different countries in which a bank operates.

There is also excellent logic for a bank levy — on the lines of President Obama’s proposed tax on American banks’ wholesale liabilities. Though most banks pay fees to insure their retail deposits, there is no such charge for the short-term wholesale financing that made some banks particularly vulnerable to a sudden loss of confidence.

A cross-border bailout fund, however, looks like a stretch. To begin with, it would take years to create a fund large enough to deal with banks that ran into trouble. In the meantime, governments would still be at risk for bailouts.

It is also hard to see governments giving up responsibility for bailing out their banks. After all, their support during the crisis often came in the form of direct equity injections. The politicians aren’t going to swallow a cross-border agency taking large ownership stakes in banks like Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

But the biggest objection to a global bank tax is likely to be fiscal. Strapped governments will never allow a meaningful amount of tax revenue to disappear into a global fund.

Bank reforms should be coordinated globally. But the best that can be hoped for on the fiscal front is a series of national taxes that all operate roughly according to the same principles. LAUREN SILVA LAUGHLIN and PETER THAL LARSEN
979 2010-02-02 Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations’ climate change office, said that the submissions showed that the commitment to confront climate change on the part of the world’s nations was “beyond doubt,” but he urged countries to do more.

“Greater ambition is required to meet the scale of the challenge,” he said.

Analysts said that even if all nations met their promises, the world would still be on a path to exceed the Copenhagen agreement’s central goal of limiting global warming to less than 3.6 degrees above the pre-industrial era.

“The pledges put on the table to date do not put us on track to meet that goal and will make it very difficult for us politically and technically beyond 2020 to meet that target,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Other aspects of the accord remain unresolved, including the question of financial aid for developing nations to adapt to climate changes and develop sustainable growth plans. The wealthy nations pledged nearly $30 billion in short-term support, but there is no mechanism in place to collect or distribute the money. Longer-term aid pledges remain just a concept.

Nonetheless, it was the first time that major developing nations, whose emissions are growing more quickly than the rest of the world’s, put on paper their plans for slowing production of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to a warming planet.

China said it would reduce its carbon intensity — the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic activity — by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels.

India said its carbon intensity would fall by 20 to 25 percent over the same period.

South Korea set an intensity target of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.

Raekwon Chung, the South Korean ambassador for climate change, said that his nation’s target was set into law in December and that the government was preparing plans to carry it out.

He said South Korea planned to invest 2 percent of its gross domestic product, about $86 billion a year, in green growth programs, including low-carbon energy production, new transportation systems and higher-efficiency building codes.

The major industrialized powers also repeated earlier pledges. The European Union said its 27 members would cut emissions by 20 to 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020. Japan’s target is 25 percent over the same period.

The United States, in a submission last Thursday, repeated President Obama’s promise to cut emissions “in the range of” 17 percent by 2020 compared with 2005 levels — but only if Congress enacts legislation that meets that goal, a far-from-certain prospect.

Jennifer Morgan, director of the World Resources Institute’s climate and energy program, urged Congress to act quickly on climate change legislation, or risk seeing the United States fall further behind in the competition to develop new low-carbon sources of energy.

“The pledges made by countries like Japan, China, Europe and India show a commitment to collective, transparent action on a scale never seen before,” she said in a statement. “The United States should have no doubt that these countries plan to build their economies with clean energy.”
980 2010-02-02 For Taylor Swift, the jig is up.

Over the last three and a half years, Ms. Swift has established herself as pop’s leading naïf. Not in her songwriting, which has been precocious, but in her persona. By now, she’s even patented a look she whips out at award shows, concerts and more, when her innocence is threatened by acclaim: eyes wide, mouth agape, hand held over it as if to keep in the breath she’d just gasped as if it were her last.

Most stars — and make no mistake, Ms. Swift is the most important new pop star of the past few years — have their images undone by failure. In Ms. Swift’s case, the opposite is true: success has necessitated a re-evaluation.

Her Sunday night at the Grammys will be remembered as the turning point. She won four awards, including album of the year for “Fearless” (Big Machine), her outstanding second record — the youngest artist ever to do so, and the first solo female country singer to earn that as well. It was the ultimate stamp of insider approval for someone who insists that she’s thrilled just to be invited to the party.

But the night also revealed her weaknesses. Her new single, “Today Was a Fairytale,” from the “Valentine’s Day” soundtrack, opened her performance, and it was limp, a parody of her best songs about teen love fantasy. That transitioned into a pitch-challenged duet of “Rhiannon” with Stevie Nicks, who then joined in — facing her own vocal challenges — on a banjolin-driven version of Ms. Swift’s “You Belong With Me.”

Ms. Swift is still young — she’s got teenage taste, some of it bad (Owl City, Boys Like Girls), some of it better (John Mayer) — and it’s refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub. Compare her with, say, Beyoncé, the night’s only bigger winner, who appears allergic to risk, or showing weakness.
981 2010-02-02 “I don’t see anything that looks that compelling,” said Linley Gwennap, a chip analyst at the Linley Group. “It doesn’t seem like something all that new, and, if it is, they are not getting far with it.”

As he unveiled the iPad last week, Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, discussed the A4 with his customary hyperbolic flair. He heralded it as “the most advanced chip” Apple had ever used and said it was crucial to the iPad’s speed, reliability and 10-hour battery life.

“We have an incredible group that does custom silicon at Apple,” Mr. Jobs said, adding that the A4 has “everything in this one chip, and it screams.” Apple declined to discuss details of the chip beyond what it had said publicly.

Apple bought its way into the chip business in 2008, acquiring the 150-employee start-up PA Semi. That company had been working on chips that could handle large volumes of data while consuming very low amounts of power.

PA Semi’s engineers, most of them veterans from other chip companies in Silicon Valley, had just the type of expertise that a company making music players, laptops and phones would want.

Over all, the A4-powered iPad’s battery life and speed seem similar to those of computers running on competing chips. A wave of tiny laptops known as smartbooks will arrive shortly after the iPad starts selling in March, running at the same speed as the iPad while offering up to 16 hours of battery life when playing video. These will run on chips by Nvidia and Qualcomm that have designs reminiscent of the A4.

Apple has a history of trying to ostentatiously best the competition. It promoted the MacBook Air, introduced in 2008, as the thinnest laptop ever. By building the A4 into the iPad, Apple appears to have bought a small lead over rivals — or at least kept pace with them — in this emerging class of mobile devices.

“From what we have seen so far, Apple’s product seems to stack up evenly with the competition,” said Dean McCarron, a chip analyst with Mercury Research. “Clearly, Apple is using their own metric for whatever ‘best’ is.” Apple’s laptops and desktops run on Intel chips, while Samsung has been selling Apple the primary chips for the iPhone. Analysts believe Samsung is actually manufacturing the A4 as well, using a common industry design for the core of the chip, while Apple has tweaked other parts of the processor package to suit its needs.

Apple’s other mobile devices like the iPhone and iPod Touch could conceivably all run on Apple-designed chips someday. Analysts point out that it often takes about two years for chip designers to create something from scratch, test it and have a finished product arrive from a factory.

Some of the chip engineers Apple gained in its purchase of PA Semi appear to have already left the company. According to partial records on the job networking site LinkedIn, at least half a dozen former PA Semi engineers have left Apple and turned up at a start-up called Agnilux, based in San Jose. The company was co-founded by one of PA’s leading system architects, Mark Hayter.

Neither Mr. Hayter nor other onetime PA workers who left Apple for Agnilux were willing to discuss either company’s plans. According to two people with knowledge of the two companies, who were unwilling to be named because the matter is delicate, some PA engineers left Apple a few months after the acquisition because they were given grants of Apple stock at an unattractive price.

Apple still appears committed to its chip plans. Even the analysts who dismiss the A4 as a “me too” product say Apple’s decision to give it a name and discuss it so publicly indicates that custom chips are a priority.

“This is somewhere where Apple thinks it can make a unique product, and it definitely signals a new direction for them,” said Nathan Brookwood, a chip analyst at Insight 64.
982 2010-02-02 Instrumental virtuosity is like any kind of power on earth, corruptive and constructive in equal measure. It’s a handicap, in a strange way: the musician must acquire one more level of refinement to turn it toward the good. If you can sing through your instrument — particularly if you can do it very, very speedily — you can make a music that seems lordly, pinched and gloating. Or you can spread a generous feeling through a room and somehow transcend your own gifts.

Jazz-rock fusion and progressive metal are still areas of unrepentant virtuosity in music, and young prog-metal musicians are still taking cues from aging fusion guitarists. Allan Holdsworth, possibly the most influential of those early 1970s-generation fusion heroes, played his annual gig at Iridium last week, with his quartet. And a prog-metal show at the Fillmore at Irving Plaza on Saturday, including the Florida band Cynic, confirmed the flow of information.

Over the past few years Mr. Holdsworth has been revisiting the music he played as a member of the drummer Tony Williams’s jazz-fusion band Lifetime in the mid-’70s. There are three other outwardly skillful players in the current band — the keyboardist Alan Pasqua, who was in the same edition of Lifetime; the bassist Jimmy Haslip; and the drummer Chad Wackerman, who tattooed all the music with loud tom-tom fills. But no matter how well they play — and Mr. Pasqua in particular was loose and intense in Thursday night’s early set — you tend to sit and wait for the guitar solos.

It’s rare in any music to see a player as neurally connected to his instrument as Mr. Holdsworth is. Stationary and nearly expressionless as he played Lifetime repertory like the meditative “Fred” and the whomping “Red Alert,” he began his improvisations in juddering wide-step phrases that quickly changed into connected runs, sometimes using hammer-on technique, without picking. At their fastest, his long lines are nearly glissandos, and with an eerie sense of civility he devoured the governing mode or tonality of the music. His phrasing was almost never predictable.

But the music as a whole was nearly welded to its genre. One of the great things about Mr. Holdsworth’s early work, and about Lifetime, with all its whirligig, macho soloing, was its strangeness. In the music’s volume and force you couldn’t easily straighten it out — the jazz influences, the rock influences, the motivation behind it all. (Maybe that’s why they called it “shredding”: it destroyed evidence of origins.) Thursday’s set, by comparison, felt classical, pedigreed.
983 2010-02-02 Re “Abusing Not Only Children, but Also Science” (Books, Jan. 26): All too often, psychologists and psychiatrists either play down the impact of childhood abuse or neglect to ask about it altogether.

A variety of factors account for this failure, including the American fetish for stoicism and the fear of causing friction. Likewise, when the perpetrator is a parent or family member, the lack of expressed shock on the part of the child does not in any way disprove that he or she has suffered trauma.

Numbness and detachment are part of the same fight-or-flight response that gets primed by abuse, and are especially prevalent when the abuser has otherwise gained the child’s trust. That’s why, as adults, people who were victimized as children are often slow to identify repeat abuse.
984 2010-02-02 PARIS  Nearly 10 years after a Concorde jet crashed on takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, Continental Airlines and five people went on trial on Tuesday in a French criminal court, accused of manslaughter in the deaths of 113 people.

A 2002 report by French air accident investigators concluded that a small strip of metal had fallen off a Continental DC-10 that took off minutes earlier, and that the piece punctured a tire of the Air France Concorde as it accelerated down the runway on the afternoon of July 25, 2000. The damaged tire disintegrated in seconds, investigators said, sending shards of rubber into the fuel tanks and causing a catastrophic fire. All 109 passengers and crew were killed, along with 4 people on the ground.

Continental has always strenuously denied responsibility for the crash, and the airline’s lawyer, Olivier Metzner, plans to present testimony from more than 20 witnesses that he said would prove that the supersonic jet caught fire several seconds before it reached the titanium metal strip.

The trial is likely to continue until the end of May, with a verdict expected in the fall. Continental faces a fine of nearly $500,000, and its employees  an American mechanic and his supervisor  could receive suspended sentences of up to three years in prison if convicted, Mr. Metzner said.

Prosecutors will also seek to implicate two employees of Aérospatiale, the French manufacturer that took part in creating the Concorde, as well as an official of France’s civil aviation authority responsible for regulating the jet’s safety. A French judicial inquiry determined that the Concorde’s makers had been aware since 1979 of a design flaw that left the plane’s fuel tanks vulnerable to external shocks.

The decision to bring criminal charges in the Concorde case has raised hackles among airlines and aviation safety experts worldwide, who contend that the threat of prosecution can dissuade some witnesses from cooperating in crash investigations. France is one of a handful of countries that routinely seek criminal indictments in transportation accidents, regardless of whether there is clear evidence of criminal intent or negligence.

Such cases do not always result in convictions. In 2006, a French court acquitted five former aviation officials and a former Airbus executive of all charges linked to the 1992 crash of a passenger jet in the mountains near the German border, which killed 87 people.

Air France itself is not accused of wrongdoing and has joined the case as a civil party in the hope of recouping financial damages from Continental. The airline reached a $150 million civil settlement in 2001 with the families of the victims, most of them German citizens.

The crash of Air France Flight 4590 was the only fatal accident involving the Concorde, which first took to the skies in 1969. The disaster hastened the end of commercial operations of the plane, which had become a financial burden for its two operators, Air France and British Airways. Both airlines took the plane out of service in 2003.

Only 20 of the planes were ever built, and just 14 entered commercial service with Air France and British Airways, catering to affluent trans-Atlantic travelers ranging from investment bankers to rock stars. With a maximum cruising speed of 1,350 miles per hour, the Concorde was capable of flying from London to New York in less than three and a half hours.
985 2010-02-02 Dwight Freeney, the Indianapolis Colts’ Pro Bowl defensive end, has a torn ligament in his right ankle, Adam Schefter of ESPN reported Sunday, an injury that will make it difficult for him to play against the New Orleans Saints in the Super Bowl on Sunday. The most recent word from the Colts, however, was that Freeney had only a low ankle sprain and was still listed as questionable for the game.

So, whether Freeney will play on Sunday becomes the first big issue of Super Bowl week. As Peter King writes for Sports Illustrated, “We’ve got ourselves a story.” King goes on to say that “unless the ankle is simply collapsing, I can’t imagine him not playing.”

Mike Chappell of The Indianapolis Star, however, writes that the injury may do just that. While Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne said, “Dwight told me he’ll be ready,” Chappell writes: “That remains to be seen. A third-degree sprain is the worst, and usually involves a torn or ruptured ligament.”

Chappell’s article basically corroborates the ESPN report of torn ligaments — the Colts have called the injury “a third-degree, low basketball sprain” — although torn ligaments somehow sounds worse. Yahoo’s Shutdown Corner blog simply calls Freeney’s ankle the “world’s most famous body part.”

The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday night that Freeney was doing everything possible to play next weekend, including “spending hours a day in a hyperbaric chamber and using an electrical-stimulation machine on his ankle, even while he’s sleeping.”

Even if he should play, however, there are questions about how effective he would be. As Michael Marot writes for The Associated Press: “Freeney relies on incredible speed, remarkable spins and leverage to attack opponents. An ankle injury, however, could impact how he pushes off the foot, either slowing him down or preventing him from making the spins, to pressure Saints quarterback Drew Brees.”
986 2010-02-02 BEIJING — Chinese officials have rejected demands by the Dalai Lama that Tibetan areas of China receive greater autonomy and be governed as a single region, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported Monday.

The report came after days of meetings in China between Chinese officials and two envoys of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, who lives in exile in India. During the talks, a senior Chinese official, Du Qinglin, told the envoys that the concept of a “Greater Tibet” and “high-level autonomy” violated the Chinese Constitution, Xinhua reported. Mr. Du insisted that talks would progress “only if the Dalai Lama completely abandoned such claims,” according to the report.

The Tibetan envoys could not be reached for comment. They returned to India early Monday, according to Chhime R. Chhoekyapa, the Dalai Lama’s secretary, The Associated Press reported.

The meetings represented the ninth round in a series of negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama, a recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize, that began in 2002. Mr. Du is head of the United Front Work Department, the arm of the Chinese Communist Party that officially manages ethnic policy.

The position taken by Mr. Du appeared to close the door for now on any compromise by the Chinese involving the Dalai Lama’s most urgent demands. The Dalai Lama has said that he does not seek independence for Tibet but rather wants genuine autonomy for Tibetan areas, under which the Tibetans make their own policies regarding religious practice, education and immigration to the areas.
987 2010-02-02 DETROIT  Toyota, struggling to eliminate questions surrounding millions of its vehicles, announced a repair on Monday to stop gas pedals from possibly sticking and causing cars to speed up unexpectedly.

The solution involves installing a steel reinforcement bar in the pedal assemblies of 2.3 million vehicles in the United States. Toyota has said it will provide replacement pedals to more than five million buyers whose cars were recalled over floor mats that could jam the accelerator.

“These two fixes solve the issues that we know of,” said James E. Lentz III, president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.

The company said last fall that floor mats were the lone cause of the problem — but added in January that pedal assemblies could cause accelerators to stick.

Now, it is trying to assure owners and car shoppers that the matter is settled and to restore its credibility, which has been shaken more than in past recalls.

“If they’ve got it, great,” said Edwin M. Baum, head of the product and consumer litigation practice at Proskauer Rose in Manhattan. “If they haven’t got it, they have even bigger problems. Nobody knows right now.”

Even as Toyota announced the repair, it appeared somewhat at odds with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with which it tangled last fall for mischaracterizing the agency’s response to the floor mat problem. Toyota said the repair would be adequate for the life of the vehicle. But in a statement, the agency said owners who received that repair also might receive replacement pedals later on.

The questions for Toyota are not likely to end. Two Congressional committee hearings are planned, beginning next week.

A spokeswoman for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Toyota’s North American chief executive, Yoshimi Inaba, would attend its hearing on Feb. 10, along with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. That committee’s chairman, Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, has raised a series of questions about the recalls, while lawyers, safety advocates and some consumers have expressed their own doubts.

Specifically, many wonder whether the problem is in the electronic systems that now control many functions that used to be handled mechanically.

The shift to more computerized controls has made many vehicles, not just Toyotas, more difficult to fix in recent years. However, Mr. Lentz rebutted the notion that electronics were at fault, saying the systems had been “thoroughly tested.” He added, “It is not an electronics issue.”

Toyota told customers Monday that parts were on the way to dealers, whose staffs were being trained. The repair takes about 30 minutes, and Toyota said it would fix cars involved in the floor-mat recall at the same time.

The company said owners would have priority over vehicles on showroom lots, although dealers may begin repairing those, too. The company asked consumers to wait until they received letters from Toyota before contacting dealers for appointments.

Toyota suspended North American production this week on eight models involved in the sticking-pedal recall. It also stopped selling those cars, but said sales could gradually resume as vehicles were repaired.

Production is scheduled to resume next week, Toyota said.

The recalled models have pedals and sensors made by the CTS Corporation, a supplier in Elkhart, Ind., that differed slightly from parts made for Toyota by Denso, a Japanese supplier. None of the vehicles with the Denso version were recalled.

Some of the models in this month’s recall also were part of the November recall over floor mats. Among the vehicles covered in that recall, but not included in this month’s recall, are the 2004 to 2009 Prius hybrid and several Lexus models.

In several media appearances Monday, Mr. Lentz repeatedly apologized for the missteps.

“This is embarrassing for us, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that we have lost our edge on quality,” Mr. Lentz said. “Our reputation is based on safety.”

Toyota is involved in the biggest recall-related crisis in the industry since exploding Firestone tires on the Ford Explorer and other vehicles a decade ago.

But Mr. Lentz said the effect on sales could be “minimal” if Toyota handled its relationship with customers properly.

“The heat’s on now to make sure we do this right,” he added.

Kurt Schiele, the general manager of Elmhurst Toyota-Scion near Chicago, said his dealership had sold about 1,000 of the vehicles being recalled, and his staff planned to call each buyer to explain the repair and set up an appointment. Many already have called with questions.

“There’s a lot of fear that was struck into their hearts, but once they understood what’s going on, they felt a lot more comfortable,” Mr. Schiele said.

Analysts for Kelley Blue Book, which tracks prices for used cars, expect the average resale value of recalled Toyotas at auction houses and dealerships to drop 1 to 2 percent this week from levels before the recall.

The Toyota executive in charge of quality control, Shinichi Sasaki, told reporters in Nagoya on Tuesday that Toyota expected to see sales slow as a result of the recall and suspension of sales.

Recalls by Toyota in the past have triggered about a 20 percent fall in monthly sales before a gradual recovery he said. But the scale of the recent recall “was a cause for worry,” Mr. Sasaki said. “But our main concern is not about sales at all. It’s about regaining our customers’ trust,” he said.

The effect of the recalls on sales will be clear Tuesday, when automakers report monthly sales data. And shares of Toyota rose almost 5 percent on Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Toyota has rebounded from crises before in the United States, where it first started selling cars in 1957.

Its original offering, the Toyopet, proved to be too underpowered for American highways, forcing the company to shut its operations and return two years later with a more powerful car.

“People forget about a lot of things,” said James P. Womack, an author who has written extensively about Toyota. “Betting against Toyota has been a good way to lose money.”
988 2010-02-02 American officials, while supporting the Afghan government’s reconciliation efforts, have ruled out talking to hard-liners like Mullah Omar, whom they see as too close to Al Qaeda.

Mr. Stanekzai declined to say specifically with whom the government was negotiating. “It’s too early to say; it will ignite a lot of confusion,” he said. “We need a space for confidence building.”

The government is still working out the details of specific proposals to ensure security and jobs for Taliban members who change sides. Once those plans have been revealed, he said, “Then we can talk about this in more detail.”

In addition, Mr. Stanekzai said, many of the Taliban leaders were fearful of retaliation from other Taliban members. “We have to respect their safety as well,” he said.

At the London conference last Thursday, which brought together 50 allied and donor countries, reconciliation with and reintegration of insurgents was one of the leading topics. Mr. Karzai publicly invited the Taliban to join talks with the government, and said they would be included at a nationwide tribal assembly he has scheduled in six weeks.

Officials make a distinction between “reconciliation,” or talking to the Taliban leadership, and “reintegration,” which involves persuading lower-level followers to change sides. Both efforts, however, include providing positions and jobs to insurgents who change sides. The American military has been much more actively involved in reintegration efforts.

Last month, Kai Eide, the United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, met with a group of Taliban representatives, according to American and United Nations officials. Taliban leadership denied the reports.

“The leadership council once again emphasizes the continuation of the Islamic jihad against all invaders,” the Taliban said in a statement.

“If they deny the peace process, they are against the nation of Afghanistan,” Mr. Stanekzai said. “In Afghanistan, nobody is against the peace process. How could they stand against the peace process?”

There have been no formal peace negotiations since the war began in 2001. Publicly, the Taliban refuse to talk to the government until all foreign forces leave, while the government insists that the Taliban accept the Afghan Constitution.

At Monday’s news conference, also attended by the foreign and defense ministers as well as other officials, Mr. Stanekzai said, “We are working to find a way out of this that is not just military.”

As a part of that, he said, the government is “willing to incorporate various groups into Afghanistan’s government.” Also on Monday, Haider Reza, the director of the Mine Action Coordination Center of Afghanistan, which is financed by the United Nations, announced that the Afghan government would not be able to meet its mine-clearing goals because donor countries had not released all the money set aside for the work.

The country has received only $163 million of the $242 million pledged for the program year that begins March 21, Mr. Reza said.

Afghanistan and the international community pledged in 2006 to clear 70 percent of all mines by 2011 and 100 percent by 2013. “I can already now say Afghanistan will be forced to ask for an extension,” he said.

Mr. Reza attributed the shortfall to budgetary problems in donor countries stemming from the economic crisis. He said security problems in some parts of Afghanistan were also a problem.

In southern Afghanistan, three suicide bombers attempted to enter the Kabul Bank building in Qalat, the capital of Zabul Province, where police officers were lined up to receive their monthly pay. Police officers fired on them and two of the attackers detonated their explosives while the third escaped, according to Muhammad Jan Rasolyar, a spokesman for the provincial government.

The international forces reported that three soldiers were killed Monday, two in southern Afghanistan during a firefight and another from a roadside bomb in western Afghanistan. The soldiers’ nationalities were not identified.

A United States soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan on Monday, according to a news release from the American-led NATO coalition. Thirty American soldiers died last month, according to the Web site of icasualties.org, an independent organization that tracks military casualties, double the 15 who died the previous January. Fifteen other allied soldiers also died last month.

Seven Taliban insurgents were reported killed in Helmand Province after a NATO airstrike on a safe house in Musa Qala District during an operation with the Afghan Army, said Gen. Sher Mohammed Zazai, the Afghan National Army commander in the neighboring province of Kandahar.

1010 2010-02-03 In keeping with the golden statue theme, "Ajami," an Israeli film, one of five Oscar nominees for best foreign-language film, opens today in New York. The movie, takes its name from a rough neighborhood in Jaffa, a mostly Arab city just south of Tel Aviv. "This particular urban conflict zone may be unfamiliar to most American viewers, but it bears a definite kinship to mean streets we know very well, at least from movies and television," writes A.O. Scott. "We could almost be in the Los Angeles of 'Colors' or 'Boyz N the Hood,' the Baltimore of 'The Wire' or the Rio de Janeiro of 'City of God.' " The movie, written and directed by Scandar Copti, an Israeli Arab, and Yaron Shani, who is Jewish, "is acutely insightful about the social divisions within Israel, but it examines them without scolding or sentimentality. There is no finger-pointing here, and no group hugging either. Instead there is an acute sense of just how deep and wide the schisms are, not just between Jews and Arabs, but also between Christians and Muslims, rich and poor, farmers and city dwellers, men and women, young and old and so on."
1011 2010-02-03 In 1995, when oil prices were very low, Congress tried to encourage deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico by giving oil companies relief from some of the royalties they incur for producing oil and gas on public land.

It has never been clear how much new exploration this provision inspired, since steadily rising prices provided plenty of incentive. What is clear is that it has been a good deal for the industry and a bad deal for taxpayers. According to the Government Accountability Office, the provision could allow industry to escape up to $54 billion in legitimate royalties, depending on the price of oil.

Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts hopes to put things right with a bill that would clarify the law and prevent companies from signing new leases in the gulf until they renegotiate the old ones and pay royalties that are due. A similar bill has been approved three times in the House but has gone nowhere in the Senate.

Mr. Markey is particularly incensed this year because the oil companies are still doing very well despite lower demand, while the number of households needing federal help with their heating bills may rise to 10 million — a big increase. To help out, he has introduced a bill increasing the money to help needy people with their energy bills by one-third to $7.6 billion annually.

The royalty mess resulted from a familiar Washington story line: lazy bureaucrats and legislation riddled with ambiguities. But the reality is that many of these leases are now beginning to yield oil, which will remain free of royalties as long as Congress fails to provide the kind of remedy proposed by Mr. Markey.

Actually, Congress owes this not only to the taxpayers but to itself. Its original intention in 1995 was to provide incentives during periods of low prices — not a corporate gravy train when prices are robust.
1012 2010-02-03 Federal prosecutors unsealed criminal charges on Tuesday against an informant who had secretly recorded conversations with people charged in the insider trading case involving the Galleon Group hedge fund.

The move demonstrates how prosecutors and officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission are using people charged in previous cases to uncover other insider trading operations on Wall Street, including at Galleon.

The informant, David R. Slaine, worked as a top trader at Morgan Stanley during the technology boom of the late 1990s before joining Galleon. After Mr. Slaine left Galleon to set up his own firm, DSJ International Resources, he began receiving tips about research reports from Mitchel S. Guttenberg, a former executive at UBS Securities, before they were disseminated to the public, according to his guilty plea entered in December and revealed by prosecutors on Tuesday.

In mid-2007, authorities learned that Mr. Slaine had information about other people involved in insider trading who were not part of the UBS investigation. He then began assisting officials in an investigation of Galleon and another trading ring involving Craig C. Drimal, who worked out of Galleon’s offices, people close to the case said. Part of Mr. Slaine’s cooperation included wearing a hidden recording device in meetings with Mr. Drimal and others who have been charged in the Galleon case.

According to records unsealed on Tuesday, Mr. Slaine admitted that he and Erik R. Franklin, another associate at DSJ, traded on the tips, making more than $3 million in profits for the hedge fund, and $500,000 for himself. During the investigation into the tips in July 2007, Mr. Slaine agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators in the hope of receiving a reduced sentence.
1013 2010-02-03 Earlier in the day, Steve Stricker, the No. 3-ranked player in the world, was asked about McCarron using “cheating” to describe Mickelson, and he minced no words.

“Yeah, I didn’t care for his words, with using those two words so closely together, cheating and Phil Mickelson,” Stricker said. “We have enough going on in our sport right now where we don’t need any more attention to something like this.”

Indications are strong that the PGA Tour will work out a way to close the loophole that exists to the ban on square grooves that was enacted by the U.S.G.A. on Jan. 1. The loophole has its roots in language written into the tour’s portion of a lawsuit settlement with Ping in 1993.

The settlement says that the tour would abide by the wording of the settlement Ping made with the U.S.G.A. a year earlier in exempting the Ping club from any future banning of square-grooved wedges, whose grooves impart more spin to a golf ball hit from long or wet grass.

John Solheim, the chief executive of Ping, has indicated he is open to discussion. In a statement released Monday, he said, “While I fully expect the PGA Tour to honor this agreement, I’m willing to discuss a workable solution to this matter that would benefit the game and respect the role innovation has played over the long history of golf.”

McCarron’s apology was not surprising because of the stigma the word cheating carries in golf, a world in which adherence to the rules has always been a fundamental precept. Public accusations of breaches are rare and guarded, and are usually followed by an apology by the accuser.

There have been three public kerfuffles over rules violations in recent years. In one particularly nasty exchange at the 2009 British Open, Sandy Lyle — upset that he had been passed over as the 2010 European Ryder Cup captain — dredged up an accusation about a questionable drop four years earlier made by his fellow Scotsman Colin Montgomerie, the current Ryder Cup captain.

Lyle said Montgomerie’s drop at the 2005 Indonesian Open was “a form of cheating” and did not say Montgomerie was a cheat. After first claiming his words were taken out of context, Lyle apologized to Montgomerie two days later.

In one of the more well-known accusations made on the PGA Tour, Tom Watson accused Gary Player of removing a rooted leaf from behind his golf ball to improve his lie during the first televised Skins Game in 1983. Watson was livid, but he never used the words cheat or cheating.

In effect, what Mickelson and seven other players did by using the wedges in question last week was no different from what goes on almost every day of every tournament on the tour. Players are encouraged to know the rules so they can use them to their advantage. Many do not know all the rules and instead summon tour rules officials to make certain, but they do squeeze every possible benefit from the rulings.

In 1999, Woods recruited a group of beefy members of his gallery to help him move a boulder — which in the rules is the same as a small rock, a movable obstruction — from in front of his ball. The U.S.G.A. celebrates this incident on its Web site as “the most famous incident in Rules of Golf history.”

The Great Groove Loophole is not likely to be moved into any such exalted position on that site. More likely, it will be remembered as a preventable breach, briefly incendiary, with a short shelf life.
1014 2010-02-03 A senior Hamas leader said Tuesday that indirect talks with Israel on a prisoner exchange had collapsed and blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for hardening Israeli terms. In negotiations for the release of a captive Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, in exchange for about 1,000 jailed Palestinians, Israel was demanding that dozens of Palestinians who had been convicted of involvement in lethal attacks be deported upon their release, Mahmoud al-Zahar, left, told BBC World News. Mr. Netanyahu, asked about Mr. Zahar’s remarks, said: “If Hamas wants a deal, it will happen. If it doesn’t want a deal, it won’t happen.”
1015 2010-02-03 A Polish court issued a European arrest warrant on Tuesday for a former neo-Nazi leader suspected in the theft of the infamous “Arbeit Macht Frei” sign at Auschwitz. Rafal Lisak, spokesman for Krakow’s district court, said that Anders Hogstrom, 34, of Sweden, was suspected of incitement to commit theft of a cultural treasure. The sign, whose words are German for “Work Sets You Free,” was stolen in December from Auschwitz in southern Poland. The sign was found three days later, and five Polish men were charged with its theft.
1016 2010-02-03 The judge in the case acknowledged, “We’re dealing with a frontier here.”

The issue is part of a larger debate over fairness in sentencing sex offenders. For years, lawmakers (and some voters) have reasoned that virtually no punishment was too severe for such criminals; even statutory limits on sentencing were often exceeded.

Now some courts have begun to push back, saying these heavy sentences are improper, and a new emphasis has arisen on making sex offenders pay monetary damages for their crimes. If such damages become widespread, experts say, it may make it easier to reach a consensus on measured sentencing.

Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and an expert on sentencing, said the rise in monetary damages might curb “a troublesome modern tendency of many legislators and judges to respond to all perceived crime problems with longer and longer terms of imprisonment.”

Those longer terms and conditions are already under fire.

On Thursday, the California Supreme Court ruled 5 to 2 that a state ballot initiative allowing the indefinite extension of sentences for sexually violent predators might violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection; the court ordered a new hearing to explore the issues.

On Monday, the court also asked for more study on a law that prohibits sexual predators from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park after their release from prison. The law, called Jessica’s law, was approved by voters in 2006.

Corey Rayburn Yung, an expert in sex crimes at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said that while “it’s hard to be too sympathetic” toward those who possess images of child pornography, “there is such a thing as going too far.” The harm to child pornography victims from those who possess the images, he said, is less direct than that caused by those who abused the children.

The most novel approach is being taken by Amy’s lawyer, James R. Marsh, whose practice focuses on child exploitation cases. Mr. Marsh’s arguments are the fruits of a national movement granting greater rights to crime victims and shifting the financial burden of crimes to criminals, said Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and professor of law at the University of Utah, who advised Mr. Marsh and wrote a brief supporting his position in a Texas case.

Amy’s uncle is now in prison, but she is regularly reminded of his abuse whenever the government notifies her that her photos have turned up in yet another prosecution. More than 800 of the notices, mandated by the Crime Victims Rights Act and sent out by the federal victim notification system, have arrived at Amy’s home since 2005.

Those notices disturb Amy when they arrive, but Mr. Marsh, looking at the same pieces of paper, saw an opportunity: he could intervene in the federal prosecutions and demand restitution. He had Amy write a victim-impact statement and hired a psychologist to evaluate her. Economists developed a tally of damages that included counseling, diminished wages and lawyer fees. The total came to $3,367,854.

Mr. Marsh contends that every defendant should be ordered to pay the full amount, under the doctrine of joint and several liability. According to that doctrine, the recipient would stop collecting money once the full damages are paid, and those held responsible for the amount could then sue others who are found culpable for contributions. But the doctrine, which developed in civil law, does not apply as easily in criminal law, especially with an indeterminate population of defendants.

Amy’s first restitution award came in February in the Connecticut case; it involved Alan Hesketh, a British executive at the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, who paid $130,000. Since then, Mr. Marsh has automated the process and e-mailed Amy’s filings to United States Attorneys in 350 cases. “I’m able to leverage the power of the Internet to get restitution for a victim of the Internet,” he said.

Mr. Marsh has, in effect, expanded his small New York law firm by hundreds of federal prosecutors. Some of them decline to file for restitution — a judge in Minnesota ordered prosecutors to explain why — but many have. Judges’ reactions have varied, with some declining to order restitution, including one in Texas and another in Maine, usually saying that the link between possession and the harm done is too tenuous to reach the level of “proximate harm” generally required under the law for restitution.

Yet in two Florida cases, judges have ordered defendants to pay nearly the full amount requested and even more. Many judges who have considered the issues award a few thousand dollars. Even though many of the defendants have no way to pay even the smallest fine, Mr. Marsh’s efforts in the first year have earned $170,000 for Amy.

“This is a lawyer’s dream,” he said.

The federal government has struggled with how to best approach the wave of new cases, and those to come. Another victim known as Vicky has begun making similar claims in court, and still more victims could come forward. Professor Berman suggested Congress would have to sort out the issue, perhaps with a victim compensation fund.

A memorandum last summer from a lawyer in the Administrative Office of the Courts, the federal agency that runs the judicial branch, stated that the law did not support restitution for “mere possession.” But Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division at the Justice Department, issued a letter in October stating “we do not agree that restitution is not available to victims of the possession of child pornography as a matter of law.”

Mr. Breuer urged judges not to let “practical and administrative challenges” to the restitution issue “drive a policy position that directly or indirectly suggests that possession of child pornography is a victimless crime.”
1017 2010-02-03 Making the most of their season, tiny cupids decorate the red wrappers on Good Karmal’s buttery caramels, which sit in a beribboned basket for Valentine’s Day. The wrappers bear quotations from authors including Henry Miller, Aesop and Maya Angelou, and even a Zen proverb, “Leap and the net will appear.”

Vanilla, sea salt and chocolate sea salt flavors are mixed in the regular assortment. Another assortment adds black raspberry and green apple, and a third has espresso and chipotle flavors. The caramels are fresh, and are not sold in stores.

Good Karmal Valentine’s Day assortments are $45 for 30 pieces, $75 for 60 and $105 for 90. A portion of the proceeds goes to environmental charities; goodkarmal.com.
1018 2010-02-03 Nestlé barks when Mike Marder and his wife come home, and he barks when they leave. He barks at delivery boys, he barks at the doorbell, and he barks at the Marders’ new puppy, Truffle.

But for all that effort, the only sound Nestlé makes is a raspy squeak.

Dr. Marder, a veterinarian, tells those who are curious that Nestlé, a dachshund-terrier mix, is hoarse from too much barking.

But that is not true. The Marders had Nestlé’s vocal cords cut by a veterinary surgeon after a neighbor in the family’s apartment building on the Upper East Side threatened to complain to the co-op board about the noisy dog.

Although there is no reliable estimate as to how many dogs have had their vocal cords cut, veterinarians and other animal experts say that dogs with no bark can readily be found  but not necessarily heard  in private homes, on the show-dog circuit, and even on the turf of drug dealers, who are said to prefer their attack dogs silent.

The surgery usually leaves the animal with something between a wheeze and a squeak. The procedure, commonly referred to as debarking, has been around for decades, but has fallen out of favor, especially among younger veterinarians and animal-rights advocates.

Keeping pets in New York City, of course, has always required delicate negotiations between neighbors and species. The city’s 311 line fielded 6,622 complaints about barking dogs last year, while housing officials banned pit bulls, Rottweilers and other large dogs from public housing projects. Real estate experts say that co-op boards large and small always wrestle with pet policies, many of them tied to barking dogs.

Critics of the debarking procedure say it is outdated and inhumane, one that destroys an animal’s central means of communication merely for the owner’s convenience. Many veterinarians refuse to do the surgery on ethical grounds. Those who do rarely advertise it.

New Jersey bans devocalization surgery except for medical or therapeutic reasons, as do Britain and other European countries. Similar legislation is pending in Massachusetts, while Ohio restricts the surgery to nonviolent dogs.

But there are still those who perform the operation, and they and other advocates defend the surgery as a useful option for dog owners facing noise complaints and possible eviction.

Dr. Sharon L. Vanderlip has been performing debarking surgeries for more than 30 years as a small part of her veterinary practice in San Diego County. She calls herself a “big, big, big proponent” of the procedure if it is done the right way, for the right reasons.

“They recover immediately and they don’t ever seem to notice any difference,” she said. “I think that in certain cases it can certainly save a dog from ending up being euthanized. If properly done, they behave totally the same afterwards and don’t seem to have any health problems.”

The surgery can be relatively simple. The doctor anesthetizes the dog before cutting its vocal cords, either through the mouth or through an incision in the larynx. Dogs generally recover quickly, veterinarians say, and while they usually can still make sounds, their barks become muffled and raspy.

Dr. Gary W. Ellison, of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida, cautioned that the procedure can lead to complications. He said he has had to operate on debarked dogs after excess scar tissue built up in the throat, making it difficult for the dog to breathe.

“I think it’s probably going to be a procedure that’s done by fewer and fewer veterinarians” in the coming years, said Dr. Ellison, the curriculum director at the University of Florida’s veterinary school. He said professors there do not teach the surgery, and that he has not come across recent veterinary school graduates who have studied the procedure.

Banfield, the Pet Hospital, which has more than 750 veterinary practices across the country, formally banned the surgery last summer, though Jeffrey S. Klausner, the hospital’s senior vice president and chief medical officer, said it was rarely, if ever, practiced before that.
1019 2010-02-03 Dow Chemical posted a higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, but said demand in the United States and Europe remained weak.

While results were strong in countries like China and India, the chemical maker’s prices and sales fell in North America and Europe, indicating that those regions might not have fully recovered from the recession.

“We see demand in emerging geographies continuing to show sustained growth, which bodes well for global growth,” Andrew N. Liveris, Dow’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Growth will continue to lag in the U.S. and Europe, however.”

Sales rose in four of Dow’s seven business units, including basic plastics, where they rose 17 percent.

Dow put its Styron unit up for sale last July and said at the time the unit could fetch $1 billion to $2 billion. Mr. Liveris said the sale process had been “robust” and that Dow could “have something to report in the next month or so.”

The company reported net income of $178 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.55 billion, or $1.68 a share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 18 cents a share. By that measure, analysts had expected 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.
1020 2010-02-03 Emboldened by China’s newfound economic prowess but insecure about its standing at home, the Chinese Communist Party has been tightening Internet censorship, cracking down on legal rights defenders and brushing aside foreign leaders who seek to influence the outcome of individual cases.

In December, the authorities executed Akmal Shaikh, a British citizen, on drug trafficking charges despite Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s personal plea to President Hu Jintao that Mr. Shaikh was mentally ill.

During President Obama’s state visit to China in November, the plight of a pro-democracy advocate, Liu Xiaobo, was reportedly at the top of his list of concerns. A few weeks later, on Dec. 25, Mr. Liu was given an unexpectedly harsh 11-year sentence for publishing an online petition that sought expanded liberties.

John Kamm, a veteran American human rights campaigner, said that during three decades working in China he had rarely seen such a hard line toward dissidents — and unbridled defiance against pressure from abroad. “China right now doesn’t feel like it owes anyone anything on human rights,” said Mr. Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, which seeks clemency for political prisoners through quiet diplomacy. “I’ve never seen a downward spiral like this.”

In the 31 years since the People’s Republic of China and the United States established diplomatic relations, Chinese officials have often resisted American intervention on human rights, calling the issue a domestic matter. But there has generally been some give and take, largely behind the scenes, especially in the years after the violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square, when China was eager to shed its pariah status abroad.

That leverage began dissipating in 2001 after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization, and Congress surrendered the right to review China’s human rights record before granting it favorable trade status.

There is little space in Chinese society for unyielding dissidents like Mr. Gao. But until recently, the authorities often allowed them to stay at home under close surveillance. If they crossed certain unwritten lines, they might be prosecuted, often for the crime of inciting subversion or leaking state secrets. Even if stymied in their defense, lawyers can expect a modicum of information about their clients. Family jailhouse visits are not uncommon.

But Mr. Gao’s case has defied these norms.

In September, a security agent who took Mr. Gao into custody told one of his brothers that he had simply disappeared during a walk. The brother, Gao Zhiyi, said he suspected the worst. “If he were alive, they would have allowed me to visit him,” he said in a telephone interview from his home in Shaanxi Province. “Either that or he’s in such bad shape, it would be too horrible for anyone to see him.”

Rights advocates say Mr. Gao’s predicament can be partly traced to his persistent and caustic criticism of the ruling Communist Party. A self-educated lawyer, Mr. Gao, 46, was named one of China’s top 10 lawyers by the Ministry of Justice in 2001 for his work defending victims of medical malpractice and farmers whose land had been seized for redevelopment.

But Mr. Gao quickly ran afoul of the authorities when he began representing members of unofficial Christian churches and adherents of Falun Gong, the banned spiritual movement. In 2005, the Beijing judicial bureau closed his firm and suspended the licenses of its 20 lawyers. Mr. Gao countered by publicly renouncing his Communist Party membership and writing a series of open letters to senior leaders that demanded an end to the persecution of Falun Gong believers.

A week later, Mr. Gao was arrested. In a letter published just before his latest disappearance, he documented what he said happened to him during his 54 days in custody. He was shocked and beaten almost continuously, he wrote, or forced to sit motionless, enveloped by blinding lights. By the end, he said, “the skin all over my body had turned black.” He was released only after he confessed to various crimes; he retracted his confession as soon as he was let go.

A month before he vanished last February, Mr. Gao’s wife and children slipped away from their minders and, with the help of Christian activists, left China. Ten days later, they were granted asylum in the United States.

Renee Xia, the international director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said the family’s escape, coupled with the revelations of Mr. Gao’s torture, probably infuriated those charged with reining in his activities.

Given the increasingly strained relations between China and the United States, it is unclear whether Mr. Gao’s supporters abroad can have any impact on his fate. But some, like Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that Chinese leaders were still sensitive to international criticism and that a spike in global protests over Mr. Gao’s mistreatment would not go unnoticed.

“Beijing doesn’t care about releasing a prisoner or two,” he said. “It’s not going to bring about the collapse of the Communist Party but if they don’t have to do it, they won’t.”
1021 2010-02-03 Almost a decade after the State Legislature authorized a museum to honor the former Grambling State coach Eddie Robinson, it will open Feb. 13 in Grambling, La., on what would have been his 91st birthday. Robinson, who died in 2007, coached at Grambling from 1941 to 1997 and holds the Division I record for college football victories, 408.
1022 2010-02-03 The papers, including official correspondence, handwritten notes and photographs, were in the estate of Ms. Tully, who began working for Roosevelt in 1929, when he was governor of New York. She was his personal secretary from 1941 until his death in 1945, and died in 1984, at 83.

“The library had been in touch with her during her lifetime about papers, and there was some communication back and forth,” Ms. Koch said. “But the papers upon her death went into her estate and to her heirs.”

Mr. Black, whose company owned The Chicago Sun-Times and was renamed the Sun-Times Media Group in 2006, acquired the papers for around $8 million from a rare-book dealer in 2001. He had amassed a collection of Roosevelt papers in preparation for a biography he wrote, “Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom,” published by PublicAffairs in 2003.

In 2005, when Sotheby’s arranged for the sale of the papers, the auction house invited government archivists to examine them.

“That’s when we determined that they are very, very valuable papers,” Ms. Koch said.

The archivists also concluded that some of the documents might belong to the National Archives, finding that Ms. Tully’s files included materials that should not have been removed from the White House. (“It was a different era,” Ms. Koch said. “Things were a lot more casual.”)

The potential ownership claim made a sale impossible. Litigation was threatened. Negotiations began. Mr. Schumer brought together representatives of the archives, Sun-Times Media and the Internal Revenue Service.

The solution agreed upon was a bill specifying that any federal claims to the papers “are to be treated as waived and relinquished if any entity makes a gift of those documents to the National Archives and Records Administration.” The documents’ owner may take a tax deduction for the value of the full collection upon donating it. The Senate passed the bill on Oct. 14, and the House on Jan. 13.

But even as Congress acted, the Sun-Times Media Group was unraveling. Last March it filed for bankruptcy protection. In September a Chicago businessman, James C. Tyree, and a team of investors offered $5 million in cash and agreed to assume about $20 million in liabilities to take over the company’s operating assets, and the sale was completed the next month.

The Roosevelt papers were not part of that sale. Joseph H. Greenberg, a lawyer for the Chicago Newspaper Liquidation Corporation, the entity resolving the remainder of the bankruptcy, said on Tuesday that he still expected the donation to take place, though it could take some time.

“We have to make certain that we can satisfy the holders of all administrative claims,” he said in a phone interview. “It wouldn’t be prudent for us to part with an asset that may have some value.”

Mr. Greenberg added, “It’s possible we would find a third party to sell the papers to that would then donate them to the National Archives.”

He said the papers would go to the archives one way or another. “It will happen as soon as it can happen,” he said. He estimated that a resolution was a few months away.

The documents — contained in about two dozen sealed boxes — have been sitting in the library in Hyde Park since 2005 for their protection. But under a legal agreement, archivists may not open them, and researchers may not look at them.

The estimated 5,000 pages from the Tully collection are almost certainly the largest trove of Roosevelt papers still in private hands, Ms. Koch said. “We hope to get the boxes unsealed as soon as possible and to begin to process them and make them available to researchers,” she said. “We can hardly wait.”
1023 2010-02-03 So I want to spend a bunch of time hearing from you, answering your questions. But if you'll indulge me, I want to make some brief remarks on the front end.

I've had the privilege of getting to know people here in New Hampshire. I've seen firsthand that spirit of independence and spirit of self-reliance. I know how hard all of you work and how tough and resilient you are. But I also know that people here in New Hampshire have been tested by the last two years, just like people all across the country. We've gone through the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and folks here have had their lives uprooted by lost jobs and foreclosed homes, shuttered businesses, vanished savings. Many good, hardworking people who met their responsibilities are now struggling, in part because folks on Wall Street and people in Washington didn't meet their responsibilities.

So when I took office, we knew the first thing we had to do was to break the back of this recession. And sometimes that meant doing some things that weren't easy, doing some things that weren't popular. Lord knows it wasn't popular to prevent our financial system from collapsing. We had to throw a lifeline to some of the very firms that had helped cause this crisis in the first place. But it was the right thing to do, because if we hadn't taken those steps, the entire system could have gone down and taken our economy and millions of families and businesses with it. We couldn't afford that.

Because of the steps we've taken, the markets have now stabilized. Nobody's worrying about another Great Depression like they were just a year ago, and the worst of the storm has passed.

But I don't need to tell you the devastation remains. Today, one in 10 Americans still can't find work. That's why jobs has to be our number one focus in 2010. (Applause.)

And we're going to start where most new jobs start -- with small businesses. These are the companies that begin in basements and garages when an entrepreneur takes a chance on his dream, or a worker decides it's time she becomes her own boss. They're companies like ARC Energy, which I just visited before I came here. It's a terrific -- (applause) -- there you go. A little booster. (Laughter.)

Now, these folks are hard at work on a new manufacturing process for ultra-efficient LED lights that will make them more affordable for people all across the country and around the world. The technology they've created is the only one of its kind in the entire world. They're this little business just on Amherst Street, but they've got the potential to revolutionize an entire industry, right here in Nashua. Right here in Nashua. (Applause.)

Now, small businesses like ARC Energy have created roughly 65 percent of all new jobs over the past decade and a half. So we need to make it easier for them to open their doors, to expand their operations, to hire more workers. That's why I've already proposed a new tax credit for more than 1 million small businesses that hire new workers or raise wages -- and a tax incentive for all businesses, large and small, to invest in new plants and equipment. And while we're at it, we should eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, so these folks can get the capital they need to grow and create jobs. And when they start making a profit, they can put those profits back into the business.

Now, that's particularly critical right now, because bank lending standards have tightened since the financial crisis and many small businesses are still struggling to get loans.

And that's why today, I'm announcing a proposal to take $30 billion of the money that was repaid by Wall Street banks, now that they're back on their feet, take that $30 billion and use it to create a new Small Business Lending Fund that will provide capital for community banks on Main Street. (Applause.) It's the small, local banks that work most closely with small businesses. They usually provide them their first loan. They watch them through good times and bad. The more loans these smaller banks provide to creditworthy small businesses, the better deal we'll give them on capital from this fund that we've set up. And if you combine it with my proposal back in December to continue waiving fees and increasing guarantees for SBA-backed loans, all this will help small banks do even more of what our economy needs -- and that's ensure that small businesses are once again the engine of job growth in America. Now, I'm convinced we can make that happen. (Applause.)

This is just one example of what we've been doing to create jobs this past year. As some of you might remember, last February, we passed the Recovery Act, which had three parts. One-third was tax relief for small businesses and for 95 of you, 95 percent of working families. One-third of the Recovery Act was emergency relief, like increasing unemployment benefits and helping states keep teachers and police officers and firefighters from losing their jobs. And one-third was putting people to work on infrastructure and renewable energy and medical research, and more.

Now, if you hear some of the critics, they'll say, well, the Recovery Act, I don't know if that's really worked, because we still have high unemployment. But what they fail to understand is that every economist, from the left and the right, have said because of the Recovery Act, what we've started to see is at least a couple of million jobs that have either been created or would have been lost. The problem is 7 million jobs were lost during the course of this recession. So we've still got a big hole to fill. It's going to be absolutely critical that Congress acts over the next several months to make sure that we don't lose sight of the fact that even though the economy is now growing again -- almost 6 percent last quarter -- people have not started hiring again. And we've got to do everything we can to put people back to work, because we need a sustainable recovery over the long term. (Applause.)

I've got to be honest with you, there's no magic wand that makes the economic problems that were years in the making disappear overnight. And sometimes, it's easy for politicians to exploit the anger, the pain that people are feeling right now. I have to point out, though, that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act -- and claim that it hasn't worked -- have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. (Applause.) They come to the ribbon cuttings and -- (laughter.) They found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too. (Laughter.)

But look, we're making progress, but it can't come fast enough. We want to accelerate it. And we know that if we truly want to have long-term economic growth in this country, then we need to start addressing some of the struggles the middle-class families have been dealing with for years, long before this particular recession hit.

This past decade has been one of the toughest our middle class has faced in generations, because folks have seen their paychecks shrink, their housing prices fall, while the cost of everything -- from groceries to health care to college -- keeps going up. So a lot of you are working two jobs. Certainly everybody in your household is working. You're working longer hours -- but you feel like you're treading water and in some cases it's not adding up. A lot of people put their kids to bed wondering whether they'll be able to give them the opportunities in life that they got from their parents.

And the thing, New Hampshire, when I was up here campaigning, I told you -- I didn't run for President to kick these challenges down the road. I didn't run for President to play it safe. I didn't run just to keep my poll numbers as high as possible for the next election. I ran to solve problems for the next generation. (Applause.) I ran to get the hard things done. That's why you elected me. (Applause.)

So I won't rest until businesses are hiring again, and wages are rising again, and the middle class is thriving again, and we've finally got an economy that works for all Americans, not just some Americans. I won't rest until we do what we know has to be done to secure our leadership in the 21st century. I don't want to cede our future to China and India and European countries. I'm not willing to settle for second place -- not for the United States of America. (Applause.)

But if we're going to win the race, here's the thing: I can't do this alone. Democrats can't do it alone. The President can't do it alone. We've got two parties in this country, and that's a good thing. It means we've got heated debates and vigorous disagreements. And as messy as democracy sometimes is, it means bad ideas can be discarded and good ones can be refined and we don't go too far in any one extreme. That's the genius of American democracy.

So I was very pleased when the House Republican Caucus graciously invited me to attend their retreat last week. (Applause.) We had a good time for more than an hour. For more than an hour, we had a frank exchange about the issues facing our country, and we aired some of our grievances, we shared some ideas. There were plenty of things on which we didn't agree, but there were also some things on which we did, and even more things that we should agree on, if we could just focus on solving problems instead of scoring political points. (Applause.)

Now, for example, we all agree that education is the key to a 21st century economy. (Applause.) We all agree that the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education. (Applause.) So why don't we work together to transform our schools, so that every child in America can compete with their counterparts around the world, from Beijing to Bangalore. Let's work together to upgrade our community colleges, which are the gateway to a career for so many children from so many working families. (Applause.) And I know we've got a lot of young people who are about to head off to college. In an era when a high school diploma is no longer a guarantee of a good job, let's make college affordable for every qualified student. (Applause.) As I said at the State of the Union, no graduate should have to pay more than 10 percent of his or her income on student loans each year. (Applause.) We can see to it that they don't. We can see to it that they don't. We've got legislation pending right now that could make this happen.

Republicans and Democrats may not see eye to eye on the threat of global warming -- I happen to think the evidence is overwhelming. (Applause.) Some disagree. That's -- we can have a respectful argument there. But shouldn't we agree that American homegrown energy is good for our security, and that new clean energy jobs are good for our economy? (Applause.) Can't we all agree that these jobs shouldn't be going to China or Germany or Spain -- they should be right here in United States of America. (Applause.)

So let's invest in innovation. Let's put people to work on solar panels and wind towers and cutting-edge batteries. Because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and America has to be that nation. (Applause.)

These are key parts of the foundation we need to build for a better future for our families, for our country.

Another foundation stone is fixing a health insurance system that works better for insurance industry than it does for the American people. (Applause.) I do not quit. We are going to get that done. (Applause.) We've got to get it done. We have to get it done. (Applause.)

Nobody should be satisfied with a system that allows insurance companies to deny care to folks with preexisting conditions, that allows insurance companies to kick people off their plans when they get too sick. Nobody should accept a system where small businesses are forced to pay outrageous premiums to get their workers covered, and seniors have big gaps in their Medicare prescription coverage. (Applause.) Nobody should accept another decade in which health insurance premiums double and millions lose their coverage altogether. (Applause.)

There was just a report the other day that showed even greater numbers of Americans now are having to rely on government insurance, not because of my plan, but because employer-based insurance has declined to an all-time low. Now, these are the things that I hear about every day in the letters I get -- from families going bankrupt; from small businesses crushed by their health care costs. So I am not going to walk away from these efforts. I will not walk away from these people, and Congress shouldn't either. (Applause.) We should keep working to get it done -- Democrats and Republicans together, let's get it done this year. (Applause.)

Now, finally, we should all be able to agree that we've got to do something about our long-term deficits. Now, these deficits won't just burden our kids and our grandkids decades from now -- they could damage our markets now, they could drive up our interest rates now, they could jeopardize our recovery right now.

Responsible families don't do their budgets the way the federal government does. Right? When times are tough, you tighten your belts. You don't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don't blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you're trying to save for college. You prioritize. You make tough choices. It's time your government did the same. (Applause.)

Now, that's why I continue to insist on making investments for job growth this year, why I continue to insist that we put more money into education; that's why I say we put more money into science and technology for innovation. (Applause.) That's why I continue to believe that we've got to invest in our infrastructure so that we are building the kind of America that can compete in the 21st century. Those are smart investments. That's like buying the new boiler -- if it's busted, you got to get a new boiler. If the roof's leaking, you got to fix the roof. There's some things you've got to do.

But you can put off buying the new curtains, even if it'd be nice to have. You know, that -- remodeling the bathroom, I mean, everything is working. You don't need it right now. I mean, what we've been having are folks who want to buy the curtains but don't want to fix the boiler. (Applause.) And our priorities have to change.

That's why I proposed cutting more than 120 government programs -- consolidating ones that are duplicative, reducing ones that are wasteful, eliminating those that just don't work. (Applause.) That's why I proposed to cap government spending over the next three years. Spending related to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and our national security will not be affected. (Applause.) But all other discretionary government programs will. That doesn't mean we have to do less. It just means we've got to do more with the money we've got. That's why I'm grateful that both the House and the Senate have now voted to reinstate what's called the PAYGO rule. It's a very novel concept. It means "pay as you go." (Laughter and applause.) By the way, that is not to be confused with Paul Hodes's wife Peggo. (Applause.) That's a different -- although I really like her, too.

So the PAYGO rule helped create those record surpluses back in the 1990s. You remember that? That was way back when -- (laughter) -- instead of the record deficits that we had when I came into office. And the concept here is, as I said, is it's very simple. You want to start a new program? Go ahead. But you've got to cut another one to pay for it. That's how we'll make sure we're spending your money wisely. You want to cut taxes for somebody? That might be a good idea, but you got to find a way to close the revenue hole, so that everything actually adds up. That's how we'll get our deficit under control. That's something that Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree to -- if we could just stop playing politics, get past the Washington game. (Applause.)

Now, let me just -- let me just give you an example here, because we released the budget, right way the other side says, oh, look at all these trillions of dollars of debt -- absolutely. I mean, I'm concerned about it very much. It keeps me awake at night, looking at all that red ink. Most of it is structural and we inherited it. The only way that we are going to fix it is if both parties come together and start making some tough decisions about our long-term priorities.

But last week, the Senate blocked a law that I had supported to create a bipartisan fiscal commission that would come up with a set of recommendations for cutting our deficits in the long term. This is a difficult thing. It's only going to be solved if we do it together. This law failed by seven votes when seven Republicans who had co-sponsored the bill -- had co-sponsored the idea -- suddenly walked away from their own proposal after I endorsed it. (Laughter.) So, they make a proposal. They sign on to the bill. I say, great, good idea. I turn around -- (laughter) -- they're gone. What happened? (Laughter.) Look, it's one thing to have an honest difference of opinion on something. There's nothing wrong with that. But you can't walk away from your responsibilities to confront the challenges facing the country, because you don't think it's good short-term politics. We can't afford that. (Applause.) We can't afford that. (Applause.)

The message you all sent when you elected me, the message that was sent this past month -- whether you're Democrat, Republican, independent -- you're out of patience. You're out of patience with this kind of business as usual. You want us to start worrying less about our jobs and more about your jobs. (Applause.) You want us to worry less about our election and more about solving your problems. And for once, you'd like a government that reflects a sense of responsibility and decency and generosity, because that's how you try to live your lives. (Applause.)

That's the spirit that led students here at Nashua North to spring into action in the wake of the tragedy in Haiti. And I want to congratulate you guys for planning fundraisers and selling ribbons and collecting money at lunch -- all to help folks that they've never known in a place that most of them have never been. (Applause.) We're proud of you for that. That's good work. That's good work. (Applause.)

It's that same spirit that drives small business owners like Tim, and like Kedar Gupta, the CEO of ARC Energy. I told you about him, I told you about the company. These are the two guys who are running it right here. Now, Kedar founded ARC, but he also, years before, co-founded a company called GT Solar with just $1,000. It now has 343 employees, hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. And as he was growing that company, nursing it from $1,000, he made sure his employees shared in the company's profits. When the company hit hard times, he cut his own salary first. When talking about his business philosophy, he explains that many CEOs take a "me, me and me" approach. But his approach has been "we" -- not about benefiting just himself, but lifting his employees too, and his community. (Applause.)

We need that kind of spirit. We've come through a tough year and a tough decade, but that fundamental decency, that sense of determination, that grit, that willingness to work hard in pursuit of a good idea, the determination to do what's right -- that's been at the core of the American experience. And that should fill us all with optimism about what lies ahead. So let's put aside the small things. Let's come together. Let's do what's hard. Let's welcome what's hard. Let's welcome the challenge. Let's do what's necessary to help the middle class succeed again; to give our shot -- our kids a shot at their dreams again; and to fulfill the promise of this great country in our time, in our generation. That's our test. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)

Okay. You know, when in New England, we got to do the town hall. (Laughter.) You guys have been -- thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. God bless you. (Applause.)

Now, a lot of you guys have been in these before, so you know the drill. I'm going to call girl, boy, girl, boy. (Laughter.) There are microphones in the audience, and I will try to get in as many questions as possible. And it would be nice if you introduce yourself so that people know who you are. And don't yell out. Just raise your hand and I'll call on you -- although she seems very eager, so go ahead. All right, we're going to start right around here.

THE PRESIDENT: Hey. Uh-oh. How did this Connecticut person sneak in here? All right, go ahead. I love people in Connecticut. Go ahead.

Q: Due to the great health care in this country I am a three-time cancer survivor. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: We're proud of you.

Q: But like many cancer patients was pushed out of a job. I was lucky enough to be able to retire early, buy into the retirees' health plan and then start my own successful business. (Applause.) However, this is not the case for most people with chronic illnesses. Health care for cancer survivors is more expensive. How are the jobs bill and the proposed health care legislation going to account for the level of variability of the needs of cancer survivors?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, first of all, we're proud of you, you look great. You say you agree? (Laughter.) You should.

THE PRESIDENT: No, you look good, too -- go ahead.

THE PRESIDENT: There are a couple of aspects of this. First of all I think we shouldn't lose sight of the enormous potential in the new branches of medicine to go after cancer. I was over at NIH, National Institute for Health. We've increased funding drastically. This is an area that should be one of our competitive advantages, right? We have the best scientists in the world. We've got the best universities in the world. We have traditionally led in innovation. And the more money we're putting in, they're starting to come up with drugs that only kill the cancer cells and don't kill healthy cells, or that can be tailored to a particular kind of cancer that's matched up because of new genetic information. So there's enormous potential here to go after cures and that involves the kind of research and investment that we've made.

In our health care bill, one of the most important components was the idea, the basic principle that nobody should have to go without health insurance because of a preexisting condition. (Applause.) Nobody should have to go after -- go without health insurance without -- because of a preexisting condition. Now, this is something that's very popular if you just say it in isolation, but when you start explaining what is required to make that happen, then sometimes some people get a little nervous. You can't have insurance companies have to take somebody who's sick, who's got a preexisting condition, if you don't have everybody covered, or at least almost everybody covered.

And the reason, if you think about it, is simple. If you had a situation where not everybody was covered but an insurance company had to take you because you were sick, what everybody would do is they'd just wait till they got sick and then they'd go buy insurance. Right? And so the potential would be there to game the system.

The reason I point that out is because a lot of the reforms that we've proposed fit together. So we want insurance reforms that make sure that a cancer survivor can still get health insurance. But to do that, we want to make sure that everybody has health insurance, which in turn allows us to cut back on some wasteful spending and help upgrade hospitals and doctors and how they perform medicine because now they're not dealing with as many emergency room patients.

So the cost control aspects of it, the coverage aspects of it, and the insurance reform aspects of it all fit together.

Here's the problem, though, is when you've got all those things fitting together it ends up being a big, complicated bill and it's very easy to scare the daylights out of people. And that's basically what happened during the course of this year's debate. But here's the good news: We're essentially on the five-yard line -- for those who like football analogies. So we've had to go into overtime, but we are now in the red zone, that's exactly right. We're in the red zone. We've got to punch it through.

What I have said is that both the House bill and the Senate bill were 90 percent there. Ten percent of each bill, people had some problems with, and legitimately so. So we were just about to clean those up, and then Massachusetts' election happened. Suddenly everybody says, oh, oh, it's over. Well, no, it's not over. We just have to make sure that we move methodically and that the American people understand exactly what's in the bill.

And what I've done is I've said to the Republicans, show me what you've got. You've been sitting on the sidelines criticizing what we're proposing. I'm happy to defend insurance reforms; I'm happy to defend the fact that we need to provide 30 million people with access to coverage; I'm happy to defend the need to provide small businesses an ability to pool so that they can have the same purchasing power that the big companies have and drive down their premiums and drive down their rates for their employees. I'm happy to have these debates. I just want to see what else you got. And if you've got a good idea, great.

At the Republican caucus, they held up -- they said, we've got a plan; it's going to provide everybody coverage at no cost. And I said, well, if that were true, why wouldn't I take it? My wife Michelle thinks I'm stubborn sometimes, but I'm not that stubborn. Okay, let me think. I could have everybody get health care coverage that's high quality, and it's free, which I'll bet is really popular. But I'm not going to do that. I'm going to go through the pain of really working through this hard process in Congress, getting yelled at and called a socialist, because I just -- that's how I roll. I'm a glutton for punishment. (Laughter.)

No, look, if this were easy and simple, first of all, somebody would have done it before. Seven Presidents have failed at this; seven Congresses have failed at this. If this was simple, it would have already been done. It's not.

This is one-sixth of our economy; it's extremely complex. But I want everybody to understand here: The health care proposal we put forward is basically the same shape as the proposal that was put forward by Tom Daschle, former Senate Democratic Majority Leader; Bob Dole and Howard Baker, two Republican Senate leaders.

So it can't be that radical. It's a very straightforward principle that says we're going to set up an exchange, a pool, where people who don't have health insurance and small businesses who can't afford it right now can buy into the pool. If even after we've driven premiums down because of increased competition and choice, you still can't afford it, we're going to give you a subsidy, depending on your income. We're going to ask that everybody get health insurance, but if you still can't afford it we'll exempt you, we'll give you a hardship exemption, because there are some folks, you know, that it's just too tough.

We are going to insist that the insurance companies all abide by certain practices like making sure that you take people with preexisting conditions, that you don't drop people just because they get sick.

We then say that we have to control the costs of medicine, so we're going to set up a panel of experts -- doctors and health care economists -- who are going to scrutinize how we reimburse things like Medicare to make sure that doctors are encouraged to work as teams -- don't order five tests if you could just do one test and then e-mail it to five different doctors. Pretty straightforward.

Now, what I just described is the essence of what we're doing. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, it would save $1 trillion in our deficits, which is the single most important thing we can do, by the way, to reduce our deficit over the long term.

Almost all the growth in deficit has nothing to do with my Recovery Act, and has everything to do with the growing costs of Medicare and Medicaid. Almost all of it. You project out 20-30 years -- almost all the growth is because health care costs are just going out of control and we've got an older population that's going to need more care. And if we can't figure out how to get a better bang for the buck, we're going to lose.

So here's my thing: You got a better idea? Bring it on. But what I will not do is to stop working on this issue -- because it is the right thing to do for America and you need to let your members of Congress know they shouldn't give up, they should keep on pushing to make it happen. (Applause.)

All right. Okay. All right. It's a guy's turn. It's a gentleman's turn. This gentleman right here in front. Go ahead -- hold on one second, we've got a mic coming over here.

Q: I'm Gary Meyer. I live in Hampton, New Hampshire, and I was a quality leader who worked with (inaudible). And I know you're well aware that there's a lot of non-valuated work both within health care, within education, and within a lot of businesses and government. You also talked eloquently about the need to have more jobs and to be more energy efficient. All these things together require that we get a health care act reform passed in the Senate, a better one than we have today, and that we also get a clean air act passed. Would you be willing to meet one on one with Senator Gregg to get these things passed in the Senate?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I wasn't -- I'm willing to meet with anybody, including Senator Gregg, who I offered a job to. (Laughter.) I don't know if you guys remember that. (Applause.) I like Senator Gregg. I think he is a -- he is a serious person. But you know that fiscal commission that I just talked about, that was Gregg's proposal. That was his proposal. It was Senator Judd Gregg and Senator Kent Conrad. And they had been advocating for this for years. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate -- Republican Leader had just a few months ago said this was the way to deal with this. So I said, great, let's do it. And, suddenly, they're gone -- not Judd, Judd is still supportive of it. So what we're going to try to do -- we're going to try to do it by executive order.

My point is the easiest thing to do in politics is to point fingers, to figure out who to blame for something, or to make people afraid of things. That's the easiest way to get attention. That's what reporters will report on. You call somebody a name, you say, look what a terrible thing they've done and they're going to do more terrible things to you if you don't watch out. And you'll get a lot of press attention. And, in some cases, you can win elections, particularly when unemployment is 10 percent.

What's hard is to figure out how to solve these problems. Our long-term deficit, if we can't control health care costs -- I don't care who's talking about eliminating waste from the government, we can't solve the problem. A lot of people just -- let me just give you one example. If you ask a lot of folks what accounts for the federal budget, they'll say foreign aid and pork projects, and if you just eliminated all the foreign aid and the pork projects, somehow we'd bring our deficit under control. Foreign aid accounts for about 1 percent of our federal budget -- 1 percent, not 25 percent, not 20 [percent] -- 1 percent. Earmarks -- all these pork projects -- a lot of them, by the way, people like, a lot of them are wastes of money, and we got to be able to distinguish between the two and make it more transparent so that they're not stuck into bills without anybody knowing about it -- (applause) -- but they only cost -- they amount to about 1 percent of the budget as well.

What really accounts for our federal budget is Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, defense, interest on the national debt, and then everything else, from national parks to the environmental -- the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. And in order -- if you just wanted to cut the deficit to balance the budget, only on non-discretionary -- or on discretionary non-defense spending -- so if you wanted to exempt out all the entitlements, exempt defense, you'd have to cut all those other things by 60 percent -- 60 percent. Can you imagine?

So we've got to have an honest conversation about all the aspects of the budget, and that's what this commission was designed to do. That's why I think Judd Gregg was absolutely right. I support him on this. And we're going to set up an executive -- by executive order a commission to do this.

But I want good ideas. It is not in my interest to bloat government with wasteful programs, because every time I spend money on a program that doesn't work, that's money that I'm not spending on early childhood education that would make a difference in a child's life -- (applause) -- or on college scholarships to send kids to school. We've got to use our money more wisely. But that can only be done if both parties are responding to the interests of the American people and not their short-term politics.

All right, let's see, a woman's turn. That young lady up there. Yes, you -- yes. You sound surprised. (Laughter.) Oh, wait, wait, wait, I was calling on this young lady in the black blouse right here, I'm sorry. Sorry about that, but it's nice to see you, though. I may call on you in a second. (Laughter.) Go ahead.

Q: My name is Ashley Sevins (phonetic) and I live here in Nashua and attend Nashua High South. (Applause.) There were a lot of -- during your campaign, there was a lot of promises of transparency, but lately a lot of stuff in the media said that most of health care has been behind closed doors. I was just wondering how you would grade yourself on your transparent government.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, I've got to be careful about grading myself. (Laughter.) But I will tell you that a recent independent watchdog group took a look and said this has been the most transparent government, most transparent administration, that we have seen in a very, very long time, perhaps in the modern era. (Applause.)

And here's the reason. Let me just list off the things we've done. This is the first White House ever where you know every single person who visits the White House. Now, that seems like a small thing, but that means any lobbyist, any company -- anybody who comes to visit the White House, you know who it is.

The Recovery Act that I just talked about -- we put every dollar of spending in the Recovery Act on a Web site. You can go and look up right now every dollar that's been spent in the Recovery Act. You know where it's been spent, who got contracts, how it's been spent. That's all there, plain as day, for everybody to see.

So we've put more information online. We declassified things that used to be classified. We've revamped the classification system so it's not used for us to just hide things that might be embarrassing to us. We posted salaries for everybody in the White House all on a Web site, which as you might imagine, when it comes out, everybody is looking in the White House. (Laughter.) Hmmm. (Laughter.)

But seriously, we very much believe in transparency and accountability.

Now, when it came to the debate, think about all the hours of congressional hearings, all the meetings that were on C-SPAN. They were constant. It took a year, remember? I did town hall meetings all across the country in August talking just about health care. So when people say, well, the negotiations weren't on C-SPAN, what they're frustrated about -- and I take responsibility for this -- is that after Congress had finally gone through its processes, the House had voted on a bill, the Senate had voted on a bill, it is true that I then met with the leaders and chairmen of the House and the Senate to see what differences needed to be resolved in order to get a final package done. And that wasn't on C-SPAN.

And, look, I made that commitment and I probably should have put it on C-SPAN, although one of the tricky things is trying to figure out, well, if it is on C-SPAN, are people actually going to be saying what they think about trying to get the bill done or is everybody going to be posturing to say things that sound good for the camera.

But I think it is a legitimate criticism to say, if you say that all of it is going to be on C-SPAN, all of it is going to be on C-SPAN. Which is why, at this point, it's important for me to say that when the Republicans put forward their proposals for what they want to do on health care, and we put forward what we want to do on health care, I very much want that on C-SPAN, and I want everybody here to watch. (Applause.) I want everybody here to watch. Because I think it will be a good educational process for people to weigh the arguments about the relative merits of the bill instead of listening to millions of dollars' worth of insurance industry ads that have been put out there or whatever pundit on the left or the right is saying about these different issues.

So we're going to keep on doing it. Have we gotten it perfect? No. Have we done better than any administration in recent memory? Absolutely. And we'll keep on trying to improve on it.

All right? Good. (Applause.) It's a gentleman's turn. This gentleman there in the back, in the tie. He got all spruced up for the meeting; I want to make sure I call on him.

Q: My name is Dick Swett, I live in Bow, New Hampshire. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: Hey, Dick, you got a big fan club here.

Q: I used to occupy the seat that Paul Hodes holds now, and he's doing a great job.

Q: He is. First of all, thank you for coming to New Hampshire. We are very pleased and proud that you're here. And we are grateful for the opportunity to talk.

Now, in your discussions, you have said that you're ready to listen to anybody with a good idea. Well, I'd like to go out on a limb and say I think I've got a good idea; I'd like to share it with you.

THE PRESIDENT: Good, please do.

Q: When we talk about energy issues in this country, we are talking about jobs; we're talking about dependence on international oil, some coming from difficult places that are feeding terrorist organizations that are causing harm to our citizens; we are talking about a problem of keeping our money here at home as opposed to send it overseas when we purchase that foreign oil.

I think what we can do is we need to put all of these issues together in one basket, and first set a date by which time we can be independent enough of foreign oil; I can't say that we could be completely independent, and I think you understand the reasons why.

But if we can invest in technology here at home, to develop clean technology, place that technology in developing countries, not only just where they can have energy and electricity to be productive with, but establish with that an economic system where they have jobs and they are opening up new markets that we can sell our products into and that we can build our relationships with their leaders through.

And at home, if we can focus on making ourselves more energy efficient, because we are a very inefficient country when it comes to the use of energy, just like all of the industrialized countries. These two things, I think, done first can help us to avoid having to do cap and trade and other aspects with environmental controls that are going to have negative impacts on our economy. We need to make productive use of our technology and our people so that we can clean up the economy, put people to work, and then if that isn't sufficient enough, we then go to the kinds of programs that have been talked about at the Copenhagen summit. (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me respond by talking more broadly about energy. First of all, those are such good ideas I've already adopted them, although I didn't know they came from you. (Laughter.)

Number one, we have to invest in innovation and new technologies. There's no doubt about it. And by the way, we've got to upgrade some old technologies. I know it's controversial in some quarters, but if you're serious about dealing with climate change then you've got to take a serious look at the nuclear industry. If you are serious about climate change, you've got to figure out is there technology that can allow us to sequester coal and the emissions that are set out.

The reason for that is not just for the United States. China is building a coal-fired plant once a week, just about --India is doing the same -- because coal is cheap. And unless we can come up with some energy alternatives that allow us to franchise that technology so that they are equipped to burn that coal cleanly, we're going to have problems no matter what we do in this country when it comes to the environment. So technology is key. And, by the way, we can make significant profits and create huge jobs just upgrading traditional technologies. Then you've got the whole clean energy sector, which is ready to take off if we provide the kind of seed capital, the kind of R&D credits that are necessary.

This past recession almost killed a lot of our homegrown clean energy sectors. And the industry will tell you. You talk to the wind industry or the solar industry, if we hadn't passed the Recovery Act and all the support for clean energy, a lot of them would have completely gone under and we would have been ceding leadership as we already have, unfortunately, to a lot of countries like Spain and Germany and Japan that are doing a lot more work on it. So this is a huge engine for job creation, and we've got to make those investments.

The third thing you said, energy efficiency. We are one of the least efficient advanced economies when it comes to energy usage. And it's estimated that we could probably lop off 30 percent of our energy consumption just on efficiency without changing our lifestyles significantly. I say "significantly" because you'd have to start buying LED batteries or LED light bulbs. But it's still a light bulb. You don't have to sit in the dark. You don't have to use gas lanterns. You just have to make the investment. And one of the things that a company like ARC Energy is doing is trying to bring down the unit cost for each of those light bulbs.

A school building like this, guarantee you that we could make this school probably 10-15-20 percent more energy efficient. But the problem is school budgets a lot of times don't have the money to put the capital up front to make it more energy efficient. So are there ways we can help universities and schools and other institutions -- more efficient? We could retrofit every building in this country that was built over the last 50 years and get huge increases in energy, huge decreases in greenhouse gas emissions. But it requires some seed money. It requires some work. And that's why part of our jobs package is actually -- it's a very simple concept: Hire people to weatherize homes that will save those homeowners' heating bills, or cooling bills, and at the same time put people back to work and train them in things like insulation and heating systems. So there's a lot of opportunity there.

Now, here's the only thing I would say. The most controversial aspects of the energy debate that we've been having -- the House passed an energy bill and people complained about, well, there's this cap and trade thing. And you just mentioned, let's do the fun stuff before we do the hard stuff. The only thing I would say about it is this: We may be able to separate these things out. And it's conceivable that that's where the Senate ends up. But the concept of incentivizing clean energy so that it's the cheaper, more effective kind of energy is one that is proven to work and is actually a market-based approach. A lot of times, people just respond to incentives. And no matter how good the technology is, the fact of the matter is if you're not factoring in the soot that's being put in the atmosphere, coal is going to be cheaper for a very long time. For the average industry, the average company, we can make huge progress on solar, we can make huge progress on wind, but the unit costs -- energy costs that you get from those technologies relative to coal are still going to be pretty substantial. They're going to get better, but it might take 20-30-40 years of technology to get better.

And so the question then is: Does it make sense for us to start pricing in the fact that this thing is really bad for the environment? And if we do, then can we do it in a way that doesn't involve some big bureaucracy in a control and command system, but just says, look, we're just going to -- there's going to be a price to pollution. And then everybody can adapt and decide which are the -- which are the best energies. And that's -- that's, by the way, remember acid rain? That's how that got solved, was basically what happened -- the Clean Air Act slapped a price on sulfur emissions. And what ended up happening was all these companies who were saying this was going to be a jobs killer, et cetera, they figured it out. They figured it out a lot cheaper than anybody expected. And it turns out now that our trees are okay up here in New Hampshire. That's a good thing. So we should take a lesson from the past and not be afraid of the future. (Applause.)

There's a signal that I only have time for a few more questions. I'm going to try to take two more. It is a young lady's turn. I shouldn't be biased against the folks back here. Here you go.

Q: Hi. I'm Judy Loftus. I teach at Nashua South High School. (Applause.) I teach in the careers and education program, and that's a career and technical program that prepares students for lives working -- to work with children, to make a difference, from pre-school up to elementary age.

I have a couple of questions. First of all, what are you going to do about No Child Left Behind? We've had a lot of legacies from the last administration. And as an educator I've seen the impact of that in my school and it hasn't been a positive impact. We're focused more on testing and worrying about test scores than what's right for kids. (Applause.)

And the second is, what are you going to do to help my students, who want to be teachers, who want to make a difference in this world, be able to afford a college education and not be saddled with so much debt that they're working -- as many teachers in Nashua are -- two jobs, to make ends meet to pay their student loans? (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT: It's a good question. The short-term proposals that I put forward are designed to accelerate job growth, that inspire a company that's right on the brink of hiring but it's still kind of uncertain: Should I make that investment, should I bring in somebody out of the workforce? Well, maybe if I get a $5,000 credit or maybe if I can get a loan from SBA, I'm going to go ahead and take the plunge. So we're trying to induce hiring to start a little quicker than it's been -- than has taken place so far.

But long term, the question you ask is the most vital one for how our economy performs. Look, this is a very straightforward proposition here. Countries that have a highly skilled workforce, that innovate, that excel in science and technology, are going to dominate the future. And countries that don't are going to see, over time, their standard of living decline. It's pretty straightforward. If we're the country that's innovating and creating new products and at the high end of the product chain, then everybody here is going to have enormous opportunity. And if we're not, we don't.

So what does that mean? On the education front, our elementary schools, our secondary schools, have been slipping. We used to have the best; now we have pockets of the best, and then we have mediocrity, and then we have some schools that are just terrible. We've got to make sure every child is getting a good, solid education. (Applause.) And what that means is, it means we continue to invest in early childhood education, which my budget does. It means -- so that our kids are prepared when they start school. It means that we help schools with just their basic budgets. And as I said, the Recovery Act prevented a lot of layoffs and really patched holes in a lot of school budgets. It's not sexy, it doesn't get a lot of credit, but it made a huge difference.

We've got to make sure, though, also, that the single most important factor in an elementary and secondary school education is fulfilled, and that is, we've got excellent teachers in the classroom who are getting paid a good salary and are getting the support that they need. (Applause.)

Now, traditionally what's happened is the debate between the left and the right has said, well, the left just says, we just need more money in the schools and everything will be okay -- you know, it's for new equipment, new computers, smaller class sizes. That's been the argument on the liberal side. The conservative side has said, the whole problem is bureaucracy, teachers' unions -- you got to blow up the system. What my administration believes is, it's not an either/or proposition, it's both/and. We need more money, but we need to spend the money wisely and we need to institute reforms that raise standards and push everybody in a school -- principal, teacher, student, parent -- to pursue excellence.

So last year what we did is we started with something called Race to the Top, and it's a pretty simple proposition. We carved out a little bit of money that doesn't just go to general revenue -- Title I, all the general federal support for schools -- and we said, this money, this Race to the Top money, you get it only if you're working to make for excellent teachers, you're collecting good data to make sure that your students are actually making progress in the schools, you're dealing with the lowest-performing schools in your school district. You've got ideas that are showing concrete results in improvement, not in absolute test scores, but in the progress that that school is making, we're going to fund those improvements.

And we've already seen reforms across 48 states, just because we incentivized reform. That's a good thing.

This year is when reauthorization for what's called No Child [Left] Behind would be coming up, as part of the broader education legislation that's up for reauthorization. And what we're saying there is, on the one hand, we don't want teachers just teaching to the test; on the other hand, we also want to keep high standards for our kids. And I think the best way to do that is to combine high standards, measurable outcomes, but have an assessment system that you work with teachers on so that it's not just a matter of who's filling out a bubble, and you're also taking into account where do kids start, because not every kid is going to start at the same place. So you want to see where do they end up at the end of the year. (Applause.)

So I just -- I just had a meeting with my team this week about this, trying to find ways that we can improve the assessment system so we're still holding schools accountable, we're still holding teachers accountable, but we're not just holding them accountable for a score on a standardized test, but we have a richer way of assessing whether these schools are making progress.

All right, so that's the answer to the No Child Left Behind.

On the college front, here's the deal. We've already increased Pell grants, and we want to increase them again. (Applause.) We've already increased both the size of each grant that's permissible, but also the number of grants available so more students can get to them. The next step -- and this is legislation that's pending that we are strongly supportive of and I think our entire congressional delegation from New Hampshire is strongly supportive of -- what it would do is it would say to every student all across America, and this is especially important for somebody who wants to go into teaching -- not a high-salary profession -- that you will never have to pay more than 10 percent of your income on student loans. (Applause.) And to every student, we would say that after 20 years your debt would be forgiven as long as you were making payments commensurate with your income. But if you went into public service, we would forgive those student loans after 10 years. (Applause.) And teaching obviously is one of our most important public services.

So we think this is a fair deal because what is says is you won't go bankrupt if you decide to go to college, but what it also says is you can make the choice for the lower salary but greater fulfillment, greater satisfaction pursuing your passion -- you can do that and it's not going to be cost-prohibitive.

Now, you may ask, how are we going to pay for it? Remember, we were -- we said we're going to pay for everything from here on out, pay as you go -- PAYGO. Right? So here's how we're going to do it. It turns out that right now a lot of the student loan programs are still run through financial institutions and banks. So you got this middle man and they get billions of dollars per year managing loans that are guaranteed by the federal government. So think about this. You, the taxpayers, are guaranteeing that this is going to be paid back. These institutions are essentially taking no risks, and yet they're still extracting these huge profits.

And what we've said is, look, cut out the middle man. You take those billions of dollars, give it directly to the students; with the money that we save, we can make sure that nobody goes bankrupt because they're going to college, because we need every single person to go to college. We think it's a good idea. We're going to make it happen. (Applause.)

All right. I've only got -- I got one last question. Oh, and it's a guy's turn. It's a guy's turn. All right, this gentlemen over here. We figured -- are you a student? Oh, you look like a student. That's why I called on you. (Laughter.) You've got a baby face.

Q: It's my young face. Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Ronnie Camile (phonetic), I live in Nashua, New Hampshire. Three weeks ago, as you know, there was an earthquake in Haiti. I traveled to Haiti to visit my family. And I know times are tough for the American people. And, as President, what will you do to ensure that Haiti will be continued -- will receive help, because many people down there have yet to receive help?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I appreciate that you went down. I appreciate what the students did here at Nashua North. (Applause.) There's been an outpouring of incredible generosity in response to this earthquake, and it's a testament to the American people. Our military and our government has responded, I believe, in exemplary fashion. We got Marines and aid workers and helicopters and food and clean water facilities -- we got those down in record time. The devastation, and the fact that Haiti already had such poor infrastructure to begin with, makes it that much harder. So, yes, there are still a lot of people there who are going through enormous hardship. But America should be proud of what we've done so far. We really should. (Applause.)

Now, part of the point you're making though is, you know, the headlines start to drift in another direction, right? So, it was 24/7 Haiti for about a week, and then the media decided it was time to move on to something else, so now you're not hearing about it as much. And what can happen is that everybody's memories of the devastation start fading away, and then pretty soon people are asking: Why are we giving money to Haiti? So what we have to do is to build a strong consensus around a long-term recovery plan for Haiti that is not just shouldered by the United States but the entire international community. (Applause.) I'm going to be working with countries like France and Brazil and Canada, the European Union, Japan, China. We want to get countries that have capacity and resources to come together with the United Nations, with the Haitian government, to determine how can we see if out of this incredible tragedy we can start actually rebuilding in a way that makes life even better for people over the long term than it was before the earthquake. And that's going to require improving our schools, that's going to require improving the infrastructure in Haiti, that's going to require providing the ability of Haitians to sell their products like textiles into advanced countries at an advantageous situation so that they can start rebuilding their commerce and their industry.

It's in our interest to do so, though. I want everybody to do it. We do it because it's right, but we also do it because when the United States sends the USS Vinson to Haiti to allow a bunch of helicopters to unload food and Marines or -- helping and we've got a hospital that's set up -- that sends a message of American power that is so important, because too often what other countries think of when they think of the United States and our military is just war.

But when they see us devoting these resources and the incredible capacity that we have to help people in desperate need, that message ripples across the world. And it means that when you've got a guy like bin Laden out there screaming, "blow up America," it's a lot harder for that seed to take root when people have been seeing images of America making sure that people in desperate need are helped. (Applause.) So it's part of our national security. It's a smart thing to do. It's great to see you, Nashua. I love you guys. Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause.)
1024 2010-02-03 In an opinion released on Tuesday, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed all of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s civil fraud complaints against Cohmad Securities, a small brokerage firm that the S.E.C. said had played a role in Bernard L. Madoff’s long-running Ponzi scheme.

The commission had sued the Cohmad and its top executives in June, accusing them of “knowingly or recklessly participating” in the Madoff fraud scheme “by raising billions of dollars from hundreds of investors under a shroud of secrecy.”

The lawsuit was filedagainst Cohmad, which was co-founded by Mr. Madoff and housed in his firm’s offices; Maurice J. Cohn, Cohmad’s co-founder and chairman; Marcia B. Cohn, its president and Mr. Cohn’s daughter; and Robert M. Jaffe, its vice president and the son-in-law of one of Mr. Madoff’s earliest and largest individual investors, philanthropist Carl Shapiro of Palm Beach, Fla.

In his ruling, apparently filed late Monday, Federal District Judge Louis L. Stanton said the commission “failed to allege facts giving rise to a plausible inference” that either the Cohns or Mr. Jaffe intended to defraud anyone, or had knowingly aided and abetted Mr. Madoff’s fraud.

“One who conducts normal business activities while ignorant that those activities are furthering a fraud is not liable for securities fraud,” Judge Stanton said.
1025 2010-02-03 KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — There may have been little progress inside the courtroom on Tuesday, but there was no shortage of drama outside on what was to have been the first day of the new sodomy trial of the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.

As his supporters rallied at the Kuala Lumpur High Court, Mr. Anwar, who is accused of sodomizing a former campaign worker, said he planned to subpoena the prime minister, Najib Razak, and his wife.

Mr. Anwar, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, said he had evidence that his accuser, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, visited the prime minister and his wife shortly before he made the complaint in 2008.

“We have evidence that he was involved,” Mr. Anwar said, referring to the prime minister. “He met Saiful two days before the report was lodged to the police.”

Mr. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, was convicted of sodomy and abuse of power in an earlier case, in 1998. Although the sodomy conviction was later overturned, he spent six years in prison. He argues that the new sodomy charge is another attempt to end his political career.
1026 2010-02-03 BEIJING — China has begun a 10-day emergency inspection of dairy products because of reports that tainted items the government ordered destroyed during a food safety scandal in 2008 were still on the market, the official newspaper China Daily reported Tuesday.

The suspect dairy products contain melamine, an industrial chemical added to the products to give them the appearance of having greater nutritional value. The chemical, which can cause kidney stones in infants, led to the deaths of at least six children and sickened 300,000 people in 2008, according to the Chinese government.

Melamine was discovered in a wide range of dairy products after the scandal erupted in September 2008.

The government ordered all suspect products to be recalled and destroyed, but some “unscrupulous” companies have taken the recalled products and repackaged them for sale, Health Minister Chen Zhu said during a teleconference call over the weekend, according to China Daily.

Melamine-laced milk powder has resurfaced mostly as an ingredient in processed food like ice cream and condensed milk, the newspaper said.
1027 2010-02-03 A recipe for Scallop Gumbo....
1028 2010-02-03 GUMBO, the Southern stew, is like many regional dishes: there are nearly as many interpretations as there are cooks. Most include the common Louisiana trinity of vegetables: green peppers, celery and onion.

Some include meat, often a spicy sausage like andouille, in addition to or in place of shellfish. And while some gumbos rely on okra as a thickener, others use a roux, a combination of flour and fat cooked until brown and tasty.

What I like about this gumbo is that it borrows a little from many approaches to create a lighter, more contemporary dish: a one-pot meal that’s ideal for any occasion calling for a crowd-pleaser.

The scallops (you could use shrimp or other shellfish) add a bit of elegance, but not so much that you lose the real character of a gumbo, the aromatic vegetables as well as herbs, tomatoes and cayenne.

The roux is the most labor-intensive part of this recipe, but even though it’s a small amount it creates a silky, rich stew rather than a superthick one; it’s worth the effort. Keep the heat low and whisk the roux constantly, and you should be fine.

Once the roux browns, it’s simply a matter of adding the vegetables, stock and aromatics and giving the flavors time to meld.

1044 2010-02-04 Bob Herbert rightly calls the New York Police Department’s policy of stopping and frisking hundreds of thousands of innocent black and Latino New Yorkers every year “Jim Crow policing” (column, Feb. 2). And to make matters worse, these innocent people are subjected to the added injustice of having their personal information stored indefinitely in a sprawling N.Y.P.D. database.

This vast database contains personal details of more than 2.2 million completely innocent people stopped by the police since 2004. Nine out of 10 are never arrested, charged or even issued a summons.

What is the N.Y.P.D. doing with this huge database? Growing its list of the “usual suspects” and turning hundreds of thousands of innocent black and brown New Yorkers into investigation targets.

The police can and should stop people engaged in suspicious activity, but they must not stop innocent people simply to collect their information. The N.Y.P.D. should scale back its stop-and-frisk activity, and wipe the information on millions of innocent people from its database. Failure to do so will undermine trust and raise the prospect of court orders and Justice Department intervention. Donna Lieberman

1045 2010-02-04 It is typical, more’s the pity, that we humans should embrace the policy of debarking dogs to make our lives quieter — in noisy cities yet! Dogs love to bark, but even more, they love to be with us intolerant humans.

Isn’t that gift, given so freely, enough?

I lived in an Upper West Side apartment for 14 years with my family and two dogs. A few neighbors complained, but most were fine. One night, one of the dogs kept barking until we realized that some cloth next to a heat pipe at the other end of the apartment was smoldering; that dog’s persistent barking saved us, not to mention our building.

I left the city for the mountains years ago, and here, we expect our dogs to bark at visitors and delivery trucks; we need them to let me know when something’s wrong. And we’re thrilled at their barking when we come home.

To mutilate a pet for our simple convenience is unconscionable and barbaric. We should know enough about how our pets and neighbors are likely to behave to judge whether having a pet in our present situation is a good idea or not.

If not, we should have the sense to defer pet ownership or move to more hospitable surroundings.
1046 2010-02-04 While Apple continues to gain market share in many products, Microsoft has lost share in Web browsers, high-end laptops and smartphones. Despite billions in investment, its Xbox line is still at best an equal contender in the game console business. It first ignored and then stumbled in personal music players until that business was locked up by Apple.

Microsoft’s huge profits — $6.7 billion for the past quarter — come almost entirely from Windows and Office programs first developed decades ago. Like G.M. with its trucks and S.U.V.’s, Microsoft can’t count on these venerable products to sustain it forever. Perhaps worst of all, Microsoft is no longer considered the cool or cutting-edge place to work. There has been a steady exit of its best and brightest.

What happened? Unlike other companies, Microsoft never developed a true system for innovation. Some of my former colleagues argue that it actually developed a system to thwart innovation. Despite having one of the largest and best corporate laboratories in the world, and the luxury of not one but three chief technology officers, the company routinely manages to frustrate the efforts of its visionary thinkers.

For example, early in my tenure, our group of very clever graphics experts invented a way to display text on screen called ClearType. It worked by using the color dots of liquid crystal displays to make type much more readable on the screen. Although we built it to help sell e-books, it gave Microsoft a huge potential advantage for every device with a screen. But it also annoyed other Microsoft groups that felt threatened by our success.

Engineers in the Windows group falsely claimed it made the display go haywire when certain colors were used. The head of Office products said it was fuzzy and gave him headaches. The vice president for pocket devices was blunter: he’d support ClearType and use it, but only if I transferred the program and the programmers to his control. As a result, even though it received much public praise, internal promotion and patents, a decade passed before a fully operational version of ClearType finally made it into Windows.

Another example: When we were building the tablet PC in 2001, the vice president in charge of Office at the time decided he didn’t like the concept. The tablet required a stylus, and he much preferred keyboards to pens and thought our efforts doomed. To guarantee they were, he refused to modify the popular Office applications to work properly with the tablet. So if you wanted to enter a number into a spreadsheet or correct a word in an e-mail message, you had to write it in a special pop-up box, which then transferred the information to Office. Annoying, clumsy and slow.

So once again, even though our tablet had the enthusiastic support of top management and had cost hundreds of millions to develop, it was essentially allowed to be sabotaged. To this day, you still can’t use Office directly on a Tablet PC. And despite the certainty that an Apple tablet was coming this year, the tablet group at Microsoft was eliminated.

Not everything that has gone wrong at Microsoft is due to internecine warfare. Part of the problem is a historic preference to develop (highly profitable) software without undertaking (highly risky) hardware. This made economic sense when the company was founded in 1975, but now makes it far more difficult to create tightly integrated, beautifully designed products like an iPhone or TiVo. And, yes, part of the problem has been an understandable caution in the wake of the antitrust settlement. Timing has also been poor — too soon on Web TV, too late on iPods.

Internal competition is common at great companies. It can be wisely encouraged to force ideas to compete. The problem comes when the competition becomes uncontrolled and destructive. At Microsoft, it has created a dysfunctional corporate culture in which the big established groups are allowed to prey upon emerging teams, belittle their efforts, compete unfairly against them for resources, and over time hector them out of existence. It’s not an accident that almost all the executives in charge of Microsoft’s music, e-books, phone, online, search and tablet efforts over the past decade have left.

As a result, while the company has had a truly amazing past and an enviably prosperous present, unless it regains its creative spark, it’s an open question whether it has much of a future.
1047 2010-02-04 Donna Wilson, a British designer, has given Staffordshire ceramic dogs — popular in the 19th century, and still collectible today — a contemporary face-lift. Working with traditional forms from a factory in Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire, she paints a patterned Fair Isle-style sweater on each dog by hand. Her objective is to bring an old design back to life, she said, “but with my own kind of handwriting.” The dogs, above, which come in pairs (for about $400), can be bought through the Future Perfect — as can some of Ms. Wilson’s latest textile designs, which are on display until Feb. 26 at the Future Perfect Manhattan, as part of “Friendly + Fresh,” a show of furniture and accessories from SCP, a British company. Her contributions include Treecloud knitted lamb’s-wool poufs ($393 to $723), Nos Da wool throws ($295 each) and the Wilma bench ($875). Information: (877) 388-7373 or thefutureperfect.com.
1048 2010-02-04 “I take some fault for this,” Mr. Obama said at a meeting with Senate Democrats. “At the end of the process, when we were fighting through all these filibusters and trying to get it done quickly — so that we could pivot and start talking about other issues that were so important to the American people — some of that transparency got lost. And I think we paid a price for it.”

The chairman of the committee, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said he was “very confident” that Congress would soon pass a comprehensive health bill, even though the legislation was now stalled.

“We are on the brink of accomplishing real health care reform,” Mr. Baucus said. “I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol, not to give up.”

Mr. Obama’s budget assumes approval of the legislation. But he and Congressional Democratic leaders have not said how they intend to achieve that goal, in the face of continued opposition from Republicans who say the government cannot afford its existing health care commitments.

Jobs and the economy have replaced health care as Mr. Obama’s top priority, but Ms. Sebelius said passage of the health bill would help create jobs and save them.

The hearing came as the government issued a report estimating that national health spending totaled $2.5 trillion last year, or 17.3 percent of the economy. The health share of the gross domestic product increased 1.1 percentage points from 2008, the largest one-year increase since the government started keeping track of such data in 1960.

A major factor in the growth of health spending was the increase in Medicaid enrollment and Medicaid spending as a result of rising unemployment. As people lost jobs, they lost private insurance, and many turned to Medicaid.

Also contributing to the increase, federal officials said, was the fact that many people sought treatment for the H1N1 flu virus.

The federal report, published on the Web site of the journal Health Affairs, estimates that health spending will climb to $4.5 trillion, or nearly one-fifth of the economy, by 2019.

Christopher J. Truffer, an actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the main author of the report, predicted that public spending for doctors’ services, hospital care and prescription drugs would grow faster than private spending in the coming decade.

As a result, Mr. Truffer said, the public share of total health spending — 47 percent in 2008 — is expected to exceed 50 percent by 2012 and then reach 52 percent by 2019.

In the report, Mr. Truffer said, “we do not consider how any health care reform legislation might change the projections.”

The Congressional Budget Office has said the health bills passed by the House and the Senate could reduce federal deficits in the next 10 years. But Richard S. Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, has said the legislation could also speed the growth of overall health spending, increasing the 10-year total by $220 billion to $290 billion.

The new report predicts that, under current law, health spending will grow in the next decade at an average annual rate of 6.1 percent, which is 1.7 percentage points faster than the economy as a whole.
1049 2010-02-04 LOS ANGELES — A New Age motivational speaker who led a sweat lodge ceremony in Arizona last year in which three people died was indicted Wednesday on manslaughter charges despite his claims he did nothing wrong.

James A. Ray, president of James Ray International, a multimillion-dollar company in Carlsbad, Calif., that promises followers a path to “harmonic wealth in all areas of your life,” was arrested at a law office in Prescott, Ariz., not far from the Sedona retreat where the fatal Oct. 8 ceremony was held. He was jailed in lieu of $5 million bond, said a statement by Sheriff Steve Waugh of Yavapai County.

Sheriff Waugh said he “hopes the families of the three victims will now have some measure of closure to this tragedy.” He declined to be interviewed.

The victims, Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, N.Y.; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minn., were overcome in the two-hour “spiritual warrior” ceremony, in which hot rocks were placed inside a tent so the 55 participants could sweat out whatever was ailing their souls. Twenty others suffered heat-related injuries.

Participants have said Mr. Ray ignored signs that people were falling into distress in the pitch-dark tent and said things like “it’s a good day to die” in his zeal to keep the ceremony going. Several lawsuits have alleged negligence and fraud.
1050 2010-02-04 On Wednesday, that meant doing a little bit of everything. Levine and Cashman posed for photos, handed out Yankees T-shirts and hats, painted the eyes of a New Year’s dragon and fielded at least a few knowledgeable questions from bystanders. All this occurred as several girls danced on stage and the final moments of the Series clincher over Philadelphia played on two small screens.

“I was impressed by how much the native Chinese people knew about the Yankees and baseball; it was really great and impressive,” Levine said in a telephone interview afterward. “It was all the same questions that we get in New York.

“ ‘Why aren’t you bringing Matsui and Damon back?’ ” he said in reference to Hideki Matsui, the World Series most valuable player, and Johnny Damon, the veteran outfielder. “It was truly a neat experience to be on the other side of the world and hearing the same questions.”

Cashman said in a separate telephone interview, “There was a lot of confetti, a lot of smoke.”

M.L.B.’s goal is to build a base in China like the N.B.A.’s. It broadcasts games to more than 50 Chinese television stations and reaps tens of millions of dollars in revenue from Chinese fans. But baseball has a long way to go: four million people play baseball in China, according to Xinhua, the state news agency, and the country has a relatively meager professional league. By comparison, China has a nationwide basketball league, and 300 million Chinese are said to play the sport regularly.

Moreover, major league teams do not have the equivalent of Yao Ming, the Houston basketball star, to attract Chinese fans. Five Chinese players have been signed by major league clubs since 2001, to little fanfare.

And so efforts to build the sport remain a “one-step-at-a-time approach,” said Leon Xie, the managing director of MLB China.

Baseball has made serious efforts to stir interest since 2003, when the former major leaguers Jim Lefebvre and Bruce Hurst were sent as coaches to China’s national team. M.L.B. has since spent millions of dollars on developing the sport in China.

Play Ball, a program focused on young players and coordinated with the Ministry of Education, organizes tournaments for 120 schools in five cities. In addition, a player-development center opened last fall in the southern city of Wuxi.

Ultimately, however, baseball’s true emergence in China may need the jolt provided by a superstar who makes a big impact in the major leagues.

“Baseball’s Yao Ming is 11, 12 years old,” Xie said. “He exists somewhere in this country. Our mission is to spend the next 10, 15 years finding that kid.”

Levine said: “The dream of kids all over the world is to play in Yankee Stadium. One day that will be a Chinese kid’s dream.”

Based on the questions Levine received at the event, some may already be dreaming. However, others in attendance were more tentative.

“I usually watch Ping-Pong,” said Xu Dacheng, 25, who had been waiting for a friend at the mall when he happened on the event. “I don’t know the details of the game. Just that you hit a ball with a bat.”

Liang Xiao, 27, a self-professed sports nut who has watched a few baseball games online, said: “I seriously had no idea what was going on. I’d love to play, even there are no opportunities in China and I am a little fat.”

Jiang Xiao, 24, said he and every baseball fan he knows were introduced to the game through a popular series of Japanese comics.

Even so, he said warily, he was not overly interested in playing himself .

“That ball is so tiny,” Jiang said, “and the bat is so thin. It looks very difficult.”
1051 2010-02-04 SÃO PAULO, Brazil — President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina formally dismissed the president of Argentina’s central bank on Wednesday and vowed to follow through with her plan to tap $6.59 billion of the country’s reserves to pay down foreign debt, a demand that the bank president had refused to heed.

Mrs. Kirchner announced in a news conference that Mercedes Marcó del Pont, 50, would replace the central bank’s president, Martín Redrado. Mrs. Kirchner also vowed to keep pushing to use bank reserves to help pay $13 billion of Argentina’s foreign debt that is due this year. “It makes sense to pay the debt with reserves,” she said, contending that doing so would help lower interest rates and help Argentina to tap global finance markets again.

The move is the latest in a continuing struggle among Mrs. Kirchner’s government, the central bank and Argentina’s courts over her decision in January to tap a part of the bank’s $48 billion in reserves by presidential decree. When Mr. Redrado refused, citing the bank’s autonomy, she fired him, only to have a federal judge rule days later that she could not take either action without congressional approval.

After being barred by the police from returning to his office at the bank, Mr. Redrado resigned on Friday. But the Kirchner government said it would not accept his resignation without hearing from a three-member congressional committee. The committee delivered its recommendation to Mrs. Kirchner on Tuesday, but it did not comment publicly.

On Wednesday, Mrs. Kirchner finally replaced Mr. Redrado with Ms. Marcó del Pont. She was previously the president of the state-owned Banco de la Nación Argentina and served as a congresswoman as a member of Mrs. Kirchner’s Front for Victory Party from 2003 to 2007. Mrs. Kirchner said that while in Congress, Ms. Marcó del Pont had proposed a bill that sought to redefine the role of the central bank so that it would work more closely with the government on enacting economic policy.

Argentina’s Congress is expected to take up the question of tapping the reserves to pay down debt when it reconvenes in March after a summer recess.
1052 2010-02-04 Voice-mail boxes inside Goldman Sachs lit up on Jan. 21 with an unusual message from the bank’s chief executive  a bit of Wall Street speak that sounded like the makings of a book on Zen and the Art of Money-Making.

“In a year that proved to have no shortage of story lines, I believe very strongly that performance is the ultimate narrative,” the chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said in the companywide message. He then celebrated the bank’s record profits in 2009 and discussed its plans to pay bonuses to its employees.

Left unanswered now, as then, is the question that all of Wall Street has been chewing on for months: How much will Mr. Blankfein be paid for his remarkable  and controversial  success in running Goldman?

Anxious executives at rival banks are awaiting the news with a mixture of envy and alarm. Guesses range from nothing to $100 million. Whatever the final figure is  high, low, or somewhere in between  it will set a new benchmark for pay throughout the industry. Goldman Sachs insisted on Wednesday that no decision had been made.

Goldman employees offered various interpretations of Mr. Blankfein’s voice-mail message, one of dozens that he has left since becoming chief in 2006. Many agreed on one point, however: The message was somehow linked to the uproar in Washington and elsewhere across the country over resurgent profits and pay at big banks like Goldman.

Some heard in the message a call to keep quiet about the many billions of dollars in bonuses that Goldman is paying. Others said Mr. Blankfein seemed to be suggesting that Goldman employees, rather than policy makers or the news media, would write their success story by doing what Goldman does best: make money.

Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman, said everybody got the message, which was that “performance speaks for itself.”

Many other big banks disclosed the compensation of their top executives in recent weeks, and Goldman was widely expected to do the same by now. The delay has spawned a number of reports about what Goldman will do. The Times of London, for instance, reported this week that Mr. Blankfein might receive a mind-boggling $100 million, a figure that would eclipse his previous record of $68 million in 2007. He took no bonus in 2008.

“There is speculation, and then there is stupidity,” Mr. van Praag said. “This speculation transcends the simply stupid and takes it to an entirely new level.”

Even so, Goldman is undoubtedly making some careful political and business calculations. The bank also may be biding its time and waiting for an opportune public relations moment to break the news.

Nearly everyone on Wall Street focuses on the Number, the annual bonus that makes up the vast majority of compensation for bankers and traders. But this year, Mr. Blankfein must also consider what one public relations specialist called the Gag Number  how much he can be paid without unleashing another round of bonus-bashing in Washington.

That limit is uncertain. What is sure is that the politics of pay are as heated as ever. Two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer of California, and Jim Webb of Virginia, plan to propose legislation on Thursday that would tax bonuses for top executives at companies that received billions of bailout dollars during the financial crisis. Like most big banks, Goldman paid back the money, with interest.

Who decides Mr. Blankfein’s pay? The answer may come as a bit of a surprise. Goldman’s compensation committee comprises 10 outsiders. Among them are Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Brown University; the billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi N. Mittal; and James A. Johnson, the Washington insider and former chief executive of Fannie Mae, who was forced to resign as head of the vice presidential vetting committee for Barack Obama in response to a variety of accusations about corporate missteps. None of those three could be reached for comment on Wednesday.

Whatever the size of Mr. Blankfein’s bonus, it will come in the form of long-term stock, rather than cash. Goldman, in a nod to public opinion, has already announced that he and 29 senior executives would forgo cash payments.

Once the compensation committee decides how much stock Mr. Blankfein and those executives should receive and at what price, and the stock is awarded, Goldman has 48 hours to file a Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Over the last week or so, people up and down Wall Street have been keenly watching the S.E.C. Web site for Mr. Blankfein’s filing.

Goldman, meanwhile, has quietly told its thousands of other employees what they might expect for their bonuses. Other Wall Street chiefs have revealed their paydays. Morgan Stanley, for instance, recently announced that its new chief executive, James P. Gorman, was getting about $11 million or $12 million. But others, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, who is expected to be paid $15 million to $20 million, appear to be waiting for Mr. Blankfein’s announcement  and the reaction to it  before announcing their own bonuses.
1053 2010-02-04 Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, said fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates on costs from its acquisition of Wyeth and projected lower-than-expected earnings in 2010.

Profit in the period more than doubled to $767 million, or 10 cents a share, from $266 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier, when results were hurt by a $2.3 billion legal settlement related to the marketing of the Bextra painkiller. Earnings excluding one-time items were 49 cents a share, falling 2 cents short of the average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.

Pfizer forecast 2010 profit excluding certain items of $2.10 to $2.20, also below Wall Street estimates.

Pfizer completed its $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in October to help replace the billions in revenue that will be lost when its top-selling cholesterol pill, Lipitor, faces generic competition next year. Pfizer is cutting costs by laying off about 19,000 workers and closing manufacturing plants and six research centers.

“Over all, it is a bit of a disappointment at the initial look,” said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swaan & Company.
1054 2010-02-04 Here’s why Apple may have created the ultimate plaything:

¶Young children think with their fingers. If they see something, they jab at it. If iPad delivers as promised, it will have evaporated the abstract link between a child’s hand and the more abstract screen images, so no game controller or mouse is needed. The screen is the controller and it sits in their lap, which works for children (and their grandparents, too, by the way).

¶There’s a good supply of affordable software. We all know that hardware is only as good as its software, and iPad’s existing 140,000 titles include some tried-and-true children’s options.

¶It’s a new outlet for storytellers. Anyone over 18 has fond memories of The Living Books. These interactive experiences cleverly wove stories from Mercer Mayer or Dr. Seuss with hidden surprises. The iPad’s clear, page-sized screen could breathe new life into this genre, now that fingers are back in style.

Even though Apple didn’t intend to make a toy, I believe it just did. We’ll have to see how the screen holds up to peanut butter.
1055 2010-02-04 Olympus has announced a new version of its slick-looking PEN Micro Four Thirds camera that is aimed at everyday users with intuitive features and a lower price. The new PEN E-PL1, priced at $600, will include a built-in flash, faster autofocus and graphical interface that will enable casual photographers to easily achieve more sophisticated results.

The E-PL1 is a follow-up to last year’s E-P1 and E-P2 models, which were beautifully engineered but suffered from flaws, including a lack of a built-in flash, slow autofocus and a price tag that started at $800.

The new model is a bit blockier than its predecessors and lacks some of the original panache, but it has the same large image sensor, interchangeable lens capabilities and high-definition 720p video. And it’s still considerably more compact than a digital single-lens reflex camera.

The E-PL1, compatible with Micro Four Thirds lenses, will be sold in a kit with a 14mm to 42mm (28mm to 84mm equivalent) f3.5/5.6 zoom lens.

Other differences between the E-PL1 and the previous models include a smaller LCD (2.7 inches vs. 3 inches) and a mono mic.

The new PEN E-PL1 will be available in mid-March in black, Champagne gold and slate blue. RIK FAIRLIE
1056 2010-02-04 He added that the history of Congressional regulation of corporate involvement in politics had a dark side, pointing to the Tillman Act, which banned corporate contributions to federal candidates in 1907.

“Go back and read why Tillman introduced that legislation,” Justice Thomas said, referring to Senator Benjamin Tillman. “Tillman was from South Carolina, and as I hear the story he was concerned that the corporations, Republican corporations, were favorable toward blacks and he felt that there was a need to regulate them.”

It is thus a mistake, the justice said, to applaud the regulation of corporate speech as “some sort of beatific action.”

Justice Thomas said the First Amendment’s protections applied regardless of how people chose to assemble to participate in the political process.

“If 10 of you got together and decided to speak, just as a group, you’d say you have First Amendment rights to speak and the First Amendment right of association,” he said. “If you all then formed a partnership to speak, you’d say we still have that First Amendment right to speak and of association.”

“But what if you put yourself in a corporate form?” Justice Thomas asked, suggesting that the answer must be the same.

Asked about his attitude toward the two decisions overruled in Citizens United, he said, “If it’s wrong, the ultimate precedent is the Constitution.”

Justice Thomas would not directly address the controversy over Mr. Obama’s criticism of the Citizens United ruling or Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.’s mouthed “not true” in response. But he did say he had stopped attending the addresses.

“I don’t go because it has become so partisan and it’s very uncomfortable for a judge to sit there,” he said, adding that “there’s a lot that you don’t hear on TV — the catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments.”

“One of the consequences,” he added in an apparent reference to last week’s address, “is now the court becomes part of the conversation, if you want to call it that, in the speeches. It’s just an example of why I don’t go.”
1057 2010-02-04 Q. You told the president that you couldn’t get a loan. What happened?

A. What started the big capital push is we didn’t have the money to fill orders from Home Depot. So I called the S.B.A. in Miami, which sent me to all these microlenders in Florida. But they turned us down; they said they didn’t have enough funding.

Q. Did you try to get an S.B.A. 7(a) working capital loan?

A. I met with SunTrust and Bank of America — Bank of America was my bank — and they told me that I would not qualify because my credit score was not high enough. I came out of the building industry, and I lost my company during the real estate crash in 2006. I was right in the middle of a beautiful, $35 million town home project when the meltdown occurred. So when I lost all that money, it put me in a capital vacuum, and my credit score suffered.

But it wasn’t just the credit score — they needed hard assets on the floor. They either needed equipment or they needed to secure it against inventory. All of our stuff is hand-assembled; the equipment we have is probably worth $50,000. But I need $250,000, and they said, "No, you’re not going to be able to get $250,000 with $50,000 of assets."

A. If you look at our sales versus our costs, yes, we’re profitable. But most of that goes to overhead and other costs because the volume is low.

Q. Are you paying bills on time?

Q. The president said that one cause of the recession is that banks took on too much risk when they made commercial loans. Why should a bank — or the government, for that matter — make a loan to someone who has poor credit and no assets?

A. Well, first of all, I’m not a bad credit risk. What happened to me happened to every developer and every builder and every single person related to the real estate industry nationwide. Every single one of us — millions of people — had their credit trashed because of this crash.

But the government should take that risk because I’m a much better risk than A.I.G. I’m a much better risk than a lot of the things they’ve invested in because I can produce results now. They loan me the money, I can create jobs now.

Q. How much do you want, and what would you do with it?

A. I need between $250,000 and $500,000. About $50,000 of this money would go to filing patents in foreign countries. We have customers waiting in the Middle East but I don’t have the money to file our patents, so we can’t sell to them.

The second thing is, we need to be a direct television product. Instant-Off is a very visual product, and we’re just about ready to finish our first commercial. We need money, between $50,000 and $100,000, to advertise Instant-Off in 15 to 20 markets, five times a day. I’ve already met with the people at Wal-Mart. They love our product. They said, "It works right within our sustainability program, and we want to start carrying more products made in the U.S. But unless you advertise on TV, no one’s going to know about your product."

Q. What did you think of the president’s answer to your question?

A. [Sighs deeply.] I think he answered the best he could based on what he knows to be true. His knowledge of what is happening and what my personal experience is are different. I’ve met with the S.B.A. people, and I know how competent they are. And he says they don’t have enough people to make loans directly. I appreciate the fact that he’s earmarking $30 billion for small business, but it’s not enough. How much of that is going to be loaned out? I know he really cares, and I know he’s extremely smart. But he doesn’t have the insight like I have. I’m in it, living it every day, and I’m struggling. And if he spent 20 or 30 minutes talking to me, he’d come away with the specifics he’s missing.

Q. Did you give your information to the president’s “body man,” Reggie Love, like he asked?

A. I started walking down toward the podium, and a very serious woman in a trench coat — a Secret Service lady — came up to me and said, [affecting a low voice] “Are you Steve Gordon?” Normally I would completely deny knowing that guy —

Q. Well, sure, given your history —

A. [Laughs.] Right. But I said, “sure,” and she said, “I need all your company information.” And she talked into her sleeve and said, “I found him.”

Q. What’s been the reaction from banks since you asked the question?

A. It’s been really good. I have a bank meeting this afternoon, from a bank that called me and said they want to help. And then I talked to someone yesterday who said he’s on the board of directors of a community bank, and I’ve got a meeting with them on Friday. I got another call from an investment banker who wants to meet me Thursday. So I did get three calls from banks.

And I had 15 or 20 calls from across the country from businessmen that called just out of the blue to thank me for asking the question.
1058 2010-02-04 Taxes have dominated the political discussion in Germany since Mrs. Merkel won re-election in September. The global economic recession has left Germany with a record federal budget deficit of $120 billion and every day there are new headlines in the newspapers here about municipalities deep in the red.

Germany has a pronounced problem with tax evasion because the country has high tax rates for top earners but is geographically close to tax havens like Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Broader concerns about corporate corruption and the government’s inability to rein in unreported income, known here as “Schwarzarbeit,” have fed the impression that the government has lost control of its finances.

The warning to tax evaders by the finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, added a new dimension to the current case, because tax cheats have no way of knowing whether their names are on the list. “I can only advise anyone who thinks they might have evaded taxes in the past to avail themselves of the offer in our tax code to make a voluntary declaration,” Mr. Schäuble told the newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine in an interview published Wednesday.

With the threat of jail sentences looming over them, many with secret Swiss bank accounts might confess, not knowing whether their accounts are still secret.

The case is similar to one in 2008, where the government purchased data on funds stashed away in Liechtenstein for up to $7 million. That information resulted in the high-profile arrest of the chief executive of Deutsche Post, Klaus Zumwinkel, who was then forced to resign from the German postal service.

Then as now, a debate broke out over the ethics of buying stolen information as a means of cracking down on tax evasion, not to mention whether it could be used as evidence. Mr. Schäuble pointed to nearly 200 cases prosecuted using data from the Liechtenstein purchase, without a single court refusing to hear the evidence.

But Volker Kauder, parliamentary leader for Mr. Schäuble and Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, took the opposite line Monday, telling reporters, “Theft remains theft. The state should not put itself on the same level as thieves.” He backed away from his strongest comments Wednesday, telling the newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger that “on the other hand I recognize that tax cheats have to be punished.”

His softened tone probably stemmed from the fact that Mrs. Merkel on Monday came out in favor of dealing with the informant. “If the data is relevant then it should be our goal to gain possession of the data,” Mrs. Merkel said.
1059 2010-02-04 The hybrid-electric Prius has long been Toyota’s “green car,” the symbol of the automaker’s engineering prowess and its big bet on the kind of car consumers will want to buy for decades to come.

But on Wednesday, the Prius was drawn into the mounting crisis for Toyota, as Japanese officials ordered the company to investigate problems with the brakes on the 2010 model. American safety officials also said they had received dozens of similar complaints.

The problems seemed to weigh on the company's stock as markets opened in Asia Thursday morning, with Toyota down nearly 5 percent in early trading in Tokyo.

The new questions surrounding the Prius raise doubts about a different problem in a model that was not part of the recent global recalls of more than nine million vehicles.

“Prius is the gold standard,” said Brian Johnson, the senior global auto industry analyst with Barclays Capital in Chicago.

“We know Toyota puts its best engineering and its best talent into that car,” added Mr. Johnson, a Prius owner whose wife and mother-in-law also drive Priuses. “This hits at its flagship.”

Adding to its woes, the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said Wednesday that owners of recalled Toyotas should stop driving their vehicles, though he quickly backtracked on the comments.

More questions are being raised about other models as well.

On Wednesday, Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, asked the president of Toyota’s North American operations, Yoshimi Inaba, for more information about the small Tacoma pickup.

Mr. Inaba is scheduled to testify next week before the committee, which will hold the first of two Congressional hearings on the Toyota recalls.

The Tacoma, built in the United States, was involved in a recall for problems with floor mats but was not included in the second recall, over sticking accelerator pedals. Even so, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received more than 170 complaints about unintended acceleration on 2006-10 Tacoma trucks. Mr. Towns, in a letter, asked why the Tacoma had not been included in the second recall.

The reason, Toyota said Wednesday, is that Denso, a Japanese supplier, makes the Tacoma’s pedals, and they are not part of the sticking-pedal recall. The recalled models have pedals from an American supplier.

“Even if five years from now this is all a statistic fluke for Toyota, while the narrative plays out, you will see consumer anxiety,” said Mr. Johnson, the Barclays analyst.

Toyota has sold 1.2 million Priuses worldwide since 1997, about half in the United States. Last year, it was Toyota’s third-best-selling American car, behind the Camry and the Corolla.

Earlier Prius models were involved in the recalls, in which buyers were advised to remove floor mats so they would not block accelerator pedals.

But the 2010 model avoided that recall, and no Prius models have been part of Toyota’s recall for sticking pedals. Like the Tacoma, they are equipped with pedals from the Japanese supplier.

Toyota received thousands of advance orders for the new Prius went it went on sale in Japan last May. Federal safety officials there received their first complaint about brakes on the car two months later.

The company said Thursday that it had received 77 reports of braking problems related to the newest Prius model.

At least 14 cases have been reported to the government, Japan’s Transport Ministry said, with drivers complaining of brakes momentarily failing at low speeds, especially on slippery surfaces. The ministry said that its request to Toyota to investigate the Prius brakes was routine.

In addition, in the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported at least 136 complaints involving the brakes on the 2010 Prius.

Four of the American cases involved a crash, and two of those resulted in injuries, according to the agency’s database.

Many of the complaints are from drivers who say their vehicles surged forward or temporarily lost braking after driving over a pothole or another uneven surface. Many say it is a recurring problem.

There are almost no similar complaints about braking for earlier models of the Prius, including the 2004-9 versions that were included in the floor mat recall, although the safety agency has held two other defect investigations on the Prius, over stalled engines and headlights.
1060 2010-02-04 PARIS — In what seemed intended as a display of technological advance, Iran said on Wednesday that it had fired a rocket into space carrying living organisms — a rat, two turtles and worms, according to the state-run Press TV.

The test involved a rocket described as the Kavoshgar-3, which is capable of carrying satellites. Iran’s missile program has prompted worries among Western analysts that it is working on a weapons delivery system with broad regional consequences. In December, Iran said it test-fired an improved version of its most advanced missile, the Sejil-2, capable of reaching Israel and parts of Europe.

The Wednesday launching came a day after the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, suggested that his country would support an agreement to export low-enriched nuclear fuel, a deal put forth by the United States and other Western countries that seeks to head off a crisis over Iran’s nuclear program.

Mr. Ahmadinejad’s comments, which were reported by Press TV, appeared to contradict Iran’s rejection of the deal a few weeks ago, extending a series of ever-shifting public statements by Iran on the proposal. Diplomatic officials greeted Mr. Ahmadinejad’s remarks with skepticism.

Earlier, officials in Washington said the Obama administration was accelerating the deployment of new defenses against possible Iranian missile attacks in the Persian Gulf, placing special ships off the Iranian coast and antimissile systems in at least four Arab countries.
1061 2010-02-04 But the runners’ forms were not affected by the extra weight, Dr. Tanaka said. That means that you would probably run the same way if you were heavier. But it would be a lot harder to run at your usual pace, and you’d end up running more slowly.

How much is less clear. Beth Parker, the director of exercise physiology research at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, said that, for runners, the general rule is that a 1 percent reduction in weight leads to a 1 percent increase in performance.

So, why not just be as thin as you can be?

The problem is that everyone has a point at which further weight loss actually makes their performance worse, said Dr. Mark Tarnopolsky, a muscle metabolism researcher and physiologist at McMaster University in Ontario. Dr. Tarnopolsky, who is a nationally ranked athlete in winter triathlons, adventure racing and ski orienteering, said that people vary so much that there is no formula to figure out the perfect weight.

When Dr. Tarnopolsky was in graduate school, he saw the delicate balance between losing just enough and too much. He and his friends would experiment, losing or gaining a few pounds and testing their VO2 maxes, a measure of the body’s ability to get oxygen to muscles during exercise. In theory, the less you weigh, the higher your VO2 max should be, relative to body weight.

Dr. Tarnopolsky said that he got his best VO2 max — 86 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight — when he weighed 156 pounds. “Like everyone else, I said, ‘Maybe if I drop some body fat, it will go higher,’ ” Dr. Tarnopolsky said. So he got his weight down to 152 pounds. But to his surprise, his VO2 max decreased, to 82.

The likely reason, he said, was that he had reached a point where his body began burning its own muscle protein for fuel. He was weaker, and his performance was worse, even though he weighed less.

“You could see on the VO2 machine what your body knew was right,” Dr. Tarnopolsky said. “You’d feel tired, stale, lethargic when you tried to drive your weight down.”

Often the only way to know your best weight is by trial and error.

My running coach, Tom Fleming, a former elite runner who won the New York City Marathon twice, in 1973 and 1975, said that he always tells his competitive athletes “that the perfect weight is the weight you are the day you P.B. in your event,” referring to the time you achieve your personal best — or fastest — finish.

“Your body will tell you” your perfect weight, he said, and when you are there, “you will feel fast, race fast.”

Dathan Ritzenhein, an American who is one of the world’s top runners, used a similar system. Mr. Ritzenhein, who broke the national record last year in a 5,000-meter-race and who, at ninth place, was the top American finisher in the marathon at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, said that it took him about 12 years of trial and error to learn his best racing weight. He discovered it last year, his best racing year ever: 121 or 122 pounds (he is 5 feet 8).

That weight is not a natural one for him, he said. If he were to stop training, he would weight about 127 or 128 pounds, and when he is training but not trying to control his weight, he is about 124 or 125. His goal is to try to be at his perfect racing weight a couple of weeks before a big event, losing about a pound a week in the preceding weeks to get there.

He has learned, he said, that if he tries to lose weight too fast or if he continues to lose weight up until his race day, he does not have the energy he needs for his best performance. And if he tries to lose weight too fast, his training suffers.

“It’s a hard line” between losing just enough at the right rate and losing too much too fast, he said.

Other athletes say that they learned through similar experiments.

Andre Agassi, the tennis star, and his longtime trainer, Gil Reyes, discovered through experience that Mr. Agassi’s best weight was between 178 and 182 pounds (Mr. Agassi is 5 feet 11 1/2.)

“We came up with a number, but we did not seek a number,” Mr. Reyes explained in a recent telephone interview. “It was all about him feeling strong and fit.”

Tennis is different from distance running, Mr. Reyes noted. Athletes like Mr. Agassi never know if they will be playing for one or five hours, and they have to be ready for every possibility.

Before he retired from tennis, Mr. Agassi would sometimes gain weight and then stop eating, trying to shed the pounds fast. Mr. Reyes discouraged this. “I said to him, ‘Why do you feel like you have to stop eating to lose that weight?,’ ” he recalled. “ ‘What if you were to eat 10 to 15 percent more, but train 40 percent more?’ ”

Bicyclists in grueling races like the Tour de France also have the problem of maintaining their strength, but for them a little extra weight can make the difference between winning and performing dismally on days when the race has steep hills or mountains.

“I knew from experience and results that I had an ideal weight — or what I thought was ideal,” said Andy Hampsten, a former Tour de France rider and the only American ever to win the Giro D’Italia, in 1988. “If I set too low of a weight goal, I would be weak and stressed,” he said. “If I weighed 4 or 5 pounds more than ideal, I could see I was slower than my competitors.”

Mr. Hampsten, who is 5 feet 9, said that he aimed for a race weight of about 137 pounds, deliberately reducing his intake in the two months before racing season. In the off season he would let his weight drift up to a more comfortable 145 pounds.

The lesson is that, even if the laws of physics and an experience on an AlterG may seem to prove the benefits of a lower weight, exercise science is nowhere near making good predictions for specific athletes, Dr. Tarnopolsky said.

“I know an individual who is one of the fittest ultra-sport athletes,” he said. “She competes in 100 milers, and her body fat is close to 20 percent.”

Yet, he said, “she is one of the most talented athletes I have ever seen.”

Mr. Reyes said that he and Mr. Agassi learned not to let the scale rule your life. “We had a little bit of a phrase,” he said. “The weight scale to most human beings can be like a Ouija board. It can start messing with your head.”

The trick is not to let it.

1081 2010-02-05 LOS ANGELES — Dustin Johnson, generally regarded as the best athlete and one of the longest hitters on the PGA Tour, showed his mastery of the total game on Thursday. On a relatively calm day at Riviera Country Club, the 25-year-old Johnson used superior iron play and a deft putting touch to shoot a bogeyless seven-under-par 64 and grab the first-round lead in the Northern Trust Open.

After starting on the 10th hole and going out in 32, Johnson set up the last two of his seven birdies by hitting 3-iron tee shots and 9-iron approaches on the par-4 seventh and eighth holes.

“I got off to a good start, had good vibes going all day, and just hit the ball really good all day long,” said Johnson, who needed only 25 putts — including a 65-footer for birdie at the 12th hole.

Johnson posted his score early in the day, and no one could match it. He finished with a one-stroke lead over Andrés Romero and Kevin Stadler, who both shot 65, and two strokes over Ricky Barnes and Brandt Snedeker.

The 19-year-old Japanese sensation Ryo Ishikawa was five under par after 14 holes, but bogeyed two holes coming in and finished with a three-under 68, tied for 10th.

Two of the pretournament favorites, the defending champion Phil Mickelson and the 2001 winner Robert Allenby, each had trouble with the docile golf course and shot rounds of one-over-par 72. Mickelson, whose average approach shot ended 34 feet from the hole, lipped out his 8-footer for par at the final hole. He hit only 7 of 14 fairways and 11 of 18 greens.
1082 2010-02-05 Air Products and Chemicals, a producer of industrial gases, has made an unsolicited $5.1 billion offer for a rival, Airgas, after having been rebuffed for months, people briefed on the matter said Thursday.

If Air Products’ latest offer is rejected, the company is prepared to wage a hostile bid, including by staging a proxy fight, the people briefed on the matter said.

The offer, worth about $60 a share, is expected to be made public Friday morning, these people said. It represents a 38 percent premium to Airgas’s closing share price of $43.53 on Thursday and an 18 percent premium over its 52-week high of $51. Including debt, the Air Products’ offer is valued at about $7 billion.

As the stock and credit markets recover, deal makers expect an upswing in merger activity and in hostile offers, as companies jump off the sidelines and pursue long-sought targets. One of the biggest deals so far this year, Kraft’s planned acquisition of Cadbury, began as an often-bitter struggle between the two companies, before they reached an agreement last month.

By making its offer now, Air Products is hoping to seize upon some current weakness in Airgas’s financial health. Last week, Airgas issued earnings guidance for its 2010 fiscal year that was below analyst expectations.
1083 2010-02-05 It could take two years or more to create new federal rules, the officials said, and it was not clear how far the government would go to restrict the movement of livestock between states if the animals did not meet basic traceability standards.

The system was created by the Bush administration in 2004 after the discovery in late 2003 of a cow infected with mad cow disease.

Participation of ranchers and farmers in the identification system was voluntary, but the goal was to give every animal, or in the case of pigs and poultry, groups of animals, a unique identification number that would be entered in a database. The movements of animals would be tracked, and if there was a disease outbreak or a sick animal was found, officials could quickly locate other animals that had been exposed.

But the system quickly drew the ire of many farmers and ranchers, particularly cattle producers. Some objected to the cost of identification equipment and the extra work in having to report their animals’ movements. Others said they believed the voluntary system would become mandatory, that it was intrusive and that the federal government would use it to pry into their lives and finances.

The old system received $142 million in federal financing, but gained the participation of only 40 percent of the nation’s livestock producers, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.

When Mr. Vilsack took over the Agriculture Department last year, he began a series of public meetings on the identification program and was bombarded by strident opposition.

Agriculture officials said that most details of a new system would be worked out in the coming months through consultation with the livestock industry and the states.

“It was just overwhelming in the country that people didn’t like it, and I think they took that feedback to heart,” said Mary Kay Thatcher, public policy director of the American Farm Bureau Federation, which had opposed the identification system. “I think it’s good they’ve at least said we’re going to do something different.”

Carol Tucker Foreman, a food safety expert of the Consumer Federation of America, agreed that the old system was not working and needed to be changed.

But she worried that a new system that could have different rules in every state might not be effective.

“It’s very, very hard to have an effective state-by-state program,” she said.
1084 2010-02-05 SEOUL — North Korea said Friday that it would release Robert Park, a Christian missionary from the United States who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to shut down its concentration camps, free all its prisoners and resign.

North Korean officials said they “decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” according to a report by the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A.

North Korea had remained silent about the fate of Mr. Park, 28, a Korean-American religious activist from Tucson who disappeared into the isolated nation after walking across a frozen river that makes up part of the border with China. Before his trip, he told friends in Seoul that he would die with political prisoners in the North if Mr. Kim refused to free them.

But Mr. Park confessed that he had been wrong about the North after meeting kind North Koreans, the K.C.N.A. report said.

“I seriously repent of the wrong I committed, taken in by the West’s false propaganda,” it quoted Mr. Park as saying in an interview. “What I have seen and heard in the North convinced me that I misunderstood it.”
1085 2010-02-05 Another expert agreed. “Pharma’s one that would really get hit,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “That’s a biggie.”

The industry giant Pfizer, for example, which has said that 88 percent of its $56 billion in income from 2004 through 2008 originated overseas, could be subject to the corporate 35 percent tax rate on at least some of its foreign profit in the future if the president’s proposal goes through.

Although the tax idea faced a cool reception from Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, it highlighted the risks to the drug industry of unpredictable election-year politics. It is a time when bolt-from-the-blue challenges may await drug makers, compared with the carefully mapped future they had worked out with the White House and the Senate under the health care legislation.

As if to reinforce the continuing business challenges that drug makers face, regardless of carrots and sticks from Washington, Pfizer issued an earnings report and financial forecast this week that disappointed Wall Street. The report, on Wednesday, has helped send its shares down 6.3 percent in the last two days.

Pfizer lowered its 2010 and 2012 forecasts, citing the rising dollar and the sale or spinoff of some assets, including animal health products and an H.I.V. drug. The company also noted the coming patent expirations on some of its blockbuster drugs, including Lipitor, as well as growing competition from lower-priced generics.

Several of the other big American drug companies reported a mixed bag of results last week. Johnson & Johnson posted a rare yearly decline in sales and gave a disappointing 2010 profit forecast. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates, helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Eli Lilly profit fell just short of expectations, and its shares declined as investors also showed concern about expirations of its drug patents.

The other big American drug maker, Merck, plans to report on Feb. 16.

None of those drug makers had forecast effects from a health care overhaul by Washington. But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill.

Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown’s victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was “largely consistent with the principles” that were important to his industry.

The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage.

And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal — including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada — would be tabled in return for drug makers’ support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table.

As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort.

It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama’s offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America’s Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals.

The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States.

Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years.

“Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,” he said. “There’s a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.”

Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers.

Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president’s new plan to tax “excessive” offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy.

“The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,” Professor Gordon said. “They’re not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts. It’s not working to their advantage.”

Some analysts, meanwhile, say parts of the $80 billion, 10-year deal could come back to bite the drug industry — if it is held to some of the cost pledges without receiving the offsetting political protection.

The pact, for instance, committed the industry to support an increase in the rebate the government receives on Medicaid drugs — to 23 percent, up from 15 percent currently.

In the current deficit-cutting environment, that discount may still look attractive to lawmakers. And it could conceivably be enacted by Congress at any time without being part of an industry quid pro quo. “No question that’s alive,” said Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical industry analyst for the health care investment bank Leerink Swann.

But the overall health care reform package, he added, is “either dead or severely hobbled.”
1086 2010-02-05 A binge of special interest money seems inevitable unless Congress acts quickly — before this year’s election — to repair the damage from the Supreme Court ruling that ended restraints on campaign spending by corporations and unions.

In its overreach, the court’s majority hobbled lawmakers by giving what amounted to constitutional sanction to unlimited corporate and union campaign contributions. But legitimate antidotes are already in the works. Congress should focus on the most feasible proposals. Some of these would:

¶Require detailed disclosure of exactly who is sponsoring and paying for attack ads and other “electioneering communications” that the court has now made possible right up to Election Day. Amorphous “Swift Boat” identities won’t do.

¶Empower shareholders and union members to review and approve the spending campaigns drawn up by their corporate chiefs or leaders.

¶Enact an airtight ban on foreign intrusion in federal elections. The court ruling could open the door to abuse by domestic subsidiaries of foreign corporations. Existing laws against foreign influence are porous and arguably useless in the hands of a Federal Election Commission deliberately hobbled by its Republican members.

¶Restrict campaign spending to the extent possible by companies that contract extensively with the federal government. Why not extend the same legal precedent that restricts Amtrak’s corporate campaigning to banks and companies bailed out by the taxpayers?

These and other proposals are being shaped by Representative Chris Van Hollen and Senator Charles Schumer. They are wisely focusing on what is immediately feasible, not trying to amend the Constitution.
1087 2010-02-05 MasterCard posted a 23 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, but the results fell short of analysts’ estimates and the company lowered its long-term forecast, contributing to a 10 percent decline in its share price.

MasterCard said it earned $294 million, or $2.24 a share, in the period, up from $239.4 million, or $1.84 a share, a year earlier. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of $2.48 a share.

MasterCard’s results were hurt by an after-tax severance charge of $38 million, or 19 cents a share, and a 25 percent increase in advertising expenses. On Wednesday, its larger rival, Visa, posted a 33 percent increase in quarterly profit, beating most analysts’ estimates. Both companies were spared the worst effects of the recession because they did not lend money, insulating them from record defaults last year.

Processed transactions during the quarter rose 6.7 percent, to 5.9 billion, MasterCard said. Revenue grew 6 percent, to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion, in line with the average estimate of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. Gross dollar volume, or the value of transactions processed by MasterCard, climbed 5.3 percent, to $674 billion on a local currency basis.

The company increased marketing and advertising expenses to $285.2 million in the fourth quarter, a 25 percent increase compared with the year-earlier period.

The chief financial officer, Martina Hund-Mejean, said in a telephone interview that MasterCard would probably exceed its 2009 currency-adjusted revenue growth of 3.9 percent, but probably would fall short of its previous average annual sales-growth target of 12 to 15 percent in 2010 and 2011.
1088 2010-02-05 Prosecutors on Thursday charged three former aides of a top governing party official with misreporting $4.4 million in political funds. But they said they did not have enough evidence to charge the official, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the Democratic Party. The opposition Liberal Democrats called for Mr. Ozawa to resign.
1089 2010-02-05 The United States is speeding up the delivery of dozens of bomb-detection dogs to Iraq after accusations that widely used mechanical devices were ineffective in detecting explosives, American and Iraqi officials said. The first shipment of dogs — 25 were expected Friday — comes amid pressure on Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki over security lapses.
1090 2010-02-05 For a certain breed of New York jazz fan the alto-saxophonist Wess Anderson is the one that got away. Nearly twice. Mr. Anderson, a Brooklyn native, emerged in the late 1980s as a sideman with Wynton Marsalis, and later a charter member of Mr. Marsalis’s efforts at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Fondly known as Warmdaddy, he was on board there until about four years ago, when he joined the jazz faculty at Michigan State University.

So Mr. Anderson was already missed, at least by Jazz at Lincoln Center regulars, when word got around that he had had a stroke in 2007, at 42. The left side of his body was numb, and for a time there were murmurs about whether he would play again. It actually ended up taking just a matter of months. But he didn’t find his way to a New York stage until a recent Jazz at Lincoln Center holiday concert. Now he’s making his first return as a bandleader, working with a quartet at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola through Sunday night.

He has first-rate partners: the pianist Marc Cary, the bassist Neal Caine and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts. Their history as a band is being determined on the spot, in the spirit of a highly pedigreed jam session. Wednesday’s first set stuck to a common-language jazz repertory, songs like “If I Were a Bell” and “There Is No Greater Love,” and Mr. Anderson mostly started right into them, trusting his band mates to find their way. (This backfired during “On Green Dolphin Street,” when he had to tip off Mr. Cary to the key.)

And how did he sound? Excellent, unchanged. His mellow, sweet-tart tone was a physical presence, and he gave it plenty of air, often holding a note for a long stretch, then taking a breath and modulating to another one. He also found room for his frolicsome side, conjugating quick little phrases with aplomb. In his alto style, there’s no chasm between the chivalrous croon of Johnny Hodges and the roguish charisma of Charlie Parker; he nodded to both in the set’s lone ballad, “If I Should Lose You,” though Hodges got the upper hand.

His connection with the band was sturdy, rooted in a 1950s hard-bop ideal. The agent of turbulence was Mr. Watts, whose casual swagger at the drums betrayed a contemporary pull. Though he never stopped swinging, he often added polyrhythmic counterweights. Mr. Anderson’s response was to dig in, holding firm to an implied quarter-note chug.

Near the end of the show several current stalwarts of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra — the tenor saxophonists Victor Goines and Walter Blanding Jr., and the pianist Dan Nimmer — joined him onstage. The highlight was an arrangement of “Caravan” originally devised by Mr. Marsalis. Throughout the set Mr. Anderson kept checking to see that his audience, well stocked with Jazz at Lincoln Center board members, was having fun. Here, for a few different reasons, he didn’t need to ask.
1091 2010-02-05 “In the past few days, we have learned that market activities are coming back in the North,” said a senior South Korean government official whose departmental regulations barred him from speaking on the record about North Korea. “But we are not sure yet whether this is a policy reversal effective throughout the North or is some temporary adjustment.”

North Korea had previously imposed price caps on the markets but had failed to arrest inflation, analysts in Seoul said. Daily NK’s report expressed doubt that the latest price controls would work. Although they were much higher than the ones reportedly announced shortly after the currency reform, the new prices set by the government were still lower than those on theblack market, it said.

The authorities were warning that those who ignored the price regulations would have their goods confiscated, Daily NK said.

Since 2005, North Korea had taken a series of steps aimed at suppressing the markets, banning food sales outside the state’s ration system, banishing young women from the markets and suppressing smuggling from China.

The strongest steps the government took against markets and the new class of traders who have profited from them began in late November when it abolished its old bank notes, requiring North Koreans to turn in their money for new bills at a rate of 100 to 1. By limiting how much they could turn in for the new currency to about $30 per person, the government wiped out much of private wealth, believing that that would help arrest inflation.

But prices of food and most other basic goods have since soared, as the state-run production and distribution system has not managed to meet demand.

Daily NK reported that after the government’s lifting of the private-trading ban, food prices in some towns began easing slightly. Yonhap reported that although markets reopened, people remained suspicious of the government’s intentions.

It is unclear whether protests in the North have had any destabilizing effect Mr. Kim’s government, which has survived for years despite a dismal economy and a devastating famine.

Some analysts said the seemingly mistaken economic policies could have a lasting impact. North Korea’s blunder with its currency “carried the risk of making North Koreans frustrated and fundamentally skeptical about their system and authorities,” said Cho Han-beom, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government research organization in Seoul.

He said a possible summit meeting being discussed between the Koreas might be a signal of the North’s need for outside aid to help defuse economic instability. The North’s economic plight deepened under United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear test last year. International food aid has also decreased during the nuclear standoff.

Yet others said they doubted that unrest was especially widespread or threatening to the government.

“People can protest, but large-scale protests are impossible in the North,” said Lee Dong-bok, a former high-ranking intelligence official in Seoul.

Mr. Lee said North Korean villages were divided into tiny cells that allowed the party and military members loyal to Mr. Kim to monitor each household and to block the spread of information.

For years, North Korea has openly admitted food shortages, but it has blamed “hostile” American policies that it said drove it to spend most of its resources to build arms. In the past week, North Korean news media quoted Mr. Kim as saying he would redouble his efforts to fulfill the government’s promise to feed its people with “rice and meat soup.”
1092 2010-02-05 Hollywood studios lost a copyright court case against an Australia Internet service provider on Thursday, Reuters reported, when a court ruled that the provider, iiNet, could not be held responsible for unauthorized downloads of movies using its service. The suit was filed by a group of studios including Universal Pictures, Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox and Disney. A federal court in Sydney ruled that it was impossible to hold iiNet responsible for users who might infringe copyright. iiNet contended that it was not required by law to act on allegations of copyright infringement; that customers were innocent until proven guilty; and that the case was comparable to suing a power company for the activities clients use electricity to engage in.
1093 2010-02-05 The idea of opera singers moving choreographically is tantalizing. About the specific fantasy of a dancing Carmen, however, I would caution, be careful what you wish for. Many great opera singers are just not built for dancing.

Choreography and opera directing are indeed related. But so are acting and opera directing, and it is just as valid for a director to focus on eliciting vivid acting from a vocally gifted cast. Dancing in opera can easily come off as exaggerated, awkward and, at worse, embarrassing. The performances of Mr. Garanca and Ms. Borodina as Carmen offered a telling comparison.

Mr. Eyre, an astute theatrical director, surely realized that Ms. Garanca, his beautiful Carmen, a compelling singer and skilled actress, exuded sexuality. By ridding the character of the typical hip-swiveling, skirt-rustling maneuvers, he helped Ms. Garanca bring raw realism and sultry allure to this touchstone role.

Ms. Garanca did no dancing during the “Habanera.” Instead, when she emerged for an afternoon break with the other female workers from a cigarette factory, depicted here as an underground sweatshop, she looked hot, sticky and frustrated. This voluptuous young Gypsy, who should be a kind of goddess, toils in stifling surroundings. She knows that she can use her sex appeal to control men. So, when she spots the wholesome Don José, who seems indifferent, she shifts into action.

While Ms. Garanca sang the “Habanera,” she wrung out her dingy work smock in an outdoor basin, then dribbled cool water on her bare leg, exposing her thigh. There was rhythmic insistence in her haunting singing, which the orchestra vividly supported. Still, her aim was to deliver the aria sensually acted and sung. Mission accomplished.

Alastair was especially critical of the scene in Act II when Don José, just released from military prison for having enabled Carmen to escape, finds her at the tavern. By now Carmen has decided that she wants him, that, in fact, she loves him, though none of Carmen’s loves endure. When they are alone, Carmen tells Don José that she will dance just for him.

Bizet writes into the score that Carmen then takes out castanets and begins to sing and dance. But what is really going on here? “I’m going to dance for you.” Yeah, right. She is going to seduce him, she means. Ms. Garanca quickly went about it.

As the music began, she picked up a tin cup and tapped some beats on it. Quickly tossing it aside, she began to ensnare the seated Don José, encircling him from behind with her legs, eventually sprawling on the floor invitingly. Maybe this bold staging was a little overwrought. But when you have Ms. Garanca as Carmen, why not?

Though Ms. Borodina, a great singer and charismatic artist, also dispensed with castanets in this scene, she did quite a bit more dancing, which was, to be honest, less than successful. In moments when, singing with chilling power, she came on to the helpless Don José, she was a convincing seductress. But she certainly lacks a dancer’s physique. You admired her gumption as she pivoted her ample hips and hoisted her arms. She did not look silly, but she did come off during her big dance as a clichéd, skirt-rustling Carmen. Her voice danced, however, when she dispatched the melodic turns in this melody with clarity and zest.

As Alastair pointed out, some great Carmens, Rosa Ponselle among them, have danced effectively. It is delightful to see Rise Stevens singing and dancing the “Habanera” in the 1944 movie “Going My Way,” in which she portrays an opera singer, Genevieve Linden, a friend to Bing Crosby’s Father O’Malley. This was before Ms. Stevens sang the role at the Met and set the standard for the sultry, dancing Carmen.

There are times when an opera simply demands that a singer dance, as in the “Dance of the Seven Veils” in Strauss’s “Salome.” Karita Mattila triumphed during this 10-minute dance in the Met’s 2004 production by Jürgen Flimm, though the scene was also a triumph for the choreographer Doug Varone, who gave Ms. Mattila, dressed in Dietrichian drag, three tuxedoed attendant male dancers to spin, twirl and lift her. Ms. Mattila’s possessed, writhing dance became, literally, a high-class mesmerizing striptease.

There is no question that movement in an opera production can convey what is going on in the music. Yet there are many times when it is best to let the music work its magic without physical gestures to enhance the singing. A good example in the new “Carmen” came during the Act I chorus for the workers on break from the cigarette factory. Lolling about, tired and listless in the Seville sun, the women simply sat in the town square while they described in song the way the scented smoke from their cigarettes rises to the sky. They were almost motionless. But in their dreamy singing, accompanied by the luxurious orchestra, Bizet’s music danced.
1094 2010-02-05 MUNICH — Romania’s top defense body approved an American proposal to base missile interceptors there, the country’s president said Thursday in a hastily arranged announcement.

The president, Traian Basescu, said in a statement that Romania, a former Warsaw Pact member and now part of NATO, was prepared to negotiate with the United States to accept ground-based interceptors as part of an antiballistic missile defense system. He said it could be working by 2015.

While the participation of Poland and the Czech Republic in the missile shield had been well known, the possibility that Romania would join them was not.

Romania made its announcement as Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was in Turkey for a NATO meeting. He was not immediately available to comment but the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said the announcement was welcomed. “We’re pleased that Romania has agreed to participate in that defense shield,” he told reporters in Washington.

Political analysts in Romania said the speed of Mr. Basescu’s announcement appeared to be an attempt to capitalize on the agreement at the expense of political rivals at home, where most view a deepening of ties with the United States favorably and where Mr. Basescu narrowly won re-election in December.
1095 2010-02-05 Mr. Lieberman was responding to strident comments from Syria on Wednesday. Mr. Assad told the visiting Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, that Israel was “not serious about achieving peace” and that the facts indicated that “Israel is pushing the region toward war, not peace,” according to the Syrian news agency SANA.

Furthermore, the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Wednesday that “Israel should not test Syria’s determination,” adding, “Israel knows that war will move to the Israeli cities.”

He implied that a conflict beginning in South Lebanon could also lead to an all-out war.

Mr. Moallem made his comments in response to a strong statement made by Israel’s defense minister, Ehud Barak, to senior Israeli Army officers on Monday, warning that “in the absence of an arrangement with Syria, we are liable to enter a belligerent clash with it that could reach the point of an all-out, regional war.”

Israelis understood Mr. Barak’s remark as a plea for the Israeli government to start new peace negotiations with Syria, but the Syrians apparently interpreted it as warmongering.

Israel’s northern borders with Lebanon and Syria are quiet, but tense. The last Israel-Syria war was in 1973; Israel last fought Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia that receives support from Syria, in Lebanon in 2006.

Israeli military officials have warned repeatedly that Hezbollah has been rearming, and they assert that Syria has been preparing its military to move from the conventional battlefield into missiles that can be aimed at Israeli cities.

Mr. Lieberman said the Syrians had issued a “direct threat” to Israel that “crossed a line.”

“We cannot continue with business as usual,” he said.

Shaul Mofaz, a former Israeli Army chief and defense minister, and now a senior member of the opposition centrist Kadima Party, described Mr. Lieberman’s statements as “irresponsible.”

“They are liable to lead to verbal escalation or other types of escalation,” Mr. Mofaz told Israel Radio.

Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he is ready to talk to the Syrians without preconditions on either side.

But Syria expects a guarantee from Israel up front that it is willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Syria lost in the 1967 war.

There are sharp differences within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, not least over whether a deal with Syria would succeed in removing Syria from the Iranian sphere.

“Those who think that territorial concessions will cause a severance of the ties between Syria and the axis of evil are deluding themselves and avoiding reality,” Mr. Lieberman said Thursday, referring to Iran with a term used by former President George W. Bush.

Syria, he added, “will have to give up on its ultimate demand for the Golan Heights.”

Yet with the Palestinian peace process at an impasse, there have been increasing voices in Israel for a refocus on negotiations with Syria.

“Because of the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the only chance for generating change lies in the north,” wrote the commentator Ari Shavit in Thursday’s issue of the newspaper Haaretz. “There is no certainty at all that peace is in the offing,” he continued. “But if it is, it is to be found not in Ramallah but in Damascus.”

The previous Israeli government, under the lead of Ehud Olmert of Kadima, held indirect talks with Syria through Turkish mediators, but they ended when Israel started its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza.

The Palestinians have refused to engage in direct talks with Mr. Netanyahu’s government unless it carries out a total freeze of settlement construction, at least for a few months, including in East Jerusalem.

Mr. Netanyahu hinted on Wednesday that he was ready to engage instead in “proximity” talks with the Palestinians, via American mediation.

“In the Middle East it sometimes takes three to tango, or at least to start to tango,” Mr. Netanyahu told an audience at the annual Herzliya Conference. “Afterwards,” he said, “I assume we can go on to dance as a couple.”

The Palestinians have not yet stated whether they are ready for indirect talks.
1096 2010-02-05 Facing food shortages, severe price increases and social unrest, North Korea appears to have relaxed, at least temporarily, its broad crackdown on private markets, news reports and officials in Seoul said Thursday.     If confirmed, the move to al...

1098 2010-02-06 There are many ways to say "I love you,'' especially with Valentine's Day around the corner. But here's how some famous New Yorkers did it....
1099 2010-02-06 Patrick qualified in 12th place for the race, the leading driver among the women. She said that aside from Munter, a friend to whom she loaned a HANS safety device this week, “I don’t really know the rest of the girls out there.” She added: “I’m sure at some point I will meet them. If not, it’s a matter of circumstance.”

In fact, Patrick and Duno crossed paths during a practice for an IndyCar race in Ohio in 2008. They had an angry exchange prompted by Patrick’s contention that she was repeatedly blocked by Duno, who responded by twice throwing a towel at her.

On Friday, Duno sat serenely in the back of her trailer, which was parked next to Patrick’s, and said it was “a coincidence” that she decided to venture into stock-car racing a few days after Patrick did.

“It just happened at the same time,” Duno said with a shrug.

“Every year I had an offer for the Busch Series,” she added, referring to the Nascar minor-league circuit now known as the Nationwide Series. “So this is not something new.”

When Duno was asked how she would describe her relationship with Patrick, she demurred.

“Can I pass to the next question?” Duno said. “That is my answer.”

Doug Stringer of Stringer Motorsports, who owns the Toyota that Duno is racing, used to sponsor another woman, Gabi DiCarlo. “There are some female drivers out there,” Stringer said, “who have more ability than 80 percent of the male field.”

As Stringer was talking, Owens walked up. “Like this one right here,” he said.

Owens, 21, grew up in South Daytona Beach. Her parents own a commercial cleaning business and could not support her driving dream. So, when she was 13, Owens put together a publicity kit, hopped on her bicycle and solicited donations from all the companies she could visit and still make her 8 p.m. curfew.

By the time she was 15, Owens had raised $10,000, she said, “which paid for tires and gas.”

At the dirt tracks where Owens gained racing experience, it didn’t matter that drivers like Sara Christian, Louise Smith and Ethel Mobley had driven in Nascar races as far back as the 1940s and 1950s. Owens experienced the isolation reserved for trailblazers.

“It was so much harder than anything ARCA or Nascar can throw at me,” she said. She added: “You almost have to play the guy role for a little bit, get respect and then switch and play the girl role. That’s exactly what I did.”

On the track, Owens said, she never worries about running out of gas, only money. She envies Patrick for being able to drive a Chevrolet co-owned by Dale Earnhardt Jr.

“To do this right,” Owens said, “you need to have the best equipment, and Danica obviously has that.”

She added: “There’s a lot of women who have tried Nascar but not one that has succeeded, and a lot of it has had to do with their equipment. I hope Danica really has an appreciation of what she’s representing. There are so many females who would like to be in her position.”
1100 2010-02-06 BEIJING (AP) — An American missionary arrived in Beijing on Saturday after being freed by North Korea, which had detained him for illegally crossing its border from China on Christmas Day.

The missionary, Robert Park, appeared pale and drawn as United States consular officials escorted him from a North Korean plane at Beijing’s airport. He did not say anything.

Susan Stevenson, a spokeswoman for the United States Embassy, said that Mr. Park would leave later in the day for the United States.

On Friday, North Korea announced it would free Mr. Park, saying he had shown “sincere repentance.”

Mr. Park, 28, slipped across the frozen Tumen River into North Korea carrying letters calling on its leader, Kim Jong-il, to close the country’s notoriously brutal prison camps and step down from power — statements that could bring a death sentence. The North Korean government decided, however, “to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” the official Korean Central News Agency said.

The news agency quoted Mr. Park, of Tucson, Ariz., as saying he was ashamed of the “biased” view he had once held of North Korea. He did not respond Saturday to questions from reporters at Beijing’s airport asking whether he had been speaking freely or under duress.
1101 2010-02-06 While Ms. Silsby, 40, and another member of the group, Charisa Coulter, 24, Ms. Silsby’s live-in nanny, were involved in the planning for the trip, some of the others appear to have learned about it through e-mail messages forwarded among friends, families and church members.

All were said to have swiftly decided to go.

Robert Lankford, whose daughter-in-law, Corinna Lankford, and granddaughter, Nicole Lankford, 18, are among those being held in Haiti, said, “Corinna was just saying we’re going to help those little kids that don’t have anything.”

Nicole Lankford plays the piano and helps lead the youth worship at Central Valley Baptist Church, the same church Ms. Silsby attends, Mr. Lankford said. “Never said a swear word, never smoked a smoke, never drank,” he said. “She’s a very devout girl.”

Now Mr. Lankford and the family members of some of the others being held in Haiti are desperate to get them released. Mr. Lankford’s son met with leaders at Central Valley Baptist on Friday in an effort to get help from the American government. Several people here have been critical of what they said was an insufficient effort on the part of the government to help the group. American officials have said Haiti is handling the case transparently.

“I’m at my wits’ end,” Mr. Lankford said. “All they did was try to help.”

In the rushed days before the group left, they collected donations of clothing, diapers, baby formula and toys. Corinna Lankford’s 16-year-old son, Daniel, said he went to dentists’ offices to ask for donations of toothpaste and toothbrushes.

Mr. Lankford said the group filled 15 large plastic bins with supplies and paid more than $1,000 in extra luggage costs for their flight to the Dominican Republic.

“Those are not things that criminals take and pay to do it anyhow,” he said, adding that his daughter-in-law and granddaughter packed only small bags for themselves.

Corinna Lankford, the mother of six, has home-schooled all of her children, Daniel said. He said his mother and Nicole had once traveled to Ecuador on a mission trip to help build and clean churches.

Family and friends of the group members have said little critical of Ms. Silsby or the churches that helped promote the trip. Mr. Lankford said that he was not sure how well his family members knew Ms. Silsby, but that their understanding was that logistical and legal details in Haiti were “being taken care of.”

Haitian officials say Ms. Silsby lacked documentation to take custody of and travel with the children. A lawyer in Haiti for the group, Edwin Coq, suggested to reporters this week that Ms. Silsby might face a difficult prosecution.

The events have also prompted scrutiny of Ms. Silsby in Idaho, exposing a complicated financial history with lawsuits pending against her and a house lost to foreclosure.

When Mr. Coq was asked about the other nine Americans, he echoed their friends and relatives here: “completely innocent,” he said.

Central Valley Baptist, which had allowed members of the news media to work in its common areas earlier in the week, locked its doors after the Americans were charged on Thursday afternoon and would not allow the press in on Friday.

Five of the Americans attend Central Valley, and three attend East Side Baptist in Twin Falls. One is from a Baptist church in Kansas. Another, Jim Allen, Mr. Thompson’s cousin, lives in Amarillo, Tex., where he owns a small welding shop.

An employee at the shop said Mr. Allen had received an e-mail message about the Haiti trip through a church in Amarillo that his parents and Paul Thompson’s parents attend.

“He decided to go help,” said the employee, Linda Hand. “He was very excited to go help the children. That’s just the type of heart that he has, and we’re all very proud of him.”
1102 2010-02-06 Howard Mudd, the Indianapolis Colts’ offensive line coach, remembers those days clearly.

Mudd recalled that before a preseason game, between the N.F.L.’s Detroit Lions and the A.F.L.’s Denver Broncos, Alex Karras, the Lions’ star defensive tackle, declared that he would “walk home if these guys beat us.”

Mudd recalled: “They didn’t just beat them, they beat them soundly. I don’t think Alex walked home, but that was all real. It was an us-against-them thing. We wanted to prove that those guys didn’t belong here. It was very exciting, very charged.”

Mudd played for the N.F.L.’s San Francisco 49ers and the Chicago Bears from 1964 to 1970. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection. He made his first Pro Bowl team after the 1966 season, when Green Bay played Kansas City in the first championship. Mudd attended the game.

“I sat there and watched it and I was so passionate about the N.F.L. winning,” he said. “We had to.”

They did; Jan. 15, 1967, was pro football Armageddon. Green Bay defeated Kansas City, 35-10. The next year, Green Bay defeated the Oakland Raiders, 33-14, in the second championship. The N.F.L.’s victories confirmed what many football fans believed.

“We had the best players,” Mudd said. “That’s what we thought.”

Sometimes, A.F.L. teams outbid the N.F.L. for star players. Emerson Boozer, a running back from Maryland State, was drafted by both leagues but chose the A.F.L.’s Jets.

Boozer remembers that when the Jets earned the right to play the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, he and his teammates felt as if they were on a mission.

“We felt a sense of pride, having reached the game, and a duty to respond to the challenge because we were representing a league,” he said. “That was huge. We were representing a league and all of its ownership and players. We were it.

“Even though they had agreed on a merger, we were still operating as the American Football League versus the National Football League.”

The Colts were regarded, along with the Packers, as the best team in the N.F.L., hence the best in football.

Joe Namath predicted a Jets victory and his teammates backed it up, winning, 16-7. The victory triggered euphoria not unlike the hope surrounding the New Orleans Saints 41 years later in Super Bowl XLIV.

After the victory, Boozer received calls and notes of congratulations.

“You’d get calls from guys from the A.F.L. congratulating you and thanking you for the victory,” he said. “When you’d run across one of them during the off-season, they would congratulate you for representing the league so well. It proved to the football world that the A.F.L. was not a fly-by-night league; it was a legitimate football league. The players were grateful.”

Mudd said that N.F.L. players were impressed by the Jets’ victory but not sold on the A.F.L.

“For them to back it up and beat one of the best teams in the N.F.L. was really quite a start for me,” he said.

But the denial was so great that even when the Jets won, many N.F.L. players refused to give them credit for their accomplishment. They cited the fact that the Colts’ longtime quarterback, Johnny Unitas, was not at his best, having missed much of the season with an arm injury.

When Kansas City routed the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV, though, minds were changed. “I thought, Maybe it’s O.K. if they win,” Mudd said.

In many ways, Super Bowl XLIV, largely because of the Saints, has the feel of that old A.F.L.-N.F.L. rivalry.

For many of us, the Colts, dumped into the American Football Conference in 1970 as part of the merger deal, are still part of the old N.F.L. The Saints, established as an N.F.L. team in 1966 and now in the National Football Conference, have the feel of an A.F.L. team. As Saints linebacker Scott Fujita said: “We’re a team of mutts, a kind of gumbo. People from all over the place, a bunch of undrafted free agents, guys who were traded, guys like Drew Brees and I who were discarded by previous teams. That’s what makes the team so special. There’s a common purpose.”

Those old days are gone. The Super Bowl has grown beyond belief at the expense of a certain soulful magic.

From Super Bowl V forward, the games have effectively pitted two divisions of the same gigantic corporation against each another. Regardless of the result, the corporation wins. Everyone gets to go to the beach.

“A.F.C.-N.F.C.? I don’t know what that means,” Mudd said. “I knew what the A.F.L. and N.F.L. meant. It was us against them.”

Somehow, us against them strikes a more resonant chord.
1103 2010-02-06 As overall commander of the Pakistani Taliban, Mr. Mehsud held sway over Orakzai, wielding as much power there as in his native South Waziristan, or even more.

Since his disappearance from the scene, the local militant commanders in Orakzai may now be seeking to exert their own identity and independence.

Mr. Noor Jamal had been close to Mr. Mehsud, one factor that might be in his favor if he does seek to replace him. He also maintains an intimidating reputation for brutality, something the video appears to support.

“He kills humans like one will kill chickens,” said one resident who left Kurram last year because he was wanted by Mr. Noor Jamal’s forces. He and another resident spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.

Mr. Noor Jamal, according to different accounts, is in his late 30s and was a teacher and prayer leader at a local religious school before he was made the leader of the Taliban in Kurram by Mr. Mehsud.

The video, which originated from a cellphone, was reportedly made in a village in Orakzai called Mamozai, the home of Mr. Mehsud’s second wife, who, according to unconfirmed reports, was present when he died. Orakzai is one of the most strategically situated parts of the tribal areas because of its proximity to more settled parts of the North-West Frontier Province and its capital, Peshawar.

Pakistani security officials say Orakzai has become a prime Taliban stronghold, particularly because many of the Taliban fighters who fled the Pakistani Army’s operation in South Waziristan have taken refuge there. Because of its location, it has also become a hub for other militant commanders allied with the Pakistani Taliban, who include local residents as well as Taliban from Punjab Province.

The so-called Punjabi Taliban come mostly from banned sectarian groups that have also taken refuge there. Last year, a Polish engineer abducted in Punjab was held captive and eventually killed in Orakzai.

Most of the attacks in Peshawar and other parts of the North-West Frontier Province have now been traced to the militants in Orakzai. The militants operate their own courts and in some cases even collect taxes.

The region has a sizable Shiite minority, and last year Shiites were made to pay an Islamic tax, ostensibly to ensure their security, in order to be allowed to remain in Orakzai. The Shiites have been made a special target of brutality and violence by the Taliban, who follow a strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

Three beheaded bodies were found Friday in lower Orakzai after the victims were abducted by suspected Taliban, according to a nearby resident.

The circulation of the video at this time may be because of the simmering resentment among local people against the harsh Taliban methods, or a way for them or others to encourage the military to open another front in an area where past peace deals with the Taliban have allowed the militants to tighten their hold.
1104 2010-02-06 But there is no doubt that the banks have not fallen all over themselves to lend as it is, even with many billions of dollars in government-supplied capital. Something like 95 percent of the American mortgage market now depends on government guarantees, through Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or the Federal Housing Administration.

At some point, that share has to decline drastically as the government steps back. And it is reasonable to think a securitization market could be part of the answer.

But how to do it? The old private securitization failed for a variety of reasons. Loan underwriting standards vanished in part because the people making the loans concluded they would profit from fees for arranging the loans, whether or not they were ever repaid. Regulators stood aside, thinking they had no power over many players.

Investors in the securitizations did not do their homework, either assuming that rising housing prices made such work unnecessary or that the quality of the loans was being policed by bond rating agencies, which were doing no such thing.

There are several essential elements to any fix. The underlying loans have to be of better quality. The investors have to believe that is the case and that they are being compensated for risks that were much higher than they previously believed. Another 30 percent collapse in home prices is unlikely, but it will be a while before anyone’s models deem such a thing impossible.

There are two ways being suggested to deal with the quality issue. Mr. Dugan favors using government edicts to set lending standards. Other officials want to find ways to use the market system to promote better lending.

The principle market-based approach now being pushed is called “skin in the game.” Force a banker to hold onto some part of the loan — and details of just how much, or in what form, are subject to debate — and he will act better.

In an interview, Mr. Dugan said he was not necessarily opposed to such rules, but he had a lot of doubt about them. First, there are accounting issues. The accounting rules are not clear, and even if they were, banking regulators like Mr. Dugan could allow the banks to deviate from them in computing capital. But the reformed rules do make it harder for banks to get loans off their balance sheets if they retain any stake in them. And capital must be held against assets that are kept on the balance sheets.

In his speech, Mr. Dugan said he thought off-balance sheet treatment was vital to getting the securitization market moving again, and that meant a “skin in the game” rule could be perverse.

“A requirement intended to improve the securitization market by improving the quality and trustworthiness of underwriting could significantly curtail the number of securitizations that are actually done,” he said. “And that, of course, could materially reduce the amount of credit available for housing or any of the other sectors that have traditionally benefited from securitizations.”

There was, he said, a simple question to be asked: “Instead of going at the underwriting problem indirectly through ‘skin in the game’ requirements, why not attack it directly?” Why not enact regulations to force lenders to lend responsibly?

He talked of requiring lenders to actually check income of borrowers, and to set minimum down payment rules. But he was vague on how low the down payments should be. The F.H.A. still requires only 3 percent, which may be too low, but raising it would be politically explosive.

Moreover, it is hard to envision rules that cannot be evaded by someone who wishes to do so. Bank examiners cannot check every loan.

There is also the real possibility of political interference. It is not hard to imagine a bank telling someone he could not get a mortgage because of a stupid government rule, and that person complaining to his congressman. It might really be absurd to deny that person a loan, but changing the rule could weaken it for others who might be less worthy borrowers.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is considering imposing some kind of “skin in the game” rule for securitizations, forcing a lending bank to hold on to part of the risk of default.

“We must have better loans,” Michael H. Krimminger, the deputy for policy to the F.D.I.C.’s chairman, Sheila C. Bair, said in an interview. “One way is to have regulatory fiat. That is important, but it is not sufficient.”

If the private securitization market is to be revived, would-be investors will have to be persuaded there are better safeguards. Such persuasion seems likely to include more disclosures, more time for investors to review loans before securitizations are completed and perhaps some rules to assure that mortgages are not securitized until the borrower has met several monthly payments.

Even then, it might be difficult to persuade investors to trust in loans made by lenders who are unloading all the risks on investors.

Mortgages are highly dependent on individual facts that are not easy for an investor to review. Is the borrower really responsible? Is the house really worth this much? It was mortgage lenders who bribed assessors to overstate the value of homes so the mortgages would go through. At a minimum, any new securitization system should take away that incentive from the lender.

The beauty of Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” is that it leads players to maximize the welfare of all by seeking to maximize their own welfare. But that hand is diverted in perverse ways if the player thinks it can profit from making a bad loan. A reformed securitization market may need to rely in part on bringing back that invisible hand.
1105 2010-02-06 Mr. Kannam, then 33, became Wesleyan’s first in-house investment strategist. In a glowing 2006 profile in the alumni magazine, Mr. Kannam was praised for meeting the goal set by the university’s president: putting Wesleyan’s return on its endowment in the top 5 of the 20 highest-rated liberal arts colleges in the annual U.S. News & World Report survey.

Since the financial crisis, Wesleyan’s endowment has contracted along with everyone else’s, falling 24 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2009. A spokesman, David Pesci, said the endowment was now worth about $530 million.

According to the lawsuit, Mr. Kannam was expected to devote “his complete professional time and energies” to the university. The president of Wesleyan, Michael S. Roth, had given Mr. Kannam permission to serve on only the boards of two community service organizations, the suit said.

Matthew Hamill, senior vice president of the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said that moonlighting by college investment officers was not typical. “I’m not familiar with other institutions where a chief investment officer might have done the kinds of things that Wesleyan has alleged,” he said.

Mr. Kannam, who was fired from Wesleyan in October, was named in the suit along with his wife, Heather L. McCutchen, a playwright he met while they were students at Dartmouth. Also named were several business associates and investment companies. Wesleyan is seeking $3 million in damages.

Messages left on a phone listed in Mr. Kannam’s name in Durham, Conn., were not returned. However, a lawyer for Mr. Kannam, Stephen J. Fitzgerald, defended his client, saying, “There’s not a single allegation in Wesleyan’s complaint that a single dollar of endowment money was misappropriated or somehow invested improperly in violation of any conflict of interest.”

“Instead,” he said, “Wesleyan’s allegations are based in misunderstanding and exaggeration.”

At issue is the wording of Mr. Kannam’s contract and whether it gave him leeway to pursue outside ventures. The contract, according to the lawsuit, said that he “shall not accept any positions on boards or other activities, compensatory or otherwise, that would take meaningful time away from his responsibilities.”

Martin Stein, a lawyer who represents Belstar Group, an investment company named in the suit, said both Mr. Kannam and Belstar “will testify that nothing he did for Belstar detracted” from his work at Wesleyan.

Wesleyan claims that the majority of Mr. Kannam’s e-mail messages and a “significant portion” of his phone calls related to his outside ventures. Those ranged from various investment funds to a Massachusetts company, Advance Device Technology, founded by his father and in which Mr. Kannam was director of business development.

While making $460,000 a year at Wesleyan, Mr. Kannam held the title of director of investment at Belstar Group, which has offices in Manhattan. While Wesleyan asserts that Mr. Kannam charged the university for weekly trips to New York for Belstar, Mr. Stein said that he visited Belstar “only about once every three or four weeks” and used his Belstar credit card.

The lawsuit also details a number of other trips — Disney World with his family, India for a wedding, England for a job interview — that Mr. Kannam claimed were work related, citing nearby conferences, and for which he filed expenses.

In India, for instance, Mr. Kannam, who was born in Southeast India, told Wesleyan that he was attending a conference in which the host was a man named Ratan Tata. “Not only was no such conference held,” the lawsuit said, “but Ratan Tata is, in fact, an official adviser to Belstar Group.”

In perhaps the most egregious example cited in the lawsuit under the heading “fraudulent expenses,” Wesleyan said that Mr. Kannam traveled to Britain with his wife and children in 2006 to interview for a position at Cambridge University.

“Not only was the trip reimbursed by Cambridge University,” the lawsuit states, “but he fraudulently used his Wesleyan credit card for trip expenses, as well as submitted fraudulent and redundant cash expense reports to Wesleyan for the same trip expenses.”

The university also accused Mr. Kannam of pressing for more staff and using them to do research for his own activities. “Send me a list of things you’d like done with the hedge fund data so that I can get my guys working on it,” Mr. Kannam wrote to a partner at Belstar Group.

The lawsuit said that Mr. Kannam lobbied to move his offices to a secluded spot on campus so he could “work on his personal ‘entrepreneurial ventures’ away from the view of others in North College,” the main administration building. He relocated to newly renovated space, which he called the “Taj,” the suit said.

Wesleyan highlighted several e-mail exchanges to show that Mr. Kannam concealed his activities and understood the conflict of interest. As the university was revising its conflict of interest policy, for example, the lawsuit says that Mr. Kannam’s wife sent him an e-mail saying the new policy seemed “tailor-made” to apply to him. “Oucheroo,” she remarked.

While the suit against Mr. Kannam is potentially embarrassing for Wesleyan, Ada Meloy, general counsel for the American Council on Education, praised the school for pursuing it anyway. “Colleges and universities do not seek to have publicity that reveals unpleasantness,” she said. “But it is something that they are right in going forward with in order to reclaim assets. It takes real effort to tackle a problem like this.”

But Mr. Stein, the lawyer for Belstar, said that he believes that Wesleyan was “looking for a scapegoat” for its recent endowment losses. “There’s no claim that because Kannam was spending so much time on Belstar and others, that he did not do his job properly and or that Wesleyan lost money because of that,” he said. “Wesleyan’s silence on these things speaks very, very loudly. It’s a real hatchet job.”
1106 2010-02-06 The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to consider dismissing a case on the rights of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, after the Swiss government said it would accept transfer of two inmates involved in the dispute. The solicitor general said that the transfer agreement, which involves two Chinese Uighurs, eliminates “the factual premise presented in this case.” The court is scheduled to hear arguments March 23 about whether judges can order release of nondangerous Guantánamo prisoners into the United States. The federal government has said the Uighurs do not pose a threat to the United States.
1107 2010-02-06 Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he “was not surprised” by how few got shots.

“But that could all change overnight if we get a third wave in late February — and we still could,” he added. “That would make this half-time data, not end-of-the-game data.”

Dr. Anne Schuchat, the C.D.C.’s director of immunization and respiratory disease, who in early January urged all Americans to get shots because they had finally become plentiful, put a brave face on the low figures, saying she was “encouraged” because more children got shots than ever previously got regular flu shots and because many got them at school for the first time. If that became routine, it could lead to much wider flu protection because schoolchildren often are the vectors that infect their families.

“I, of course, hope we can do better in future years,” Dr. Schuchat said.

Across the country, flu activity is below normal for this time of year, she said, although hospitalizations and deaths continue. Nine children died of confirmed swine flu in the last week of January, according to weekly data released Friday. The C.D.C. estimates that about 1,000 children have succumbed to it since April.

The new strain continues to “crowd out” seasonal flu this winter. Only 2 out of 119 samples subtyped were not swine flu, according to the agency’s weekly FluView report.

The data contain one anomaly officials cannot explain: For the third week in a row, the proportion of all death certificates in the country listing pneumonia as the cause of death was well above normal. A week ago, New York City officials noted the same phenomenon, and they are investigating it.

Epidemiologists do not know what caused the pneumonia deaths, which are mostly in elderly patients. Most patients, even in hospitals, are never autopsied. Usually to find the cause of the pneumonia doctors must get a sputum sample to culture in a laboratory, which requires pushing a tube deep into a patient’s lungs. Doctors usually spare patients that ordeal and just keep changing antibiotics, hoping to find one that works. Over half the time, even lung samples grow out nothing that explains why a patient died.

What samples the C.D.C. knows of, Dr. Schuchat said, were routine germs like rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.

The Harvard polling data was of 1,419 adults, including 377 parents, and had a margin of error of three percentage points for the total response. It found that 21 percent of those polled had been vaccinated, and 15 percent intended to by the end of February. Of the parents, 40 percent had had their children vaccinated, and 13 percent intended to.

The centers estimated that 23 percent of all Americans had been vaccinated, and 37 percent of all those under 18 had. It polled 4,110 people and said the margin of error was three percentage points for the estimate of all Americans vaccinated and seven percentage points for the estimate on children.

In Harvard’s poll, 59 percent rated the response by public health officials to the swine flu pandemic “good” or “excellent.”

More than three-quarters remembered seeing or hearing some sort of public health announcement urging them to get vaccinated.
1108 2010-02-06 As Danspace Project’s Platform series, “i get lost,” continues, we have more a sense of what has been found. On Thursday night Ralph Lemon, who organized the programming, introduced two more choreographers: Judith Sánchez Ruíz, who was born in Havana, and Souleymane Badolo, who hails from Burkina Faso.

In “And They Forgot to Love,” Ms. Sánchez Ruíz, whose work teeters between composition and improvisation, aspires to reach a state in her dancing in which the body leads: it’s her way of getting lost. The first image is especially haunting. She stands at the far end of the stage as lights gradually illuminate her immobile form. A shadow spilling across her feet resembles a pedestal; she could be a statue.

Ms. Sánchez Ruíz’s beauty, which shifts from incandescent to ferocious, is unmatched. Her curly hair, gathered on top of her head in a perfect puff, is accentuated by her costume, a black lace skirt and half a bustier made of white tape that is applied in strips directly onto her skin. She moves forward with vigor, slicing her arms and elbows with mechanical precision or, later, slipping to the floor and scampering forward on her hips as her knees splay to either side.

Throughout the dance, Ms. Sánchez Ruíz’s voice is heard on a recording reciting autobiographical text; most of it is in Spanish, though snippets emerge in English, like, “I’m worried about being a mother,” or “I’m worried about my need to dance.”

In “Yaado,” Mr. Badolo also draws from a personal place. Dedicated to his dead mother, who bore 15 children (only 3 survived), “Yaado,” which means “cemetery” in Gurunsi, was one of the names Mr. Badolo was given after his birth as a mode of protection.

The dance, which features Diabate Youb playing the cora, a string instrument, and Kanoté Mamadou on the tama, or drums, begins as Mr. Badolo recites some of his history in French and Gurunsi. Moving within rectangular shapes of light, he searches for an intersection between the performance and spiritual worlds. He crouches, slowly leaning his torso back while undulating his hips in sharp twitches.
1109 2010-02-06 MOSCOW — Russian officials reacted coolly on Friday to the news that Romania had agreed to host American missile interceptors starting in 2015, with a top envoy saying that the announcement could directly affect Moscow’s position as negotiations to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, reach their conclusion.

Dmitri O. Rogozin, Russia’s permanent representative to NATO, said the United States had not fulfilled its promise to consult Russia on developments in the missile defense system. He suggested that the interceptors could pose a threat to Russia’s security, while noting that both Romanian and American officials went out of their way to assure Moscow otherwise.

“It seems to be in line with Freud’s theory — it means they have some thoughts that the system could be targeted against Russia, otherwise why would they dissuade us about something we never asked about?” he said.

Though the general outlines of the new missile defense plan — including the staging of land-based interceptors in Europe — were made public months ago, Russian officials made it clear that they were taken aback by the announcement of Romania’s role. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov said the Russian and American presidents had agreed that the “threats and risks of missile proliferation will be assessed jointly as a first step.”

“We expect our American partners to provide exhaustive explanations on those issues in the context of this dialogue,” the Interfax news service quoted Mr. Lavrov as saying at a news conference in Germany, where he traveled to attend the Munich Security Conference.
1110 2010-02-06 “This is an extremely compelling transaction with undeniable strategic and industrial logic that would benefit shareholders, customers and employees of both companies,” Air Products’ chief executive, John E. McGlade, said in a statement. “We highly value the talented operating team at Airgas, and believe they would benefit greatly from the expanded opportunities and resources available to them as part of a larger and stronger global U.S. company with significantly greater long-term growth prospects than a stand-alone Airgas.”

A deal between Air Products and Airgas would create one of the biggest players in the industrial gases market. Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., specializes in liquid bulk gases like oxygen, nitrogen and argon for industries like semiconductors and the National Aeronautic and Space Administration. Airgas has a strong market share in packaged gases, including nitrous oxide and dry ice, for the North American market. Air Products’ competing packaged-gases business is rooted largely in international markets like Europe.

In a letter, Mr. McGlade told Peter McCausland, chief executive of Airgas, that he was “disappointed” that two previous offers were rebuffed over the last four months. The two held a meeting several months ago in which they agreed on the merits of a merger, but Airgas has since refused to consider any approach from Air Products, the people briefed on the matter said.

“In our prior correspondence, we clearly and repeatedly stated our flexibility as to both value and form of consideration, yet you have continued to refuse even to discuss our offers,” Mr. McGlade wrote in the letter. “Your unwillingness to engage has delayed the ability of your shareholders to receive a substantial premium.”

While Air Products says it believes it can entice enough Airgas shareholders — the latter’s stock has fallen about 5 percent in the last six months — it must win over the company’s biggest stakeholder: Mr. McCausland, who founded Airgas in 1982 and owns about a 10 percent stake. He is one of the directors up for re-election this year.

In a letter sent last month rejecting a previous — and higher — offer from Air Products, Mr. McCausland wrote that Airgas had outperformed its competitor over the past decade, with the exception of 2009, and that a merger would destroy value.

Air Products contends that the deal would save the companies up to $250 million a year in costs and preserve jobs in Pennsylvania, where both are based.

The two companies have a fairly large common investor base: 34 percent of Air Products shareholders hold stakes in both companies, compared with 39 percent of Airgas shareholders.

Air Products has secured committed debt financing from its financial adviser, JPMorgan Chase. It has also hired the law firms Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Arnold & Porter.
1111 2010-02-06 “My goal in politics from the very beginning has been, and will be, the goal of giving Ukraine a chance to finally secure a firm footing in the world as a competitive, independent and real European state,” she said.

“I ask you in these final days to help Ukraine — and me — to help everyone who today has stood up to defend Ukraine,” she said. “I ask you, people who care about the soul of Ukraine, those who want to preserve the heart, the spirit and the faith of our country for future generations, to please defend it.”

MS. TYMOSHENKO, 49, may be the underdog, but her emphatic delivery underscores that she is by no means on the ropes. On Thursday, she threatened protests if the campaign of her opponent, Viktor F. Yanukovich, committed fraud, in what would be a repeat of the Orange Revolution. She charged that Mr. Yanukovich pushed through a last-minute amendment to the election law this week so that his campaign would have an advantage in the ballot counting. President Viktor A. Yushchenko, a former Orange ally of Ms. Tymoshenko who lost his bid for another term last month, sided with Mr. Yanukovich and approved the law.

Each side has accused the other of planning to steal the election, but given how disenchanted many people are, major demonstrations seem unlikely.

Ms. Tymoshenko has long had a reputation as an intense competitor, shifting her stances, alliances and images as she has risen through the ranks. Ukraine is split by a linguistic and geographic divide, and when Ms. Tymoshenko got her start in politics, she was a Russian speaker from the east with long dark hair. Now, she is a champion of the Ukrainian language, with its base in the western half of the country.

More recently, she has changed her tone toward neighboring Russia. Once a staunch critic of the Kremlin, she is promising to patch things up and has even praised Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.

Her detractors contend that Ms. Tymoshenko is a secret admirer of Mr. Putin and would govern as he has, with the same strong-arm tactics. They also say that her tendency to engage in political brawls undercuts her ability to govern.

“I do not believe that she is a democrat,” said Yosyp Vinsky, who was Ms. Tymoshenko’s transportation minister before resigning last year and accusing her of poor management and unethical behavior. (Her aides said he himself had ethics issues.)

“She is more of a P.R. expert than a real leader,” said Mr. Vinsky, who said he was not backing Mr. Yanukovich, either.

“And she is absolutely an autocrat who is willing to spit on the law and stamp on the Constitution.”

For now, Ms. Tymoshenko is struggling to close the gap with Mr. Yanukovich, a former prime minister who won the fraudulent election that set off the Orange Revolution and then lost the rematch. Once dismissed as a boorish Kremlin crony, he has undergone an image makeover of his own, positioning himself as more polished and independent of the Kremlin.

In the first round of the election last month, Mr. Yanukovich won by 10 percentage points. But no candidate received a majority, necessitating a runoff.

Mr. Yanukovich has focused on Ms. Tymoshenko’s role in the government, treating her as if she were the incumbent and asserting that voters should hold her responsible for Ukraine’s economic and political troubles.

Ms. Tymoshenko has ridiculed Mr. Yanukovich as a dimwitted pawn of Ukraine’s oligarchs. On Monday, he refused to take part in a debate against her. She appeared alone, calling him a coward. He later responded that she was a habitual liar.

In Ivano-Frankivsk on Tuesday, she mocked him for a verbal gaffe. He had told a crowd, “Gathered here is the best genocide in the country,” when he meant “gene pool.”

If Mr. Yanukovich were president, Ms. Tymoshenko said, he would be such an embarrassment that “who will agree to come to Ukraine to make investments, who will offer their hand to us?”

STILL, her visit here suggested the scope of her challenge. People at the theater, many of whom were educators, did not respond with notable enthusiasm, as if they had heard it all before. There were not many rounds of applause, and when someone tried to get the audience to chant her name, it petered out.

This in a region that is extremely unlikely to support Mr. Yanukovich, who is from eastern Ukraine.

Ms. Tymoshenko’s problem is that disaffected people here may not vote. To make matters worse, President Yushchenko, her former ally, is so angry with her that he is urging the public to cast ballots “against all” — a legal option.

In her speech, Ms. Tymoshenko assailed that advice. “Each of those votes is a vote for Yanukovich,” she said.

In the audience, a preschool teacher named Yelena Frezyuk, 30, listened intently but did not appear moved. She said she would vote for Ms. Tymoshenko very reluctantly because she was deeply disappointed in the Orange Revolution.

“There were a lot of promises, and very few carried out,” Ms. Frezyuk said.

But others said they adored Ms. Tymoshenko. Anna Yakimiv, 58, a university administrator, said, “We have hope only in her.”

But Ms. Yakimiv said she was nervous. “There is a great danger that Yulia will not make it,” she said.
1112 2010-02-06 Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he hoped the committee could begin marking up a bill later this month. “Ultimately this will be settled with amendments and votes, and we’ll move from there,” he said. “We’re just trapped in an endless discussion. You’ve got to stop the discussion and start voting.”

With their majority in the Senate reduced to 59 seats, one short of the margin needed to overcome Republican filibusters, the Democrats will have to secure at least some measure of support from across the aisle.

Republican lawmakers have said they favor passing some version of a regulatory bill. Both parties have been sensitive to public anger over the bailout of big financial institutions, the high unemployment rate and Wall Street bonuses.

Mr. Dodd and the top Republican on the committee, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, both left the door open for additional talks.

“Last night, Senator Shelby assured me that he is still committed to finding a consensus on financial reform, but for now we have reached an impasse,” Mr. Dodd said on Friday morning, hours before Congress ceased nearly all work because of an impending snowstorm.

Mr. Dodd added, “While I still hope that we will ultimately have a consensus package, it is time to move the process forward.” He said he had told his staff to begin drafting a bill that the committee could take up later this month.

Mr. Shelby stopped short of criticizing the Democrats on the committee, but said the plan for a consumer protection agency would interfere with sound banking regulation.

“I fully support enhancing both consumer protection and safety and soundness regulation,” Mr. Shelby said. “I will not support a bill that enhances one at the expense of the other, however. In order to strike the appropriate balance they must be integrated with each other, not separated from each other.”

President Obama put forward a package of regulatory changes last June, and the House passed a sweeping overhaul in December, largely along partisan lines.

The House bill would, among other things, create a council of regulators to oversee systemic risk, establish a process for dissolving large institutions without requiring government bailouts, give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay, strengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission’s power to protect investors, regulate over-the-counter derivatives and tighten rules for mortgage lenders and credit rating agencies.

Many, if not most, of those provisions have attracted bipartisan support.

But a proposal for a separate agency with power to issue regulations governing consumer financial products has emerged as the main sticking point. President Obama has expressed support for the notion, which is contained within the House bill.

Several people involved in the Dodd-Shelby negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of deference to Mr. Dodd, said the chairman had agreed in principle to concede a new agency in favor of a new consumer protection unit within an existing regulatory body. But these people said Mr. Dodd and Mr. Shelby could not agree on the degree of independence of that unit.

Since late last year, four pairs of Senate Banking Committee members — each with one Democrat and one Republican — have been meeting to address core elements of the package.

Along with the consumer protection agency, Mr. Shelby said that another unresolved issue was how to “craft a resolution regime that ensures taxpayers will never again bear the losses for risks taken in the private marketplace.” Senators Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who have been leading the talks on that issue, both said on Friday that they believed a compromise was within reach.

Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he believed that the proposal for a consumer protection agency could be potent for Democrats.

“What Chris has been doing is absolutely appropriate: he’s been conciliatory but not giving up on principle,” Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an interview, referring to Mr. Dodd. “The public reaction is not going to be favorable to blocking an independent consumer agency. The Republicans will be on the wrong side of this issue, not just substantively, in my judgment, but politically.”

Heather Booth, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of consumer, labor, civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations, said the impasse could actually help focus public attention.

“With health care having been the center of attention until now, people weren’t focused on the solution, because Congress hadn’t focused,” Ms. Booth said. “It’s becoming front and center now.”
1113 2010-02-06 Mr. Obama’s proposal is the latest in a string of initiatives intended to help small businesses. Last week, he proposed a one-year, $33 billion wage subsidy that would include a $5,000-a-worker tax credit for each new hire. This week, he called for using $30 billion from the federal bank bailout fund to create a small-business lending fund.

The latest plan, which like the others would need Congressional approval, has two components, both involving the Small Business Administration.

One would expand the agency’s 504 program, which guarantees loans for real estate development, to cover refinancings. The expansion could help refinance up to $18.7 billion a year in commercial real estate that might otherwise face foreclosure and liquidation, officials estimated.

The other would temporarily increase to $1 million, from $350,000, the maximum loan size under a program called S.B.A. Express that provides federally guaranteed financing through a streamlined approval process.

Earlier on Friday, the Fed and other regulators warned that small businesses were “experiencing difficulty in obtaining or renewing credit to support their operations” and said that banks might have responded to the downturn “by becoming overly cautious” in making loans to such companies.

The Fed has faced political pressure to spur lending. The joint statement came just two days after Ben S. Bernanke was sworn in to a second four-year term as the central bank’s chairman. He was reconfirmed by the Senate on Jan. 28 by the narrowest margin for a Fed chairman in the central bank’s 96-year history.

Days before that vote, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, had said he would support Mr. Bernanke, but only with reservations and after having urged the chairman to ease lending to small businesses.

In the statement, the regulators signaled that examiners of banks, savings and loans and credit unions had been instructed to look favorably on loans to small businesses that might otherwise seem risky.

Bank loans to small companies are primarily repaid through cash flow, and secondarily through underlying collateral. As collateral values have fallen, banks have been shy to make loans, fearing that if the loans go bad, examiners might force them to take steep markdowns, which could deplete the capital levels of the banks and further imperil their ability to lend.

The Fed also said that banks “should not automatically refuse credit to sound borrowers because of a borrower’s particular industry or geographic location.”

The statement expanded on two earlier statements: one in November 2008 that encouraged banks to make more credit available, and another last October that focused on modifications of commercial real estate loans.

Along with the Fed, the statement was issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.

Ernest T. Patrikis, a partner at White & Case and a former general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called the encouragement to lend overdue.

“This statement should have gone out earlier,” he said in an interview. “We shouldn’t have waited until now, when it’s no secret that small businesses aren’t getting credit.”

Camden R. Fine, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said that banks had been cautious because examiners “have become overly harsh.”

“When actual practices by federal bank examiners match the rhetoric of these interagency announcements, we may finally see progress in bank lending to small businesses,” he said, warning that “credit conditions will remain very tight” until then.

1116 2010-02-07 LOS ANGELES — The field did not finish the third round of the Northern Trust Open on Saturday at the soggy Riviera Country Club, but Steve Stricker did his best to ensure that the tournament was almost over.

By the time play was suspended by darkness at 5:34 p.m. with 12 of the 81 golfers who began the round left on the course, Stricker had put some daylight between himself and his nearest pursuers. He had four birdies in the 14 holes he completed, and he stood at 14 under par. That put him five strokes clear of the surging Luke Donald, who completed his round of 66 and finished at nine under par; J. B. Holmes, who birdied his last hole to finish with a 67 and drop to nine under par; and Andrés Romero, the Argentine who was nine under after a birdie and 13 pars through 14 holes.

Stricker, whose first stroke Sunday will be a 37-foot putt on the 15th hole, was in control of his game through the on-and-off rain that topped off a two-day deluge of more than three inches. He two-putted for birdie from 20 feet at the first, made a 15-footer for birdie at No. 6 and a 10-footer at No. 8, and hit a pitch to seven inches at No. 10.

“I was just trying to do my own thing and put blinders on and hit the shots I needed to hit and try to do what I’ve been doing the last two days,” said Stricker, who is ranked No. 3 in the world but can move up to No. 2 if he wins and No. 2-ranked Phil Mickelson — who was tied for 19th after a 71 — finishes lower than fifth.

“It was a good day,” Stricker said. “You know, it’s going to be a long day tomorrow. We’ve got to be out here at 7 in the morning and got to prepare myself for just a long day. It’s going to be tough.”

The second-round leader, Dustin Johnson — who finished out that round by holing a 45-foot birdie chip at the 18th hole that closed out a 67 for a one-stroke lead over Stricker at 11 under par — had a rough day. After a birdie at the first hole, he faltered at the third, where he hooked his drive and lost his ball in the high rough. He made a double-bogey there, bogeyed the fourth and ninth holes, birdied the 10th and bogeyed the 11th.
1117 2010-02-07 To many people who have never been to China, myself among them, San Francisco’s Chinatown — the oldest and one of the largest districts of its kind in North America — still largely represents Chinese culture, despite the popularity of films like Zhang Yimou’s “Hero”; international tours by the country’s top ballet, opera and circus companies; and the fame of Chinese composers like Tan Dun. Most Bay Area residents see beyond the usual representations of Chinese New Year parades, dragon dances and Ming Dynasty vases gathering dust behind glass in museums. But even so, when lipstick-colored pagodas, soggy dim sum and mass-produced, paw-waving porcelain cats come to represent an entire civilization, it’s time to take a step back and look beyond the Disneyland view.

For years organizations like the Chinese Culture Center and Chinese Historical Society of America have been working hard to change this image by demonstrating a sophisticated view of Chinese culture that challenges clichés and pushes us to think differently about the relationship between our two nations. And the conventional notions of Chinese culture will continue to be challenged as San Francisco begins Shanghai Celebration, a yearlong arts festival honoring the longstanding cultural connection between the two cities through concerts, films, exhibitions, discussions and other special events.

Inspired by the 30th anniversary of San Francisco’s sister-city relationship with Shanghai, as well as by the 2010 World Expo there, an event of this scope is a significant step forward.

Leading the effort is the exhibition “Shanghai: Art of the City,” opening on Friday at the Asian Art Museum. In contrast to that institution’s last major exhibition of Shanghai art in 1983, which focused strongly on traditional representations of Chinese heritage, the new show surveys the tension between the forces of outside influences and the push to stay loyal to Shanghai’s own visual culture. The work on display extends from 1850 (when Shanghai emerged as an international city as a result of clashes over trade between China and Britain) to the present day, and it reflects an artistic perspective that is at once intrinsically Chinese and more international in scope.

For instance, a bedroom suite from the 1920s demonstrates a strong European influence, with its Art Deco-inspired asymmetrical contours and use of bold geometric shapes. But the furniture reveals Chinese interests too: it is built out of a locally grown rosewood and inlaid with a typically Chinese bamboo design.
1118 2010-02-07 These financial issues and concerns about lagging test scores are expected to be raised Tuesday by officials of the Fremont schools at an Alameda County Board of Education meeting. Last month the board voted, 5 to 2, to give provisional approval for FAME’s operations to continue. By March, the school must show it has complied with the auditors’ recommendations before it can receive final approval.

In her own defense, Ms. Alaiwat said she was “one of the least-paid directors in the state” given the number of students and the size of the area FAME draws from. When she started the school, she said, she agreed to work for $88,000, “a lowered salary because it was my baby.”

“Money was not the motivation,” she said. “You make a lot of sacrifices.”

The school has received favorable attention for the welcome and resources it extends to Muslim families in this multiethnic region. On one of the FAME campuses, a converted J.C. Penney’s call center, no one stares when three slender girls slip away at lunch to kneel in a corner and pray. Arabic is taught in all grades, and many girls wear hijabs.

FAME is “a second home to many inner-city Muslim families,” Ms. Alaiwat said in an e-mail message. She added, “The wall separating church and state in public schools was barb wired on the Muslim side, making it impossible to have equal access to public services and making it emotionally ‘unsafe’ for many Muslim children.”

But scores on standardized state tests lag well below the average of the Fremont public school system in almost all subjects — a fact Ms. Alaiwat ascribed to the number of students who come from low-income families.

In recent interviews, Ms. Alaiwat blamed the efforts to shut FAME on Fremont Unified school officials, whom she called “old white men.” She said they had not come to terms with changes in Fremont, which is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the region.

“I personally believe they are racists,” she said. “I hate to pull the race and ethnicity card, but it’s so blatantly that. The fact we exist is haunting them.”

Larry Sweeney, a member of the Fremont Unified School Board, responded, “What a shameful, untruthful thing for an educational leader to say.”

FAME’s students would be better served in the public system, Mr. Sweeney said.

Dr. Milt Werner, superintendent of Fremont Unified School District, said his district provided “shining examples” of award-winning schools with mostly minority populations that were “closing the achievement gap.”

The FAME school has grown rapidly, as have the state payments provided in part on the basis of enrollment. The school has 1,490 students, coming from as far away as Richmond. Half are home-schooled. Ms. Alaiwat received bonuses for increasing enrollment and maintaining the financial stability of the school. Fast-growing charter schools often have financial gaps since their state revenue is based on the previous year’s enrollment.

In April 2009 the state’s “exceptional audit” of FAME Public Charter School made 42 recommendations. Jeff Stark, the Alameda County senior deputy district attorney, said he was “conducting a review of the audit and the underlying issues.”

Robert Chisholm, the president of FAME’s board, defended the payments to Ms. Alaiwat.

“They are not excessive for what she’s done,” Dr. Chisholm said, adding that the board gave her $75,000 for a car because “we thought she deserved it.”

The board also agreed to pay $958 in reimbursement for a speeding ticket. In its response to the auditors, the board agreed to stop paying such citations with school funds.

Jacki Fox Ruby, president of the Alameda County Board of Education, which granted FAME its charter, called Ms. Alaiwat’s compensation “outrageous.”

“What I don’t get is,” Ms. Ruby added, “if the teachers teach and the principals manage resources, what does the director do?”

The “extraordinary audit” issued in April was only the third requested by Superintendent Sheila Jordan in 10 years. A follow-up audit last fall indicated that more than half the 42 recommendations in the first audit had been carried out, and that progress was being made on the rest. One recommendation, asking that corrected W-2 forms for Ms. Alaiwat be filed, had not been resolved as of a follow-up audit in the fall.

Ms. Alaiwat, however, appeared confident when discussing the audit.

“Not a penny was legally mismanaged,” she said. “The audit did not result or yield any financial loss to taxpayers.”

The recommendations, she added, “are subjective best practices. Not the law. No criminal activity was found.”

Lara York, the president of the Fremont Unified School District’s board, said, “As a citizen, I have deep concerns over the amount of compensation the board is giving and the fact that they have not been elected.”

Ms. Alaiwat said these problems began after someone sent an anonymous complaint to the Alameda County superintendent of schools saying that she “was funneling money to terrorism.”

Not so, said Ms. Jordan, the superintendent, adding, “I never received an anonymous letter.” Complaints, she said, came from concerned citizens who wanted the school to continue.

In June 2008, Ms. Jordan requested that the state’s Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team investigate possibilities of fraud and misappropriation of money at FAME. That audit showed a new charter school that was scraping by from loan to loan as its population grew.

FAME’s response dismissed many of the auditors’ concerns, including those about Ms. Alaiwat’s renting an apartment to an employee. It said that she has a history of helping the homeless, the abused and orphans and was being charitable.

It also said that charter school officials were not obligated to abide by state conflict-of-interest laws cited in the audit.

FAME’s board now consolidates all of Ms. Alaiwat’s compensation into one lump sum.

In 2008, she received total compensation of $336,663. This year, her total pay will come to $240,000, Ms. Alaiwat said.
1119 2010-02-07 “The areas where we needed to do well, they gutted us,” Mr. Manion said of the opposition.

The party organizations “have been struggling with the decline of patronage,” he added. “That’s what made organizations strong. It’s a new world.”

Mr. Manion then recalled how in 1991, as director of field operations for Mayor Daley’s first re-election campaign, “we had 10,000 volunteers.”

“We were four and five deep in the precincts,” he said.

Until just a few years ago, the local political machine could still hum powerfully by promising plum spots on the public payroll to its most loyal and effective campaign workers. The courts had ruled that the rewarding of jobs to political insiders should not continue, but a federal corruption investigation revealed that the practice continued to thrive.

It all ended, however, after a midnight raid of Mayor Daley’s patronage office in April 2005. The next year, a federal jury convicted Robert Sorich, the mayoral patronage chief, and two other city officials of rigging hiring and promotions to increase the mayor’s power, and they were sentenced to federal prison. Mr. Sorich remains in prison in Yankton, S.D. — his release is scheduled for the day after this fall’s general election, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons.

While the federal case never led to charges against the mayor or his top aides, its impact on local politics was pervasive Tuesday. Even in races where the establishment’s candidates prevailed, outsiders came surprisingly close.

After Jesus Garcia crossed Mr. Daley 11 years ago, he was bounced from the state legislature by Hispanic patronage workers who answered to the mayor’s organization. On Tuesday, Mr. Garcia ousted Joseph Mario Moreno, the incumbent and a consummate party man, from his county board post.

Alderman Ricardo Munoz (22nd Ward) quarterbacked the campaigns of both Mr. Garcia and Rudy Lozano Jr., who was 565 votes shy of toppling State Representative Daniel J. Burke of Chicago, despite having a far smaller campaign war chest than the incumbent. Mr. Burke is the brother of Edward Burke, chairman of the City Council’s finance committee and Democratic boss of the city’s 14th ward.

“It’s an awakening,” Mr. Munoz said. “It’s the end of the caciquismo, the bossism.”

Mr. Lozano said that he had come up against the money and power of Michael J. Madigan, the Illinois House speaker, and he promised to challenge Daniel Burke again in the next election.

“Losing by a few hundred votes to the Madigans and Burkes is a political victory,” Mr. Lozano said.

Mr. Lozano has deep family ties to Chicago politics; his father helped Harold Washington become Chicago’s first black mayor in 1983.

Edward Burke could still brag that he handily delivered the precincts in his ward for his brother.

“In the 14th Ward, Dan carried with almost 72 percent of the vote,” Edward Burke said. “In the area where the Burkes are best known, we can still draw on the loyalty of voters.”

Beyond the Burkes’ political backyard, however, Mr. Lozano did well. “With the demise of patronage,” Edward Burke said, “the kind of political armies that used to be fielded have diminished.”

The Cook County Democratic Party’s fading potency was also evident further down the ballot. Edward Burke, a 40-year City Council veteran, is the chairman of the party’s committee for judges. Two of the party’s three picks for vacancies on the state appellate bench lost on Tuesday.

The true powerhouses of local politics today, Alderman Burke said, are unions that have the financial wherewithal as well as members who are willing to campaign door-to-door for labor’s favored candidates. Organized labor unseated several aldermen in the 2007 election, singling out Council members who had supported non-union Wal-Mart’s opening more stores in Chicago.

The Service Employees International Union spent at least $1.5 million to help Gov. Patrick J. Quinn win Tuesday’s primary. They also backed Ms. Preckwinkle as well as Mr. Garcia.

Another longtime beneficiary of that union’s largesse, Alderman Joe Moore (49th), bounced happily from one election-night party to another with his wife on Tuesday and into Wednesday morning. Accustomed to the lonely life of the rare mayoral critic on the Council, Mr. Moore was largely in the company of winners for that night.

First, he and his wife cheered Ms. Preckwinkle’s victory speech. From her party, they went to cheer David Hoffman, the United States Senate hopeful who made his reputation as the corruption-fighting city inspector general unafraid of confronting the mayor’s friends and family.

Although Mr. Moore was among the few elected officials who endorsed him, Mr. Hoffman finished a strong second to Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer. The vote breakdown shows that Mr. Hoffman won a plurality in many areas where party leaders endorsed Mr. Giannoulias.

The Moores’ evening ended at Governor Quinn’s packed party. The outcome of the Democratic primary for governor had still not been decided then, but the governor eventually claimed a narrow victory over Dan Hynes, the state comptroller and heir to a Southwest Side political dynasty.

“We’re witnessing the slow evolution of politics in this state,” Mr. Moore said at the end of his long night in hotel ballrooms.

He acknowledged that Ms. Preckwinkle and Mr. Quinn eventually had support from many of the local political powers. Ms. Preckwinkle had gratefully accepted help from friends of Mayor Daley, and Mr. Quinn held a news conference shortly before the primary with Joseph Berrios, chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party.

But Mr. Moore added that Ms. Preckwinkle and Mr. Quinn had built their careers outside the traditional path to power in Illinois.

“They went solo,” he said. “They did not rely on any political patron. They went over the heads of the establishment and went directly to the voters.”

In Ms. Preckwinkle’s case, power brokers like Mayor Daley’s allies only “jumped on her bandwagon when she looked like a winner,” Alderman Moore said.

Success stories like that, he predicted, will inspire others to seek political advancement on their own terms.

“Many have tried that over the years,” Mr. Moore said of the outsider candidates who now jockey for election. “Increasing numbers are succeeding, or coming close to succeeding.”
1120 2010-02-07 Wales fought back with tries by Adam Jones and James Hook. Straining to complete the comeback, it gave away a late interception try, finished by James Haskell, his second touchdown of the game. That settled the match.

Both countries had come into the game following awful runs against Southern Hemisphere teams last autumn.

For the first 35 minutes, both teams looked far-better coordinated and disciplined in defense. The errors crept in when they had to worry about catching and passing the ball, under pressure from seemingly impenetrable lines of defenders. Until Jones was sent off, the game was trench warfare interrupted by the occasional mortar of a long, hopeful boot forward.

“We tended to play too much around the halfway line on a wet and muddy day,” Johnson said

Often the 30 players were crammed together in the middle of the field. Long before the end, the grass was broken by two broad bands of mud on either side of the white center line.

When Jones tripped Jonny Wilkinson and earned a yellow card after 38 minutes, the teams were tied, 3-3. Wilkinson had kicked one penalty for England. Stephen Jones had kicked one for Wales. But Hook had missed with two longer penalty attempts for Wales. Those misses proved costly.

After the trip, Wilkinson picked himself up and booted the penalty to put England ahead.

Against 14 men, England then seized the initiative, and spent the last minutes of the first half trying to bash their way over the Welsh line. Deep in injury time, Haskell finally found the hole where Jones might have been, and thumped over.

Early in the second half, Danny Care, the England scrum half, faked a pass to his right, and, as an even bigger hole suddenly opened in the shorthanded Welsh defense, scampered right. He ran 20 meters untouched to score.

As Jones jogged back on, his time served, Wilkinson kicked the conversion to put England 17 points clear.

Wales fought back. Jones provided the pass which allowed Adam Jones, a hairy prop forward, to dive over the line.

Stephen Jones then misses a penalty. So when Hook beat four defenders with a combination of pneumatic stiff-arm jabs, fluid swerves and high-stepping power in the tackle, Wales still trailed by three points with nine minutes left.

“The momentum was going our way,” said Ryan Jones, the Wales captain. “We didn’t keep it going long enough.”

Desperate to create chances, Wales took risks. Stephen Jones threw a greedy pass. Delon Armitage, the England fullback intercepted. Slick inter-passing with Toby Flood and Mathew Tait stripped away the final wisps of Welsh defense leaving Haskell to cruise over the line escorted by two team-mates.

Wilkinson converted to take his tally to 15 points on a day when he was flawless, landing all six kicks at goal.

“We ultimately found a way to win,” Johnson said. “We’ve had both some tough losses and some tough wins. They turn on small things.”

In Dublin, Ireland started its defense of its title with a comfortable but not impressive victory at Croke Park that extended its unbeaten run to 12 test matches.

All the tries came in the first half, as Ireland built a 23-8 lead. Jamie Heaslip and Tomas O’Leary touched down for Ireland. Kaine Robertson replied for Italy, which lost all its games in 2009. The Irish were never threatening, or threatened, as the second half became a dour kicking contest

“Plenty to improve on but there’s no point in getting frustrated. It’s the first one. Job done,” Ireland’s captain, Brian O’Driscoll, told the news conference.
1121 2010-02-07 I take issue with your editorial suggesting that the Swiss government may not honor its agreement with the United States government regarding disclosure of certain UBS account records (“Is a Swiss Deal a Deal?,” Feb. 1).

Both the Swiss government and UBS have met all their obligations under their respective agreements with the United States, and there is no reason to expect they will stop.

It is true that a Swiss court recently ruled that a category of the 4,450 UBS client accounts could not be turned over to the United States. But all the parties, including the United States, contemplated that such a decision was possible and therefore provided for alternative mechanisms.

The recent Swiss government legislative initiative you mention is one such mechanism. As another alternative, the agreements also require that the Internal Revenue Service action be concluded once the I.R.S. receives disclosure of 10,000 UBS accounts, regardless of whether the information comes from the 4,450 UBS clients or elsewhere.

To determine whether the 10,000-account threshold has been met, those agreements explicitly require the I.R.S. to provide the number of UBS accounts disclosed through its voluntary compliance initiative, which has netted about 15,000 American taxpayers. Providing this essential information is an obligation that the United States has failed to meet.

You ask, “Is a Swiss Deal a Deal?” The answer is a strong “yes.” Perhaps you should next ask, “Is a U.S. Deal a Deal?” I hope the answer will be the same.
1122 2010-02-07 In the January sell-off, the big winners from last year, like emerging-market stocks and shares of blue-chip growth companies, tumbled the most. And the trouble in the markets began on the heels of several major policy announcements.

For starters, China’s central bank twice raised a benchmark short-term interest rate last month, aiming to slow the nation’s rapidly expanding economy and prevent the growth of a bubble in its financial markets. Although the rate increases were modest, they were widely seen as harbingers of a potential worldwide rate climb this year.

Investors had been banking on continuing stimulus plans throughout the year from governments around the globe, said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif. “But the question is A) how much more can governments do, and B) how much more should governments do?” he said.

The Obama administration announced plans last month for revamping banking regulations that, among other things, would rein in the size and growth of some financial institutions. The White House also signaled its intent, through its 2011 proposed budget, to let the Bush administration’s tax cuts for households earning more than $250,000 annually expire at the end of the year.

Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, noted that there have been fears about the markets’ reaction once the era of global stimulus ends. “The jittery market movements reflect this trepidation,” he said.

Could this be the start of a bigger sell-off? Quite possibly. Since the bull market began last March, the S.& P. 500 has not experienced a correction of at least 10 percent, even though pullbacks of that magnitude have historically occurred nearly once a year, according to Ned Davis Research, an investment-consulting firm in Venice, Fla.

But Mr. Paulsen says he does not believe that worries over shifting government policies will kill this bull.

“I don’t think this is enough to start a bear market,” he said. “I’d be much more concerned if the factors that caused the sell-off were caused by a drop off in the fundamentals.”

SO far, that has not been the case.

Indeed, around 80 percent of companies in the S.& P. 500 have beaten analysts’ consensus forecasts for profits in the fourth quarter, and more than two-thirds have exceeded expectations for revenue.

Some strategists say the market is overlooking this good news. “I was surprised that investors looked past pretty favorable economic and earnings data to focus on the Washington headlines,” said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.

But then again, Mr. Ablin said, he was not surprised by the recent pullback because “the market was — and probably still is — fairly to fully priced.”
1123 2010-02-07 Consider ScientificMatch.com, founded about two years ago, which aims to create romantic chemistry via genetic testing. The site, which matches people based on certain genetic markers for the immune system, takes its cue from studies showing that women are more attracted to the smell of men who have very different immune systems from their own. The site charges $1,995.95 for a lifetime membership — the lofty fee includes a cheek swabbing kit, DNA processing, a criminal and bankruptcy background check, as well as verification of age and marital status, the site says.

Then there’s Chemistry.com, started in 2006 by the dating giant Match.com. Helen Fisher, the biological anthropologist who developed Chemistry.com’s questionnaire, says the site is designed to predict compatibility based on traits of temperament like adventurousness, decisiveness or empathy. And it charges a premium for its services: about $50 for a one-month membership, compared with about $35 for Match.com.

But both ScientificMatch.com and Chemistry.com are refinements of an idea originally developed by eHarmony.com.

Founded in 2000 by a psychologist with experience in marriage counseling, eHarmony focuses on singles willing to invest time and to pay premium prices to find a long-term partner. People who register with the site fill out a long questionnaire that is intended to match people based on similarities in sociological variables like values, family background and social styles. Membership can cost up to $45.95 a month.

Online dating is a $976 million annual industry in the United States, according to estimates from Marketdata Enterprises, a research firm. So, to stand out among hundreds of mass-market, open-community sites that attract everyone from people trolling for quick hookups to those headed for holy matrimony, a few services offer more elaborate mate-finding methods.

They build brand identity when they “target people who are looking for relationships rather than just dating,” says John LaRosa, the research director at Marketdata Enterprises. That means matchmaking sites with fewer users can charge more per subscriber than larger sites that list online personals.

Match.com, with an estimated 1.2 million paid subscribers, had revenue of about $365 million in 2008, Mr. LaRosa estimates. EHarmony, meanwhile, with about 656,000 paid members, had estimated revenue of $216 million that year, he says. But do partner-prediction sites do better at matching people than less-structured dating sites where people seek, sort and select others on their own?

Success rates for online dating are hard to measure. But eHarmony says it clearly enhances the process by catering to people who are looking for relationships leading to marriage.

People tend to be adept at heeding that first spark of attraction but may be less dexterous at recognizing the commonalities that are the foundations of good marriages, says Gian Gonzaga, eHarmony’s senior director of research and development. The site suggests potential matches based on areas of compatibility —like values, beliefs and important experiences — that are predictors of relationship success, he says.

“In the long haul, you want to be able to manage conflicts, celebrate positives and get through the day-to-day relationship,” Dr. Gonzaga said. “Our system is there to take care of that so you can now focus on who you find really attractive, that you feel really passionate about.”

Chemistry.com, meanwhile, uses answers to a detailed questionnaire to suggest potential partners based on their brain chemistry, says Dr. Fisher, a research professor in the anthropology department at Rutgers University. Based on a review of scientific studies on neurotransmitters and chemicals like dopamine in the brain, she determined that humans tend to express one of four dominant temperaments.

Since the site’s introduction in 2006, more than eight million people have answered Dr. Fisher’s questionnaire, and she has used their answers to pinpoint traits that attract people to one another. She says people of decisive, straight-talking temperament, whom she calls “directors,” tend to be attracted to empathetic, intuitive types she calls “negotiators.” Spontaneous types (“explorers”) tend to be attracted to their own kind, while traditional pillars of society (“builders”) also tend to seek out partners that resemble themselves.

“If Helen Fisher can give you right off the bat individuals that your brain is more likely to be attracted to,” she says, “so much the better.”

At the end of the day, however, it may be that the success of such sites is attributable not so much to their proprietary methods as to their choosy, self-selected members who don’t want to wink at and woo the first person whose profile they read online. The sites attract cohorts of people interested in slowing down the online dating and mating process, in finding out more information about potential partners — or in ruling out unlikely suitors — before they graduate to the meet-and-greet stage.

THE more advanced the partner prediction sites, the more they may actually serve a more old-fashioned role. The sites provide background details on a person’s family, education, aspirations, character, genetic traits and general health of the type that was once public information in farming or immigrant communities or even in hunter-gatherer societies, Dr. Fisher says.

Indeed, at least from the point of view of evolutionary science, you’d be better off spending $50 — and more likely to find a mate — by using a premium dating site than by dropping $50 on drinks in the uncertain waters of singles bars.
1124 2010-02-07 Finance ministers from seven of the world’s biggest economies concluded a meeting in the Canadian Arctic on Saturday with pledges to maintain their fiscal stimulus programs, despite rising worries among investors about the mounting debts of some European governments.

“We are all absolutely committed to maintaining the support for our economies until we make sure that we have recovery established,” Alistair Darling, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, said in Iqaluit, Nunavut, where finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 nations were meeting.

The European debt crisis, and its spread from Greece to other countries in the euro zone like Portugal, Spain and Italy, were a focus of the two-day talks.

“The European authorities gave us a very comprehensive review of the program now in place to address the challenges faced by the Greek economy,” the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told reporters. He added that the officials had assured the group that they would manage the problem “with great care.”

Privately, American officials have said there is next to no chance that Greece will default on its debts. They said European officials were balancing a conviction that the International Monetary Fund should not be involved in solving Greece’s problems with their belief that political pressure was necessary for the Greek political leadership to cut spending and raise revenues.
1125 2010-02-07 This article is by James Kanter, Micheline Maynard and Hiroko Tabuchi.

Toyota’s recalls and disclosures in recent months are part of a lengthy pattern in which the automaker has often reacted slowly to safety concerns, in some instances making design changes without telling customers about problems with vehicles already on the road, an examination of its record shows.

Toyota received complaints from customers in Europe about sticking accelerator pedals as early as December 2008 and started installing redesigned pedals on new vehicles there last August. Months later, in January, similar concerns in the United States led to a pedal recall of 2.3 million vehicles. The European cars have now been recalled, too.

In a Congressional committee meeting on Jan. 27, Toyota officials said they first learned of this problem through reports of sticking pedals in vehicles in England and Ireland in the spring of 2009. But Toyota later acknowledged it had received reports there as early as December 2008.

Three years ago, it recalled 2007 and 2008 Toyota Camrys and Lexus ES 350s because the accelerator could stick under floor mats, a precursor to a much bigger recall last fall.

And in early 1996, Toyota engineers discovered that a crucial steering mechanism could fracture on the Hilux Surf, which was sold as the 4Runner in the United States. Toyota started installing a stronger version on new models.

Yet it took Toyota eight more years to start recalling Hilux Surfs and 4Runners built before the 1996 design change, after an accident involving an out-of-control Hilux Surf prompted a police investigation. Toyota received a rebuke from the Japanese government and was ordered to overhaul its recall system.

Many automakers address problems discreetly when feasible, hoping to avoid an uncomfortable spotlight.

But Toyota, a company that built its reputation with meticulous attention to quality, is now facing a credibility crisis as little-known problems are surfacing with many of its models.

Most recently, Toyota acknowledged it had identified a flaw in the antilock braking systems of its Prius hybrids and altered the system for models built since January. Facing new investigations, Toyota said it was considering a recall. Late Friday it began telling dealers that it would announce a fix early this week.

Toyota officials, when asked about their handling of previous safety issues, responded largely with comments about how they would handle the matter now and in the future.

“The company is prepared to cooperate fully and sincerely, and we are doing our utmost to deal with the matter in a way that brings safety and peace of mind to our customers,” the company’s chief executive, Akio Toyoda, said Friday at a news conference.

“We acknowledge that we could have communicated better as a company,” said James Wiseman, a spokesman for Toyota’s United States division. “However, we have taken significant steps to address these issues.”

Toyota’s handling of safety problems contrasts with steps Toyota took 30 years ago, when it was building its American operations.

Faced with engine and transmission problems on early Camrys, the company’s engineers addressed them, and by the mid-1980s, the Camry’s quality was considered on par with that of the Honda Accord.

After defects showed up on the first Lexuses in 1989, Toyota put together a team to solve them quickly. In many instances, the company went to customers’ homes to collect the cars.

Years later, many consumers started seeing evidence of a more reactive and defensive approach from the company.

In 2002, for example, Toyota faced thousands of complaints from customers who said their cars’ engines could become clogged with oil sludge.

Toyota initially faulted drivers, saying the problem was a result of infrequent oil changes. It agreed to extend warranties to eight years on 3.3 million 1997-to-2002 models. Customers then complained that Toyota made it too difficult to file claims, and the company was soon defending itself from a class-action suit.

Now the company is facing more public accusations of being slow to respond.

The transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, decided to confront Toyota late last year when it did not announce a recall for sticking pedals, although it had recalled millions of cars because their floor mats could interfere with the accelerator.

“Maybe they were a little ‘safety deaf’ in their North American office,” Mr. LaHood told The Associated Press last week.
1126 2010-02-07 By 2003, with both of Mr. Katz’s parents dead, little remained to tether the younger generation to the old neighborhood. One spring morning in 2007, when they were in Bath Beach checking out a house on Cropsey Avenue, Ms. Katz’s eye was caught by a ’60s-era split-level across the street. In its little rear garden, bright orange bushes were just starting to bud.

“That’s the one I want,” Ms. Katz announced to her husband.

Mr. Katz felt the same way: “Even outside, I said to myself, ‘We’re home.’ ”

The four-bedroom house fortunately was for sale, and the couple bought it for $820,000. Sandwiched snugly between two other houses, its backyard shadowed by a high-rise, it might not suit everyone. Yet it would be difficult to find a couple more enamored of the place where they live.

A main attraction was the downstairs unit that is now home to the couple’s son. Thanks to this arrangement, Nathan’s hundred-pound Staffordshire terrier, Diesel, can steer clear of Ginger, his parents’ beloved Yorkie, who clocks in at barely 10 pounds.

Another attraction was that the house, whose longtime owners were retiring to New Jersey, needed virtually nothing in the way of renovation. Nevertheless, its pristine condition did not prevent the couple from putting their stamp on the premises.

“It’s like appetite,” Mr. Katz said, using a simile that you suspect would sound even more vivid in his native Russian. “It grows when you eat.”

Over the next three years, the Katzes embarked on one project after another, among them redoing the hardwood floors and creating a space in the basement in which Ms. Katz, who is an aesthetician, can give facials to close friends and relatives. Next on their to-do list is the kitchen, where they prepare dishes like blintzes and pelmeni, and which stands as a reminder of the era in which coal-black appliances and countertops were the epitome of chic.

Of the many projects that the couple have undertaken, certain things immediately catch the eye.

One is the bedroom that has been converted into a vast walk-in closet. Mirrored cabinets from Ikea line the walls and are stuffed with dozens, perhaps hundreds, of shirts, sweaters and other garments. Many items still nestle in their original cellophane packages, never opened.

Where did this passion for haberdashery come from, you wonder.

“Well, you never have enough closets,” said Mr. Katz, who works for Selfhelp Community Services, a social services group, and volunteers at the Shore Parkway Jewish Center, a nearby synagogue.

And how many items are stored in this space?

“I have no idea,” Ms. Katz said. “We never counted.” Out of earshot of her husband, she added, “I think we’re afraid to count.

“When he was young,” she continued, “it was hard to get anything. He always dreamed of being a good dresser. Here in America, we could afford it.”

Another item that catches the eye is an Italian chess set that sits on a cabinet near the dining room table. The board of red-and-cream-colored wood rests on little feet, and the silver chess pieces, studded with red ceramic, bear distinctly Slavic features. The set comes from a store in Borough Park that sells silver Judaica. When his parents lived nearby, Mr. Katz used to pass the store. He found the handmade creation so alluring, he used to dream about it.

Ms. Katz, who bought the set as a present for her husband’s 57th birthday and the couple’s 25th wedding anniversary, whispered the price out of his hearing. “A thousand dollars.”

A third eye-catcher is the mammoth entertainment unit, which dominates the living room. Its centerpiece, a 42-inch television set, is topped with silver cups and candlesticks.

“All are from the old country,” Ms. Katz said. “The candelabra, which was in my husband’s family, survived after the war. But the parents didn’t have a single picture of the grandparents.”

The couple are also immensely fond of a colorful oil titled “Drunk in the Garden,” painted by a close friend named Frank Engel, who created a similar work for their bedroom.

Finally there is Ms. Katz’s bathroom, which she designed herself. The walls are sheathed in snowy Italian ceramic bearing images of nymphs and goddesses; the floor is aqua; and the Jacuzzi-style shower, with its battery of shower heads, looks like something the Jetsons would have admired.

Although the Katzes have put many aspects of their past behind them, their house is dotted with souvenirs of Mukachevo, including a picture of its city hall on the fridge and, on a kitchen wall, a plate showing the local fortress, with its red-tile roof. The images are a reminder of the couple’s roots, and of how far they have come.

“For immigrants to get something like this,” Ms. Katz said of the house, “it’s a dream come true. You love it like you love a person.”

Her husband expressed it another way: “It makes you believe that life is beautiful.”
1127 2010-02-07 In light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision to allow corporations to spend without limit in political campaigns, readers of Jennifer Schuessler’s entertaining essay on the literature of boredom (“Our Boredom, Ourselves,” Jan. 24) may enjoy learning that in 19th-century America, “boring” seems to have been the word for what we call “lobbying.” In 1852, for example, The United States Democratic Review berated William L. Marcy for, among other offenses, “boring the members of Congress for an increase of the duties of iron.” And in 1867, the biographer James Parton wrote that when the wife and son of Charles Goodyear, inventor of a way to vulcanize rubber, asked Congress to extend Goodyear’s patent, they were “denounced as ‘a powerful lobby, male and female,’ who, having despoiled the public of ‘20 millions,’ were boring Congress for 20 millions more.” This meaning doesn’t yet appear in the Oxford English Dictionary, though the O.E.D. does record the expression “to bore someone’s ears,” meaning to “insist upon a hearing,” from which it probably derived.

Maybe “professional readers . . . would rather not admit” that a book is boring, as Jennifer Schuessler asserts, but I find it altogether fitting that the O.E.D.’s first citation of the noun “boredom” comes from Dickens’s “Bleak House.” I confess: that novel is one of the greatest sources of boredom I have ever encountered. Despite the views Schuessler presents about the value of boredom, my boredom when carrying out the assigned task of reading “Bleak House” was good for neither my brain nor my soul. It was great for the manufacturer of NoDoz, though.

1128 2010-02-07 In simplest terms, electric drive motors use electricity from the vehicle’s battery to create the torque that drives the wheels. Every hybrid and E.V. has at least one electric machine, as engineers refer to the devices that often serve as drive motors and, when the regenerative braking is activated, as generators. Some vehicles have multiple motors, depending on their layout and sophistication.

With automakers preparing to introduce many new electrified vehicles in coming years, the demand for more efficient and powerful electric drive systems is growing. Annual production of e-motors designed to power vehicles is expected to grow well into the millions this decade, based on forecasts by analysts who track hybrid and E.V. production plans.

“We’re doing this for the same reason we make our own combustion engines — it’s core technology for us,” said G.M.’s vice chairman for global product operations, Tom Stephens.

Mr. Stephens said he believes electric traction motors, and the expertise needed to develop and make them, will eventually become as strategic and as ubiquitous as the gasoline V-8s he designed as a young engineer 40 years ago.

Many of his competitors agree.

Toyota, Honda, and Nissan also are treating electric-drive motors as fundamental technology they must closely control, said Toru Hatano, an analyst at CSM Worldwide who is based in Japan.

By keeping motor development and production inside the company rather than assigning it to a contractor, companies can better monitor quality and get a jump on new manufacturing processes. They can also more tightly manage their suppliers. According to Mr. Hatano, Toyota uses one of its affiliate companies, Toyota Tsusho, to keep it supplied with neodymium, a rare-earth metal critical for permanent-magnet motors.

JB Straubel, chief technology officer at Tesla Motors, said his company decided to develop and produce its own A.C. induction motor for the Roadster model rather than buy and modify a motor made by an outside vendor.

Development of motors requires big capital investments, Mr. Straubel said, but for Tesla it’s critical to what he called the “synergy of the electric powertrain,” or how the battery, e-motor, control electronics and charging system function as a unit.

“You start to have big inefficiencies if you buy a motor from a vendor,” he said.

Automakers that buy their motor know-how risk never being a technology leader in E.V.’s — just an assembler of cars, he said — and in the future, the top automotive brands will be known for their electric-drive expertise.

For some motor suppliers, the looming prospect of automakers doing their own electric drives has raised concerns. G.M.’s Baltimore announcement was “not a surprise, but upsetting nonetheless,” said Kevin Quinn, general manager of Remy Electric Motor Technologies.

Remy’s permanent-magnet e-motors are used in G.M., BMW and Mercedes hybrids as well as in commercial vehicles. The Indiana-based company, once part of G.M., has produced electric motors for a century. It was recently selected for a $60.2 million federal grant to accelerate hybrid and E.V. motor development.

Mr. Quinn is philosophical about his customers’ turning into potential competitors. He expects G.M. and other large automakers will ultimately shift only part of their e-motor development and production to their own facilities.

“We see this as a short-term trend,” he said. “The start-up E.V. makers and smaller auto companies don’t have the resources for motor R&D. The larger companies will discover how much of a head start we have in electromagnetic technology, manufacturing and patents.”

Mr. Quinn is confident that most hybrid and E.V. makers, including G.M., will continue to buy off-the-shelf motors, for which Remy will be expanding its production capacity next year.

BMW, a marque revered for the character and performance of its high-revving combustion engines, has not yet announced its e-motor plans. The company is weighing how it can transfer its sporting mojo into the electric-drive systems being developed for a new range of city E.V.’s, expected by 2015, and other products.

“We are being watched closely to see how we make electric vehicles that meet expectations of what BMW vehicles are famous for,” said Ulrich Kranz, director of the company’s Project I group, which is responsible for advanced vehicle planning.

Can an electric motor deliver the soul and panache of a BMW turbocharged in-line 6-cylinder, for example? “That’s part of our challenge,” Mr. Kranz said.
1129 2010-02-07 The fish arrived grilled, the better to show off its firm, steaky texture; the plantains and pomegranate lent alternately sweet and tangy flavors and the blistered beans a luscious smokiness. Another fish rarely seen on menus, the creamy wahoo, arrived on a friend’s plate lightly grilled and atop a mound of couscous that was spiked with harissa, a Moroccan hot sauce, and studded with Champagne grapes: sweet, spicy, subtle, explosive. It was one of the best seafood meals I’d ever had.

Later, Mr. Caswell explained that his ideas pull from Southeast Asian, Latin American and North African influences, representing some of Houston’s most food-centric ethnic communities. “I grew up here eating all these different foods. So I argue that I’m doing Houston food,” said Mr. Caswell, an alum of Jean-Georges in New York.

It’s tough for an ambitious Houston chef to make a go of it on seafood alone, and in late November, Mr. Caswell — fresh off the debut of the second branch of his hit sliders-and-wine joint, Little Bigs — opened a new restaurant, Stella Sola, in a brick town house in the trendy Heights district. Stella Sola merges the flavors of Tuscany and Texas, an idea that turns out not to be as bizarre as it sounds, with dishes like pappardelle with ricotta and an intensely meaty ragù of Texas wild boar, and, more directly, a charcuterie platter of Texan and Tuscan meats, cured in-house by the up-and-coming salumi star Justin Basye, formerly of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, in Westchester County, New York.

I visited Stella Sola once during its first few weeks of service, and the place was, predictably, slammed. A couple of dishes were perhaps sent out too hastily as the kitchen found its footing. That wild-boar pappardelle and a sautéed tripletail, a Gulf fish, with Asiago broth were both a bit over-salted, but the salumi plate was superb — the Tuscan-style lardo silky and lush, the smoked andouille and venison kielbasa spicy and assertive. And butternut squash ravioli, often an uninspired choice, was transcendent here: the delicate, creamy-sweet pouches showered with crushed pecans and amaretti cookies.

Bryan Caswell isn’t the only chef hankering to explore and remix the region’s food traditions, or to mark Houston as a city with a distinct sense of place. Still, it’s not always the easiest career path. Monica Pope, an owner of Beaver’s, which opened in 2007, and also the chef and co-owner of the six-year-old locavore restaurant T’Afia, is bent on getting Houstonians to recognize that eating well is not about eye-poppingly colorful supermarket produce, it’s about giving in to the idiosyncratic Texas growing climate and its peculiar surprises: strawberries in February, summer squash in November. (In the film “Urban Cowboy,” based in Houston and nearby Pasadena, the mother of the John Travolta character told him, “You just can’t get good vegetables in Houston.” You certainly can now.)

At Beaver’s, which sits on a quiet corner in the Sixth Ward, a historic area of mid-19th-century Victorian houses, Ms. Pope and her partners are riffing on a beloved but disappearing local institution: the ice house, where Houstonians who didn’t have in-home refrigeration once stopped by to pick up blocks of ice or just hang out over beer and jukebox tunes. The space, in a revamped ice house, features big booths and a central bar, and, keeping with ice-house tradition, picnic tables outside.

On a recent chilly afternoon, I grabbed an indoor booth. Though the barbecue — pulled pork, ribs — was lackluster, a seafood po’boy satisfied. Cornmeal-fried oysters and plump gulf shrimp were piled high on a soft French roll (which can also be ordered deep-fried) and layered with onions, slaw and a spicy tartar sauce. I hesitate to order po’boys outside New Orleans — why risk crushing disappointment? — but I’ll be back for this one.

A short drive from the Sixth Ward, the Houston native Scott Tycer stumbled into another city relic: an 1894 building in the Heights that once housed a burlap factory called the Oriental Textile Mill. In late 2008 it became Textile, where the tiny, 30-seat dining room plays up the space to stunning effect: vanilla-colored burlap panels hang above beautiful cast-iron industrial pieces, like an antique maintenance cart that’s now a wheelbarrow for serving petits fours.

It’s an impeccably styled, serene place to eat — perhaps a bit too serene: the esoteric offerings and tasting-menu format may be keeping less-adventurous diners away. (Mr. Tycer has added a short à la carte menu, and the tasting-menu dishes now can be ordered individually.)

The menus at Textile feature savory versions of bread puddings, tarts and strudels. During my recent visit, a hybrid of ratatouille and bread pudding, which the chef served alongside a juicy lamb ribeye, felt original, even if it didn’t win me over as much as three other glorious, bready concoctions: a powerfully rich bacon tart topped with a runny quail egg; a salad of bibb lettuce and Fourme D’Ambert blue cheese that came with a small, divine, house-pulled onion strudel; and a buttery, herby tarragon bread pudding wrapped in caramelized onion and paired with takali rasam, a South Asian soup tinged with cumin and the pungent spice asafetida. It’s probably safe to say that particular combination exists nowhere else.

In a more rough-and-tumble stretch of the Heights, Block 7 Wine Company, a wine bar and retail shop hybrid that opened in July in a former appliance warehouse, features a seasonal menu built around Texas ingredients. American classics are deftly infused with Euro spins: there’s a hefty “sloppy Giuseppe” — a satisfyingly oozy sandwich made with ground venison and wild boar confit on oniony challah — and one of the best burgers in town, a dry-aged-beef patty topped with arugula, Gruyère and a Dijon-spiked aioli.

Thanks to a friendly staff and smart design, Block 7’s huge, potentially impersonal room feels warm and relaxed. Works by local artists line the walls, and there’s a checkout counter made from a row of eclectic cabinets salvaged from the old appliance company. Because the space is part wine shop, customers pay retail for any bottle of wine they order from the wine list (or buy at the store).

On a recent visit, my dining companions and I downed burgers and that Italian-style sloppy Joe with a terrific Salice Salentino ($15) and a boutique Barbera ($40) from the shop. It was a rare, zero-markup, zero-corkage wine experience — and yet another sign that Houston’s restaurant scene has entered a bold new era.

1143 2010-02-08 HONG KONG — The police in central China have arrested three people and seized money and equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in a crackdown on the country’s biggest commercial operation to train computer hackers, state media reported Sunday and Monday.

But Western specialists in cybersecurity were skeptical that the arrests signified any broad commitment by China to halt the assaults on computer security that Google and other Western companies have endured in recent months.

China has not shut down the well-known servers that have been used in these attacks or arrested their operators, so the detention of the three people is unlikely to make much of a difference, said Ronald J. Deibert, a cybersecurity expert at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto.

“Their crackdown on this apparent hacker group needs to be placed in a broader context,” Mr. Deibert said. “I would characterize it as window dressing.”

1146 2010-02-08 For many of us, eating more whole grains requires learning about foods rarely seen in the traditional American diet.

Bulgur, a Middle Eastern staple made from durum wheat, is a case in point. Bulgur is made by boiling hard wheat berries until they are about to crack open, then allowing them to dry, at which point the outer bran layers are rubbed off and the grains are ground. The process of boiling the wheat berries dissolves some of the soluble vitamins and minerals in the outer bran layers of the seeds, but these nutrients are absorbed back into the endosperm of the grain during cooking.

Bulgur comes in one of four grades: fine (bags are often labeled #1), medium (#2), coarse (#3) and very coarse (#4). The different grinds are used for specific types of dishes. Pilafs are made with medium, coarse or very coarse bulgur. Tabbouleh and kibbe are made with fine bulgur.

This is a convenient grain to keep on hand in the pantry. It’s easy to find in whole foods stores and in Middle Eastern markets. Don’t confuse it with cracked wheat, which is another product made from raw wheat berries. Because bulgur is made from precooked wheat berries, it takes only about 20 minutes to reconstitute by soaking or by simmering. It has a wonderful nutty flavor and a light texture.

My colleague and Venice Cooking School partner Clifford A. Wright offers a wonderful recipe in our class on leafy greens. I’ve adapted his recipe, which includes more than one type of green, and layered the greens over bulgur for a robust one-dish meal.

1153 2010-02-08 Melvin Bullitt of the Colts, who watched the play from the sideline, said: “That was a huge turning point. They caught us off guard. It was gutsy. If we would have got it, the game might have been a blowout.”

At the time, the Colts were leading, 10-6. Jonathan Casillas of the Saints, who was on the kick coverage team, said Morstead “had this weird approach” to the ball that gave it backspin.

Morstead, who said he used to play soccer and liked to take free kicks, said that John Carney, a kicking consultant with the Saints, told him to “bend it like Beckham.”

The Colts’ Hank Baskett tried to corral the ball, as did Casillas and the Saints’ Chris Reis after it traveled the required 10 yards. Others joined the scramble near the sideline in front of the Saints’ bench.

“I saw Chris Reis recover it, and then it squirted between his legs and he got it back as the dogpile happened,” Morstead said.

Morstead said he ran into the pile and joined the battle, which lasted for about a minute with no official making a definitive signal.

“I heard a ref say, ‘Blue ball!’ ” Morstead said, and he feared that the officials would award the ball to the blue-clad Colts in excellent scoring position.

So Morstead began to pull Colts players off the pile, then felt a Colt pull him off amid grunts and groans and whistles. The officials eventually awarded the ball to the Saints at their 42-yard line.

Although the official record of the game listed Casillas as the one who recovered the ball, Casillas and several others said it was Reis.

“Me and Chris were fighting for it,” Casillas said. “And I saw a blue glove in there.”

Casillas said that the play was called Ambush and that the Saints had been working on it for two weeks and were pretty confident it was going to work.

“We were kind of saving it,” he said.

Six plays later, quarterback Drew Brees connected with Pierre Thomas for a 16-yard scoring pass as the Saints took a 13-10 lead.

Late in the first half, Payton could have ordered a field goal when his team was near the Colts’ end zone. But they got no points when Thomas was stopped on a run at the 1.

The Colts could have taken the ball downfield for 99 yards and a touchdown or at least for a field goal.

But because the Saints’ defense stopped them on three plays, the Saints’ offense had enough time, 35 seconds, to get the ball into field-goal range and pull them within 4 points at halftime.

Payton is not afraid to try tricks. In the previous game, the overtime victory over the Minnesota Vikings in the N.F.C. championship game, he called for a double reverse.

It almost lost 15 yards after the ball ended up in the hands of Reggie Bush, who seemed to be trapped deep in the backfield by Vikings tacklers as the play slowly developed. But Bush got it back near the line of scrimmage for only a one-yard loss after some nifty dodging.

After winning the championship, Payton talked about his decision-making.

“Well, we were going to be aggressive,” he said. “We’ve seen the onside kick all week and the guys executed it well. It turned out to be a big change of possession.”

Linebacker Scott Fujita, who was not involved in the play, joked that it went on so long that “I got in the scrum.”

Brees, who took advantage of the surprise possession, said, “Who would have thought to open the second half that we would do that?”
1154 2010-02-08 Allies of Mr. Ford, who was elected to Congress from Memphis in 1996 and served 10 years before moving to New York, contend that Ms. Gillibrand is seeking to deny him a spot on the ballot by wrapping up endorsements before he has decided to run.

“They are trying to shut him out,” said the chairman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, who has expressed enthusiasm for a Ford candidacy.

“She is going around day and night trying to close down party leaders sitting on the fence,” he said. “What is the purpose? To close out the opportunity for Ford to get on the ballot.”

Recalling an attempt several weeks ago by national Democrats including Senator Charles E. Schumer to discourage Mr. Ford from running, Tammy Sun, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ford, said Ms. Gillibrand had “already broken her promise not to use underhanded tactics to keep a potential opponent off the ballot, since that’s the way her insider friends in Washington and Albany always do it, but it is quite shameful.”

Jefrey Pollock, a campaign adviser to Ms. Gillibrand, said the senator had worked hard to earn the backing of 56 county leaders, and suggested that Mr. Ford, a vice chairman at Merrill Lynch, had himself to blame for a lack of party officials’ support.

“Harold Ford wants to have it both ways,” Mr. Pollock said. “The Wall Street executive constantly insults many New York Democrats with name calling and then wonders why these same Democratic leaders are not willing to just hand over their support to him.”

Mr. Pollock added: “While it may be hard for the Wall Street executive to understand, local activists and community organizers in New York are concerned about the economy and jobs, not Harold Ford’s personal political ambitions.”

Ms. Gillibrand’s supporters have made no secret of their desire to collect as many endorsements as possible before the convention. In conversations with several county chairmen in the past few weeks, Judy Rapfogel, the chief of staff to New York’s Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has conveyed his preference for Ms. Gillibrand over Mr. Ford, according to people told of the discussions. The county chairmen interpreted those talks as Mr. Silver’s encouraging them to back Ms. Gillibrand.

But several party officials said this was a routine strategy for an incumbent senator, and wondered whether Mr. Ford was trying to burnish his image as a political outsider.

If Mr. Ford has to embark on a petition drive, they said, it could help his candidacy by forcing him to build a network of campaign workers.

As the Manhattan Democratic Party closed in on an endorsement, Mr. Wright invited Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Ford to speak to its members. Ms. Gillibrand did so three weeks ago. Mr. Ford was invited to speak this week.

In his letter to Mr. Wright, Mr. Ford declined the invitation, saying it would be “inappropriate” to ask for an endorsement when he had not decided to run. He added: “Given that the New York State Democratic Party convention is not until May and that others — including me — are considering the race as well, this seems early to be holding an endorsement meeting.”

In a telephone interview Sunday night, Mr. Wright said: “We are not rushing this. We are going through our regular endorsement process.”
1155 2010-02-08 Ever since that decision, retailers say manufacturers have become increasingly aggressive with one tool in particular: forbidding retailers from advertising their products for anything less than a certain price.

For offline retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Best Buy, that means not dropping below those prices in the circulars and ads in newspapers. But online retailers have a greater burden. Manufacturers consider the product pages on sites like eBay and Amazon.com to be ads, and they complain whenever e-commerce sites set prices below the minimum price.

This leads the sites to replace prices with notes that say things like “To see our price, add this item to your cart.” One day last week, prices were missing on Amazon.com for an array of products like the Milwaukee Sub-Compact Driver drill kit, a Movado men’s Esperanza watch and an Onkyo 7.2-channel home theater receiver.

As a result, those prices also did not show up on search sites like Google Product Search and PriceGrabber.com. The trend has arguably weakened one of the implicit promises of e-commerce: that quick searches and visits to comparison shopping sites will yield the best deals.

Most online retailers complain that the missing prices confuse consumers and give an advantage to big chains like Wal-Mart, which do not bear the same burden in their stores. They also say the practice of enforcing minimum advertised prices has gradually spread from the consumer electronics business to companies in other industries like sporting goods and jewelry, which are also trying to stem the downward pressure of prices online.

Amazon declined to comment on the issue, but the company’s feelings on the matter are public. “Retailers like Amazon have the legal right to set their own prices independently, but some manufacturers place restrictions on how those prices may be communicated,” reads an explanation on Amazon product pages that lack prices. “We realize that this is an inconvenience and are regularly working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact our customers.”

A few online retailers, like Buy.com, say advertising restrictions have not measurably affected sales. But most other e-commerce companies volubly protest.

“We think consumers are best served when the retail marketplace is open and transparent and retailers have an opportunity to offer the best prices and services, and are not controlled from above by manufacturers,” said Brian Bieron, eBay’s senior director for domestic government relations.

Manufacturers, of course, have a different view. They say the competitiveness of the Internet has unlocked a race to the bottom — with everyone from large corporations to garage-based sellers ravenously discounting products, and even selling them at a loss, in an effort to capture market share and attention from search engines and comparison shopping sites. They also worry that their largest retail partners may be unwilling to match the online price cuts and could stop carrying their products altogether.

“If there isn’t that back-and-forth between manufacturer and retailer, it’s just a natural tendency to drive the price down to nothing,” said Wes Shepherd, chief of Channel Velocity, which sells software that allows companies to scour the Web looking for violations of pricing agreements.

Southern Audio Services, based in Baton Rouge, La., sets a suggested retail price of $80 for its Woodees Inner-Ear Stereo Earphones, while their minimum advertised price is $50. Most online retailers sell them for around $50, but Amazon sells them for $48.40, keeping the price off the product page.

“At the end of the day, it will become a race to zero if you don’t do anything to manage the issue,” said Jon C. Jordan, chief executive of Southern Audio Services. “Then you’ve devalued your product to the point where it’s difficult to get distribution and consumers lose interest in it.”

The battle may shift back to Washington. Companies like eBay and Amazon are asking Congress to override aspects of the Leegin ruling. One bill that would repeal provisions of the ruling is now being considered in the House. In October, 41 state attorneys general wrote a letter to members of the House Judiciary Committee, arguing that the court’s decision had resulted in higher prices for shoppers.

Just like other product makers, book publishers have also been emboldened by the Leegin decision. In their case, they want to prevent low prices on electronic books from cannibalizing their more profitable hardcover sales.

Instead of selling e-books wholesale to retailers like Amazon.com, the publishers want to sell them directly, setting prices and having the retailer act as an agent, taking a fixed 30 percent commission. Macmillan recently struck such an agreement with Amazon.com after a protracted dispute that led Amazon to remove, briefly, Macmillan’s electronic and physical books from its site. Deals with the other major publishers will most likely follow.

Book publishers “are using a different set of levers, and a different vocabulary, to get what they want,” said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, which helps companies sell online. “But it’s the same outcome. Manufacturers are effectively controlling the price that the consumer sees on the Web.”
1156 2010-02-08 RAEFORD, N.C.  Precious Holt, a 12th grader with dangly earrings and a SpongeBob pillow, climbs on the yellow school bus and promptly falls asleep for the hour-plus ride to Sandhills Community College.

When the bus arrives, she checks in with a guidance counselor and heads off to a day of college classes, blending with older classmates until 4 p.m., when she and the other seniors from SandHoke Early College High School gather for the ride home.

There is a payoff for the long bus rides: The 48 SandHoke seniors are in a fast-track program that allows them to earn their high-school diploma and up to two years of college credit in five years  completely free.

Until recently, most programs like this were aimed at affluent, overachieving students  a way to keep them challenged and give them a head start on college work. But the goal is quite different at SandHoke, which enrolls only students whose parents do not have college degrees.

Here, and at North Carolina’s other 70 early-college schools, the goal is to keep at-risk students in school by eliminating the divide between high school and college.

“We don’t want the kids who will do well if you drop them in Timbuktu,” said Lakisha Rice, the principal. “We want the ones who need our kind of small setting.”

Results have been impressive. Not all students at North Carolina’s early-college high schools earn two full years of college credit before they graduate  but few drop out.

“Last year, half our early-college high schools had zero dropouts, and that’s just unprecedented for North Carolina, where only 62 percent of our high school students graduate after four years,” said Tony Habit, president of the North Carolina New Schools Project, the nonprofit group spearheading the state’s high school reform.

In addition, North Carolina’s early-college high school students are getting slightly better grades in their college courses than their older classmates.

While North Carolina leads the way in early-college high schools, the model is spreading in California, New York, Texas and elsewhere, where such schools are seen as a promising approach to reducing the high school dropout rate and increasing the share of degree holders  two major goals of the Obama administration.

More than 200 of the schools are part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Early College High School Initiative, and dozens of others, scattered throughout the nation, have sprung up as projects of individual school districts.

“As a nation, we just can’t afford to have students spending four years or more getting through high school, when we all know senior year is a waste,” said Hilary Pennington of the Gates Foundation, “then having this swirl between high school and college, when a lot more students get lost, then a two-year degree that takes three or four years, if the student ever completes it at all.”

Most of the early college high schools are on college campuses, but some stand alone. Some are four years, some five. Most serve a low-income student body that is largely black or Latino. But all are small, and all offer free college credits as part of the high school program.

“In 27 years as a college president, this is just about the most exciting thing I’ve been involved in,” said John R. Dempsey, the president of Sandhills. “We picked these kids out of eighth grade, kids who were academically representative at a school with very low performance. We didn’t cherry-pick them. Their performance has been so startling that you see what high expectations can do.”

Initially, the prospect of two years of college at no cost was less appealing to Ms. Holt than to her mother, Simone Dean, an Army mechanic at nearby Fort Bragg.

“I didn’t want to do it, because my middle school friends weren’t applying,” Ms. Holt said. “I cried, but my mother made me do it.

“The first year, I didn’t like it, because my friends at the regular high school were having pep rallies and actual fun, while I had all this homework. But when I look back at my middle school friends, I see how many of them got pregnant or do drugs or dropped out. And now I’m excited, because I’m a year ahead.”
1157 2010-02-08 The Argentine composer Ginastera made an unlikely appearance in Donizetti’s “Fille du Régiment” when Laurent Pelly’s lively and broadly comical 2008 production returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday evening.

The Duchess of Krakenthorp is usually a spoken part. But a mere cameo role with a few lines would have been a miserly way for Kiri Te Kanawa, now 65, to make what may be her farewell to the house, where she has not sung in an opera since 1998. She told British news media that she plans to retire from the opera stage in April after singing the Marschallin in Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier” in Cologne.

The role was beefed up for Ms. Te Kanawa with extra dialogue, including lines like “Sweetheart, don’t be stingy with the Dom Pérignon.” She entered at the beginning of Act II and sang the tune of the orchestral prelude, then a sultry rendition of Ginastera’s “Canción al Arbol del Olvido” (“Song of the Tree of Forgetting”).

The other news in Saturday’s performance, deftly and elegantly conducted by Marco Armiliato, was the soprano Diana Damrau’s vocally and theatrically stellar house role debut as Marie, the orphan raised by a Tyrolean regiment. She achieved the impressive feat of giving Natalie Dessay, who originated the role in this production, a run for her money.

Ms. Damrau sang fluidly and expressively, conquering the coloratura hurdles while enacting Mr. Pelly’s athletic staging, set in the first act against a backdrop of enormous maps. She sometimes seemed to be hamming it up too much, but for the most part offered an ideal balance between the impishly melodramatic tomboy, sulking and flirting, and the love-struck girl removed from her regimental family.

There was plenty of chemistry between Marie and Tonio, her love. Reprising that role Juan Diego Flórez again demonstrated his boyish charm and ardent tenor, easily nailing the nine high C’s of “Pour mon âme.” He received lusty applause, but fans on Saturday hoping for an encore of the aria (which he offered in 2008) were disappointed. He sang with tender emotion in “Pour me rapprocher de Marie.”

Maurizio Muraro sang with a booming bass baritone and affable presence as Sulpice, a sergeant and one of Marie’s regimental “fathers.” As the imperious Marquise of Berkenfield, who hopes to turn Marie into a proper lady, Meredith Arwady performed the role with comic flair, aided by Hortensius, her overbearing butler, ably sung by Donald Maxwell.
1158 2010-02-08 As the dark comedy “Duet for Solo Voice” begins, Leonard Pelican, its only character, recounts his personal chronology: published a novel at 24, married a chorus girl at 26, entered a mental institution “for the first time” at 30. Now, years later, he’s the night manager of the quintessential seedy Times Square hotel in 1969.

Between phone calls to his wife, his agent and the police precinct, we learn that Pelican is cracking up again. Not only does he believe he is the target of a murderous Soviet agent of his own invention, Vassily Chort, but he also becomes him, equipped with thick accent, black trench coat and revolver. On this particular shift, Pelican’s two halves collide.

“Duet for Solo Voice,” at the Theater for the New City, presents Pelican’s paranoia as desperately humorous. And at a time when one-actor shows have largely come to mean stand-up memoirs, it’s a relief to find one-character plays — behavioral studies with plot, motivation and monologues, the brick and mortar of theater — still being staged.

This one comes with a pedigree. Written by David Scott Milton, the play was first performed in 1970 and taken to Broadway in 1975 (slightly revised and retitled “Duet”) as a vehicle for Ben Gazzara, paired with another short work, “Hughie,” by Eugene O’Neill. Though the double bill ran for only a month, Mr. Gazzara’s performance in both was strong enough to earn him a Tony Award nomination.

The current version, which stars Jonathan Slaff, makes adjustments of its own. The director, Stanley Allan Sherman, has turned the hotel into more of a presence, with offstage actors providing the sound effects of an energetic couple in Room 204, and one unexpected appearance. This provides some incidental humor, all the more appreciated because the play itself is a bit patchy.

It aspires to the farcical heights of “Diary of a Madman.” (At one point Pelican tells his agent his new book is “in the style of Gogol.”) But insanity played for laughs is not easy to pull off. Pelican’s agitation feels forced and is only occasionally amusing; there is little to connect with. Most of the humor comes from his one-sided phone conversations, and most of those jokes fall flat.

1181 2010-02-09 “We are proud and satisfied with our numbers in the first season of crisis,” Seifert said. “Who would have thought that record numbers are possible? We have combined relative financial health with good performance on the pitch. We believe it shows how good the Bundesliga business model is.

“Our three revenue streams — TV revenue, sponsorships and gate receipts — have more stability. In Italy, the clubs receive very little from match receipts, so you have to decide if you want sporting success while you ignore any financial circumstances. We are trying to do both in the Bundesliga.”

German clubs in the top two divisions enjoy solid support at home, but Bundesliga clubs, which once were a force in European competitions, have not played in a Champions League final since 2002, when Bayer Leverkusen lost to Real Madrid. They hold preseason (and midseason) training camps close to home, even though league games are available worldwide on TV.

“Yes, sometimes perhaps you could say that in Germany, the international perspective is still not so much in the mind of the clubs,” Seifert said. “But for about 10 years now, each club has been required to have what we call academies, but you may call academies. There have been 5,000 players through these programs, and for the first time in European history, Germany had the European champion in under-17, 19 and 21.

For producing players, these camps are 20 million euros cheaper than buying a Ronaldo. What’s better? One superstar or building up academies to produce the superstars of the future?”

According to the annual report, the 36 clubs that comprise the top two divisions in Germany spent a combined $107 million on their academies in 2008-9.

Several years ago, Major League Soccer and the Bundesliga signed a strategic agreement that has yet to provide many tangible results: no German clubs have played exhibitions in the United States during the summer, for example.

“Our cooperation with M.L.S. is an exchange of know-how,” Seifert said. “The U.S. is very interesting, and we have a lot to learn in terms of the media landscape. On the other hand, M.L.S. people have been over to watch our ref system and the academies.”

Seifert was excited about attending his first Super Bowl, “one of the greatest sports events in the world,” but he was quick to point out that from “a global perspective, it can’t compare with the World Cup final.”

1182 2010-02-09 Coach Sean Payton made daring decisions on the way to New Orleans’s first Super Bowl victory. Toward the end of the first half on Sunday night, trailing by 10-3, he called for a run on fourth-and-goal from the 1.

He later opted for an onside kick to open the second half, perhaps the game’s most aggressive call. And after his team scored the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter, he called for the 2-point conversion. Let’s take a look at all three decisions. Daring, yes; but did he have the numbers on his side?

There are different approaches to analyzing whether Payton made the right call on fourth down. One way is straightforward — will the Saints score? By this measure, it was an easy call. Historical analysis shows a team should go for it on fourth-and-goal from anywhere inside the 6.

But another way to analyze the call is to determine how much it will help a team win, or a statistic called Win Probability. Win Probability is an in-game estimate of a team’s chances of victory derived from the score and other game variables based on regular-season statistics from the past decade.

With a little less than two minutes to go in the half and a fourth-and-goal on the 1 and the Saints trailing, 10-3, the Win Probability analysis agrees with the go-for-it call. A field goal gives the Saints a 0.32 Win Probability. A touchdown ties the score and gives the Saints a 0.48 Win Probability. A failed attempt gives the Colts a first down at their 1 with 1 minute 55 seconds to play in the half and drops the Saints’ Win Probability to 0.26. It was certainly a high-stakes play. Fourth-and-goal from the 1 plays are converted 68 percent of the time. This makes the overall decision to go for it worth a 0.41 Win Probability:

Going for the touchdown was the better call, 0.41 versus 0.32 Win Probability.

Onside kicks are more successful when they are not expected. Since 2000, slightly more than 60 percent of unexpected onside kicks have been recovered by the kicking team.

In this case, the Saints were behind by 4. A deep kick would typically give the Colts a first-and-10 near their own 30, translating to a 0.32 Win Probability for the Saints. A failed onside kick gives the Colts a first down at the Saints’ 40 or so, worth a 0.26 Win Probability to the Saints. A successful recovery gives the Saints possession at their own 40, giving them a 0.39 Win Probability. In total, the onside attempt is worth a 0.34 Win Probability:

The onside attempt was a good gamble according to the numbers, but not by much — 0.34 versus 0.32 Win Probability.
1183 2010-02-09 “We do not have anything to hide,” Tim Gayda, the Vancouver Organizing Committee’s vice president for sport, said at a news conference Sunday. Reporters and photographers will be allowed to visit the location on Tuesday.

Before heading to Cypress, members of the United States mogul team played down the possibility that their altered training schedule and the soggy snow conditions would affect their performances.

“We’ve been in conditions like this before,” Michelle Roark said. “In Italy, we were on a dirt hill that was dirt on both sides of us and a run in the middle.”

Spokesmen for the organizing committee, known as Vanoc, said that officials involved in preparing the site were too busy to discuss their operations.

The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, reported that corrugated steel pipes had been placed under the snow on the moguls and aerials runs. The pipes are filled with dry ice to freeze the imported snow from underneath.

Earlier, organizers said that they might apply a chemical known as urea to dry out the snow. While approved by the government, the use of urea is questioned by some environmentalists.

Training on the snowboard halfpipe was canceled on the weekend. Athletes will now have only three days of training on the halfpipe rather than the five they were promised. Parallel giant slalom training days have also been cut back, and free skiing and boarding sessions were relocated to Whistler.

Some teams, however, are not planning to send athletes to Whistler, which is about a two-hour bus ride from the athletes’ village in downtown Vancouver.

ROGGE WARNS RUSSIA Jacques Rogge urged Russia to be tougher on drug cheats, voicing his concern at the high number of doping cases among Russian biathletes and cross-country skiers.

Four days before the start of the Vancouver Games, Rogge said he raised the matter in recent meetings with President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia and sports officials in the country.

Rogge said that it was up to the World Anti-Doping Agency to monitor Russia’s record and compliance with drug rules and that Olympic officials expected Russia to comply.

Three top Russian biathletes, including the five-time Olympic medalist Albina Akhatova and the former world champion Yekaterina Iourieva, received two-year suspensions last year after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO.

Four Russian cross-country skiers were barred for two years for using EPO, and another cross-country skier was dropped from Russia’s team for the Vancouver Games last month for the same offense. (AP)

1184 2010-02-09 WASHINGTON — Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, on Monday night lifted most of the nearly 70 holds he had placed on President Obama’s nominations to posts that require Senate confirmation.

Last week, Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, called the holds another example of the corrupt nature behind lawmakers’ earmarks for pet projects.

In a statement, Mr. Shelby’s spokesman, Jonathan Graffeo, disputed that characterization. The holds, he said, were “to get the White House’s attention on two issues that are critical to our national security,” a refueling tanker that would add jobs in Mobile and an F.B.I. antiterrorism center to be built in Alabama.

Mr. Shelby still has holds on three nominees whose jobs would be related to the tanker project. They are Terry A. Yonkers, nominated for assistant secretary of the Air Force; Frank Kendall III, for principal deputy under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics; and Erin C. Conaton, for under secretary of the Air Force.
1185 2010-02-09 Recent articles (front page, Jan. 24 and Jan. 27) and letters (Jan. 31) have addressed the abuses of radiation in connection with medical treatment. While the risks of radiation are less than those of texting and driving a car, they are very real — but very controllable.

One hundred United States civilian nuclear power plants have been operated for 25 years, and more than 100 Navy nuclear reactors have operated for decades, all without a single fatality.

Radiation has inherent risks, but we know what they are and how to control them. Perhaps the medical industry needs to institute the same controls that other users of radiation have used so successfully.

1186 2010-02-09 Still bruised by his presidential run and struggling to find his footing in the fractured , Mr. McCain remains a formidable force in his home state, through the sheer power of his name and fat campaign coffers. Most political analysts suggest that Mr. Hayworth begins as the underdog, and Mr. McCain’s supporters say they are confident.

“Senator McCain takes every race seriously,” said Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the senator’s re-election campaign, “and is confident that the voters of Arizona will again return him to office as they have done in the past, and he is working hard to earn their continued support.”

Yet Mr. McCain now finds himself jammed, moving starkly — and often awkwardly — to the right, apparently in an effort to gain favor among the same voters whom Mr. Hayworth, a consistent voice for the far right, could pull toward him like taffy come summer.

Mr. McCain now sharply criticizes the bailout bill he voted for, pivoted from his earlier position that the detention facility should be closed, offered only a muted response to the ’s decision undoing campaign finance laws and backed down from statements that gays in the military would be O.K. by him if the military brass were on board.

“John is undergoing a campaign conversion,” Mr. Hayworth said.

Mr. Hayworth’s radio-personality bluster and big emotions — he teared up in an interview when describing the film — were once the stuff of eye rolls, but may now have a part in the greater populist narrative that threatens many of the nation’s more centrist Republicans.

Mr. McCain, a tireless campaigner since he was first elected to the Senate in 1986, is taking nothing for granted. He has clocked many hours doing town hall meetings and other campaign events and has already run three radio advertisements in .

His campaign, concerned that Mr. Hayworth was taking an unfair — and possibly illegal — advantage of his position as a talk show host on the right-leaning radio station KFYI (550 AM), filed a complaint against him with the ; Mr. Hayworth quickly resigned from his spot, bringing an end to such orations as “get ready for amnesty” after the earthquake in Haiti.

Mr. McCain has been long vexed by the more right-leaning corners of the Republican Party, especially the ones here at home, who are forever straw-polling their way toward his (fictional) downfall. His support for policy overhaul, campaign finance restrictions and his past opposition to the Bush administration cuts and the Federal Marriage Amendment all contributed to his problems here.

In 2008, signs of Mr. McCain’s weaknesses at home were revealed. He won 47.2 percent of the vote in the Republican presidential primary, a clear victory but hardly overwhelming for a hometown guy.

“J. D. is our great hope,” said Rob Haney, chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Party, home to Phoenix, and Mr. McCain. “McCain has been a thorn in our sides for years. A dagger in our backs, really.”

Mr. McCain and Mr. Hayworth are not lifetime adversaries. During Mr. McCain’s presidential run in 2000, Mr. Hayworth campaigned for him aggressively. But the two parted ideological ways shortly after that election, and Mr. Hayworth has been dinging him ever since.

But on balance, Mr. McCain has enjoyed a deep base among the state’s more centrist Republicans, independents and Democrats, and his fund-raising abilities — he has roughly $5 million in the bank for this race — and greater institutional support statewide have been unbeatable.

Even within the fractured Tea Party movement, Mr. McCain is not without support. He is endorsed by Senator of , the populist movement’s darling, and , his running mate in the 2008 presidential campaign. And , whose FreedomWorks organization has become front and center in the movement, says he is throwing his support behind Mr. McCain.

Further, many Arizona Republicans are not eager to offer any hope in the general election to the Democrats, who so far have no challenger for the Senate seat but might become animated by the possibility of Mr. Hayworth to smack around.

Indeed Mr. Hayworth, a former sportscaster who rode the 1994 wave of conservatism into Congress, where he then served six terms, has political baggage. He was a very large recipient of both money and largess — like sports skyboxes — from the disgraced lobbyist . His loss to Harry E. Mitchell, a Democrat, in his 2006 re-election bid was humiliating, and underscored voter distaste for some of his more boisterous ways.

In interviews with roughly 20 Republican voters in and the conservative city of Gilbert, not a Hayworth supporter could be found. “I think McCain’s doing a yeoman’s job, and I’ll vote for him as long as he runs,” said Jerry Ebner, 59, a computer consultant in Scottsdale.

However, even at this early juncture, the Arizona primary is shaping up to be among the more high-profile Republican races nationally.

“Arizona Republicans are more energized than they have been in recent memory,” said Matt Roberts, a spokesman for the state’s Republican Party. “That energy between the two candidates will push turnout, and I think it will be a pretty dynamic for both of them.”

Ever eager to sprinkle beads of approbation for the storied man he hopes to bring down, Mr. Hayworth couched his confidence in compliments. “We all admire and respect John for his service,” he said. “But he’s been there too long, and it’s time to welcome him back home.”
1187 2010-02-09 Its buyers included Merrill Lynch, Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and, yes, some of HCA’s own managers. Collectively, the group put down $5.5 billion in cash — the rest was a giant loan from a syndicate of banks.

So when HCA says it will pay a dividend to its shareholders, what it really means is that its shareholders — the private equity firms that control the board — have decided to pay themselves.

That might be a reasonable thing to do in a bull market with a highly profitable company that has little debt. But just look at HCA’s balance sheet: it has a staggering $25.7 billion worth of debt that it still needs to pay off.

As Vicki Bryan, an analyst at Gimme Credit, wrote in a report to clients, HCA’s $1.75 billion dividend payment last week “completely offsets the comparatively meager $1.6 billion in debt paid off in 2008-2009.”

Worse, Ms. Bryan noted, “most of that debt reduction was funded not from HCA’s chronically weak free cash flow but by $1.6 billion in asset sales.” Not one to mince words, she titled her report “Shell Game.”

Back in 2007, if you’ll recall, private equity firms, buoyed by a peaking market, routinely paid themselves huge dividends. They would often take out new loans to write themselves giant checks, just like homeowners took out second mortgages to buy flat-screen TVs and boats.

So when the economy turned against them, the companies owned by private equity firms found themselves with little cushion and were forced to resort to layoffs and to cut back on research and development; some were forced to file for bankruptcy, like the Simmons Company, which makes bedding.

Now, the dividend is officially back, though none as large as HCA’s. Vanguard Health Systems recently paid out $300 million to the Blackstone Group, for example, and Quintiles Transnational paid $275 million to a large consortium that includes Bain and TPG, among others.

Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with paying dividends to shareholders. Public companies do it routinely. But highly leveraged companies face bigger risks.

In fairness to HCA and its investors, they say there are signs the hospital business is improving. HCA’s revenue is expected to increase to $30 billion for 2009, from $28.4 billion in 2008; and net income is projected to rise to $1 billion, compared with $673 million for 2008.

And HCA’s leverage ratio has gone down, not up — from 6.4 times to 5. (Then again, if HCA had used the $1.75 billion to pay down debt instead of its shareholders, the leverage ratio would have dropped to 4.7.)

“The distribution balances a return to stockholders with maintenance of a strong balance sheet,” a spokesman for HCA said. “This is the first time since we went private in 2006 that we’ve provided a return to stockholders who invested in HCA at that time.” The spokesman also said 1,600 HCA employees would receive part of the dividend.

Frank G. Morgan, an analyst at RBC, said the dividend reflected HCA’s position of strength.

“As the largest hospital operator in the U.S. with 163 acute-care facilities located in 20 states, HCA represents a bellwether for the for-profit hospital industry,” said Mr. Morgan, suggesting that HCA’s announcement was a “positive early data point for the industry.”

It also is true that HCA’s investors still have skin in the game — they will be taking out less than a third of their investment in the company, so arguably they have every incentive to want it to succeed.

Nonetheless, the half-dozen investors and analysts I informally polled about HCA’s dividend questioned the rationale of the payment amid an uncertain economy. None of them wanted to be quoted by name. So the microphone goes again to Ms. Bryan of Gimme Credit.

“We long have been wary of the quality of HCA’s revenue and Ebitda,” Ms. Bryan said, using the shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, “and now the payout of a fat dividend has slashed the odds that HCA will launch an I.P.O. anytime soon. We also expect further pressure in 2010 as pricing fades for hospital operators and cost inflation outpaces revenue growth.”

For the sake of the hospitals, let’s hope she’s wrong.
1188 2010-02-09 A former executive of Intel admitted in court on Monday that he had leaked confidential corporate information to his close friend Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund. He adds to a list of cooperating witnesses that federal prosecutors are using to build a case in a wide-ranging insider-trading scandal.

The executive, Rajiv Goel, said at a court hearing that his friendship with Mr. Rajaratnam began 25 years ago when the two attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Goel said he provided Mr. Rajaratnam in 2007 with inside information about Intel’s financial condition before it was publicly released. He also tipped Galleon’s founder about a pending joint venture between the Clearwire Corporation and Sprint Nextel, a deal in which the chip maker Intel planned to invest $1 billion. Mr. Goel was a managing director in Intel’s treasury department until he left the company in late January.

While they lived on different coasts, the men kept in touch regularly and their families vacationed together, Mr. Goel said in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Rajaratnam twice gave Mr. Goel money for “personal financial reasons” and often asked Mr. Goel questions about Intel.

Prosecutors said had Mr. Goel not pleaded guilty, they were prepared to prove that he had committed the crimes, in part, with wiretapped recordings of Mr. Rajaratnam in 2008. Agents for the F.B.I. secretly listened to numerous conversations Mr. Rajaratnam had with various sources of insider tips that resulted in over $50 million in gains for Galleon, according to prosecutors.
1189 2010-02-09 The other day, I went to a psychology lecture and I could see how I could turn what I’d just heard into an experiment. This colleague was working on decision-making and he’d theorized that it is guided, in part, by the release of dopamine. So I told him, “We can make dopamine go up very suddenly in the neurocircuitry — we can emulate that little release of chemicals in the dish.” So that means it’s possible to work out these theoretical ideas in the lab. People 30 years ago in neuroscience were smart, but they didn’t have the instrumentation to test their ideas. That’s only become possible in the last 10 years. And it’s a very different feeling.

Q. IS YOUR LAB DEVELOPING ANY OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY?

A. Yes. We are developing ways to look into brain tissue while it is thinking. The tools are optical, like the microscopes I build to observe and manipulate synapse function. In my lab, we can tickle different parts of a circuit tens of thousands of times a second. That’s close to emulating real brain function.

Q. YOU ARE STUDYING THE STRUCTURE OF DOG BRAINS. HOW DID THAT PROJECT BEGIN?

A. My wife and I took our pet pug for spinal surgery. At the vet’s office, there were all these M.R.I.’s sitting around, hundreds of them, and it struck me: “Hey, dogs aren’t covered by Hipaa! Their records aren’t confidential!”

It was like discovering a goldmine of data. We’ve since gotten all these veterinarians on Long Island and in Maryland to donate M.R.I.’s, and we have this huge database. We’re looking for relationships between dog brain size and dog breed characteristics. Australian sheep dogs and poodles can do fairly complex tasks. My pug, he’s very sweet, but he’s not the brightest.

There’s actually a lot of scientific literature on breed characteristics, intelligence and temperament. So we check all these M.R.I.’s against these studies, and we’re trying to find structural correlates. This is a huge opportunity to look at the relationship between brain structure and behavior. We’re asking, Do we find a larger cortex — the part of the brain that’s involved in problem solving and intelligence — in those breeds that are good in problem solving? Or, Could we find a larger amygdala, which is related to emotional responses, in dogs that are known to be high strung or nasty?

Q. ARE THERE IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMANS IN THIS?

A. That’s not clear yet. Dogs are much more variable than we are. Dogs can vary by a factor of 60 in body mass and a factor of 3 in brain size. This kind of variation is not something you commonly run across in humans. Compared with dogs, we’re all alike. There’s no striking difference between Einstein’s brain compared to that of non-Einsteins.

Q. YOU SAY THAT FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING HAS CHANGED BRAIN RESEARCH. DO YOU FIND THAT SOME RESEARCHERS ARE OVERINTERPRETING IT?

A. For some, it’s the new phrenology. There was a piece in one of the newspapers where someone was claiming that he could tell the difference between a liberal and conservative from F.M.R.I. It made me want to scream. The study was done on very small numbers of people and told us next to nothing about the mental process underlying how we form political opinions.

Q. WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE YOU MEET AT PARTIES ABOUT YOUR WORK, WHAT DO THEY SAY?

A. They are very interested. There’s a lot of fascination with neuroscience because the brain determines who we are. The problem is that they’ve got all these myths. The most common one is we only use 10 percent of our brain. This began with Dale Carnegie, the father of the self-help movement, but it’s completely untrue. The proof is that if any one part of the brain is damaged, there’s usually a serious symptom. If you’d cut out 5 percent, it would be terrible. The second thing they want to know is if doing Sudoku will help them maintain mental fitness. I have to tell them, no, but doing physical exercise might. Then, they want to know if playing Mozart to babies makes them smarter. I tell them that babies are very good at learning from their environment, but Mozart appreciation comes later.

Q. GOING BACK TO YOUR YOUTHFUL DECISION TO ABANDON PHYSICS AND TAKE UP NEUROSCIENCE: ANY REGRETS?

A. Never. My parents, who were immigrants, didn’t understand it at the time. My father’s proud of me now. But my mother really wanted me to be an M.D. Even after I got a Ph.D., she still wanted that. She once sent me a brochure about a medical school in the Caribbean where I could become an M.D. in a year. My mother died a few years ago. I cannot remember ever being able to adequately explain to her what I do. That has a little to do with why I wrote, “Welcome to Your Brain.” I wanted to show how neuroscience speaks to everyday life.
1190 2010-02-09 About 40 years ago, researchers discovered that when humans jump, they activate their ankle muscles before landing as protection against the force of impact. Furthermore, the intensity of this muscle-tensing depends on the size of the jump — the bigger the fall, the more electrical activity in the muscles — and activation occurs at a fixed interval before landing no matter how big the jump.

The same phenomenon has been seen in a few other mammals. But a whole part of the animal kingdom — frogs and toads — jumps all the time. What about them?

Gary B. Gillis, a professor at Mount Holyoke College, and several students set out to answer that question. They chose the cane toad, Bufo marinus (which, by the way, is an invasive species in Australia and has people there hopping mad).

“Toads are incredibly good landers,” Dr. Gillis said. They use their forelimbs to absorb most of the impact, so he and his students measured muscular activity in two forelimb muscles.

As they report in Biology Letters, they found that the toad muscles have the same kind of activation patterns: the longer the jump, the greater the intensity. And one of the muscles always activated about 90 milliseconds before landing, even if that meant activating before takeoff.

Dr. Gillis said there must be a sensory feedback mechanism so the animals had “some way of knowing how hard they’re going to land.”
1191 2010-02-09 Older mothers are more likely than younger ones to have a child with autism, and older fathers significantly contribute to the risk of the disorder when their partners are under 30, researchers are reporting.

In a study published online on Monday in the journal Autism Research, the researchers analyzed almost five million births in California during the 1990s, and 12,159 cases of autism diagnosed in those children — a sample large enough to examine how the risk of autism was affected when one parent was a specific age and the other was the same age or considerably older or younger.

Previous research found that the risk of autism grew with the age of the father. The new study suggested that when the father was over 40 and the mother under 30, the increased risk was especially pronounced — 59 percent greater than for younger men.

By contrast, for women 30 and older, the risk of autism rose 13 percent when the father was over 40.

Every five-year increase in a mother’s age raised her risk of having a child with autism by 18 percent; a 40-year-old woman’s risk was 50 percent greater than that of a woman who became a mother in her late 20s, and 77 percent higher than that of a woman under 25.

But while the number of California women giving birth in their 40s rose sharply in the 1990s, the researchers said that could not account for the sevenfold rise in autism during the decade.
1192 2010-02-09 These publishers, who requested anonymity because their discussions with Google are confidential, said Google had relaxed its plans to allow customers to print or cut and paste.

“Google has always been open to working with publishers as part of Google Editions, in terms of supporting an open and competitive e-book market,” said Daniel Clancy, director of Google Books.

How e-books are sold — and for how much — has been a crucial topic of debate among publishers and retailers for the last two years, as digital books have taken off. Led by Amazon.com’s Kindle electronic reading device, the e-book market is growing at a fast clip, fueled partly by cheap digital editions. Amazon and several other retailers now offer new releases and best sellers for $9.99, far less than the typical $26 cover price on hardcovers.

Publishers have been fretting that such pricing has devalued books in the minds of consumers and have been looking for ways to regain control of what readers pay. When Apple unveiled its iPad, it said it had agreements with five of the country’s six largest publishers. Under those agreements, publishers would set e-book prices — within limits — so that new releases of most general fiction and nonfiction would sell for $12.99 to $14.99. Apple will act as an agent of the publishers — a set-up known in the publishing world as the agency model — and take a 30 percent cut of each sale, leaving the rest for publishers to split with authors.

In early negotiations, the 63 percent Google had been offering publishers was based on a wholesale model, but executives briefed on the discussions said that Google was now open to talking about an agency model and was also prepared to discuss paying publishers 70 percent of each sale.

Even Amazon has been forced to back off its $9.99 pricing in an agreement with Macmillan, one of the country’s six largest publishers. In a recent dust-up after Macmillan told Amazon it was moving to the 30 percent agency model with higher consumer pricing, Amazon removed direct access to Macmillan’s physical and electronic books from its site for a week. Amazon later surrendered to the publisher’s terms.

Google’s e-book retail program would be separate from the company’s class-action settlement with authors and publishers over its book-scanning project, under which Google has scanned more than seven million volumes — mostly out of print — from several university libraries. That settlement was recently imperiled by a filing from the Department of Justice that said it still had significant legal problems with the agreement, even after a round of revisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.

Google users can already search up to about 20 percent of the content of many new books that publishers have agreed to enroll in a search program. According to publishers, Google originally said it would automatically enroll any book sold through Google Editions in the search program. An executive from at least one of the six largest publishers said the company did not agree with those terms. Mr. Clancy said that Google would not require books sold through Google Editions to be part of the search program.

Last May Tom Turvey, director of strategic partnerships at Google, told publishers at the annual BookExpo convention in New York that Google’s program for selling new e-book editions would allow consumers to read books on any device with Internet access, including mobile phones, rather than being limited to dedicated reading devices like the Amazon Kindle.

Google, without its own e-reader, wants to be a Switzerland of sorts, competing with Barnes & Noble and other e-book sellers to become the preferred digital bookstore on devices other than the iPad or the Kindle, such as Android smart phones.

In general, publishers are eager for Google to enter the e-book market because they want more competition. “We would love to have a diverse marketplace for e-books,” said Maja Thomas, senior vice president for the digital division of Hachette Book Group, which publishes blockbuster authors like James Patterson and Stephenie Meyer. Since Google would contribute to such diversity, Ms. Thomas said, “we welcome them.”

If Google does enter the e-book market, it would be one of a handful of programs under which the company sells content directly to consumers. Google generates the majority of its revenue from ad sales on its search pages and on the Web sites of publishing partners. It is now charging for content through its YouTube unit, renting digital versions of independent films tied to the Sundance Film Festival.
1193 2010-02-09 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan— Three people were killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at the election office of a former federal minister and opposition leader Monday evening in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, police and rescue officials said. At least five people were wounded.

Witnesses said two men on a motorbike opened fire on the former official, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, and his supporters as they left an election office in the Khayaban-e-Sir-Syed nighborhood around 5:45 p.m. Mr. Ahmed, who served as minister for information under former President Pervez Musharraf, survived the attack with minor injuries.

An official of the rescue service said Mr. Ahmed was not shot but fell down and hurt his knee in the pandemonium after the attack.

He was ferried to District Headquarter Hospital as hundreds of his supporters took to the streets despite a heavy downpour of rain and chanted slogans against a rival political party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, which is headed by Nawaz Sharif.

The attempt Mr. Rashid’s life is likely to raise the political temperature within the country.

He is running for a seat in the National Assembly in a by-election scheduled for Feb.24.
1194 2010-02-09 Babies who die of sudden infant death syndrome may have low levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in regulating breathing and other vital functions, a new study suggests.

Harvard researchers who made the discovery said that it took them a step closer to understanding why babies who appeared to be perfectly healthy might die suddenly, and that it could eventually lead to development of a screening test to identify at-risk infants.

“This says SIDS is a disease process,” said Dr. Hannah C. Kinney, a professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and senior author of the paper, published Feb. 3 in The Journal of the American Medical Association. “It’s not a bolt out of the blue; it’s not a mystery. You can study this problem with the scientific method, and you can make headway.”

As part of the study, researchers analyzed tissue samples from infants who died of SIDS and a smaller number who died of other causes. They found that serotonin levels in the brain stem were 26 percent lower in the SIDS group.

The SIDS babies also had lower levels of an enzyme involved in synthesizing serotonin.

Dr. Kinney said the discovery did not alter the “back to sleep” message that infants should be put to sleep on their back.

1218 2010-02-10 Gen. Nikolai Makarov, the chief of Russia’s general staff, said Tuesday that Russian discontent over the planned American missile defense system was holding up negotiations to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start. “Despite official statements that the missile defense system will ensure our security, this is far from the truth,” General Makarov, above, told Vesti, a television news channel. “It is natural that we view this very negatively, because this to some extent can weaken our missile capability.”

His remarks were the harshest assessment from Moscow since Romania announced that it would be willing to accept land-based missile interceptors starting in 2015. President Obama had overhauled plans to locate interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic, largely easing Russian fears that the system could stop Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles.

But the White House denied that the antimissile system was a factor in the Start talks. Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, said that President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia never mentioned it when he spoke with Mr. Obama recently. “I think the notion that somehow this is in any way an impediment to what’s going on with Start is simply not true,” Mr. Gibbs said.
1219 2010-02-10 Investors in collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.’s, were badly burned by increases in interest rates in 1994. Some of the factors are again present. Banks and other investors in the little-known trillion-dollar market could be set for a spill.

C.M.O.’s sound and look similar to collateralized debt obligations, the structured products that helped bring the financial market to its knees in 2008. There’s one big difference. C.M.O.’s are built out of mortgage bonds guaranteed by the government-sponsored agencies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Should defaults on the underlying securities mount, these agencies — and ultimately the government — will keep investors whole.

Partly because of this backing, $176 billion of C.M.O.’s were issued in the second half of 2009, four times the amount in the second half of 2008, according to data from Thomson Reuters. About $1 trillion of the instruments are outstanding, Barclays Capital estimates. Some banks and other investors have been buying them partly because as a result of purchases by the Federal Reserve, there is a shortage of mortgage-backed securities.

Despite their creditworthiness, C.M.O.’s can drop sharply in value when interest rates rise or when short- and long-term borrowing costs converge, known as a flattening of the yield curve. In 1994, both those things happened when the Fed started raising rates aggressively. With today’s short-term rates near zero and the yield curve near a record steep incline, those circumstances could conspire against investors again.

C.M.O.’s have the effect of slicing up the underlying mortgage bonds by different maturities. They are often used to help manage mortgage investment risks such as prepayment by borrowers. Banks commonly buy short-dated C.M.O.’s. If they have stuck with that strategy, higher rates won’t hurt them much. But if they’ve bought longer-term C.M.O.’s in search of more yield — as pension funds do, for instance — a spike in rates could generate big paper losses.
1220 2010-02-10 LONDON — Hector W. Sants, the chief executive of Britain’s financial services regulator, said Tuesday that he would leave the agency by the end of the summer.

The announcement was made before a general election in Britain by early June that could diminish the role of the regulator, the Financial Services Authority.

The opposition Conservative Party, which has been leading in recent polls, has said that it will abolish the authority and give its supervisory responsibilities to the Bank of England.

Mr. Sants, a former Credit Suisse banker, said Tuesday that he had planned to leave the position after three years, but some analysts said his departure could be the start of a regulatory overhaul in Britain. Governments have been revisiting banking regulation in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

“When I was appointed, I told the board that I planned to serve as C.E.O. for three years, and I intend to stick to that timetable,” Mr. Sants said in a statement on the authority’s Web site.

The authority came under increasing pressure under his leadership for the failure of the British mortgage lender Northern Rock in 2008. Mr. Sants acknowledged that flawed regulatory procedures failed to avert the collapse of the bank, and he hired staff to improve supervision.
1221 2010-02-10 Another nominee, William Charles Ostendorff, said that one of the biggest problems facing the regulatory commission would be to balance oversight of the licensing of new reactors and of the safe operation of older, existing plants with “piping concerns” like the leaks.

The industry hopes to break ground soon on new plants soon, for the first time in 30 years, but opponents say tritium leaks show the industry is not to be trusted.

Mr. Magwood’s nomination has drawn some opposition in the Senate, but he, Mr. Ostendorff and a third nominee, George E. Apostolakis, all appear likely to win confirmation to the five-member commission.

Tritium — a radioactive form of hydrogen that is colorless, odorless and tasteless — is incorporated into the water molecule and impossible to filter out, raising fears even if it has no health impact.

The leaks have set off a political furor.

After a leak at an Illinois plant in 2006, the Legislature there passed a law requiring prompt reporting.

The industry acknowledges it has a problem.

“When people hear terms like leak, tritium, and groundwater, and when you put those words together in a single sentence, the normal person is going to get uneasy,” said Ralph Andersen, senior director for radiation safety and environmental protection at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s trade association.

In Vermont, a particularly adamant cadre of environmentalists who oppose nuclear reactors has gained substantial momentum in the last few weeks because of the discovery of leaking tritium. The Legislature may block a 20-year extension of the plant’s operating license, which expires in 2012.

“They’ve completely lost the trust of Vermonters,” said James W. Moore, an energy expert at the Vermont Public Interest Research Group.

The governor, James H. Douglas, long a supporter of continued operation of the plant, recently acknowledged that the politics of the issue had changed and suggested the Legislature delay any decisions about Vermont Yankee.

The leaks came to light only because of a nationwide effort that the nuclear industry began in May 2006 to grapple with the issue after the discovery of leaks at two sites in Illinois and one in New York.

Now industry officials say that perhaps a third of the reactors nationwide have had such leaks. Twelve sites have filed official reports since 2003, and more may be discovered soon. A spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Scott Burnell, said that nearly all of them are vulnerable.

“You’ve got storage tanks and you’ve got pipes that crisscross under the site,” Mr. Burnell said of the reactors. “The possibility is there at every site.”

Around the country, in all but one case the releases that produced elevated concentrations of tritium were entirely on the plant site and were not in drinking water, according to the industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The exception was Braidwood, about 60 miles southwest of Chicago, the plant that prompted the Illinois Legislature to act. The Environmental Protection Agency sets a standard for how much tritium is allowed in drinking water. But at Vermont Yankee and other places, the tritium has not been found in drinking water but in groundwater.

So the releases have so far not put any plant in violation of its radiation discharge limits.
1222 2010-02-10 Airgas, the industrial gases company, formally rejected a $5.1 billion takeover offer from its rival, Air Products and Chemicals, on Tuesday saying the proposal “significantly undervalues” the company.

In a letter sent to Air Products’ chairman and chief executive, John E. McGlade, Airgas rejected both the current $60-a-share cash bid and a $62-a-share cash-and-stock offer made in December.

“Airgas’ management and its board are extremely enthusiastic about our company’s prospects and are confident of achieving stockholder returns well in excess of what can be derived from Air Products’ unsolicited and opportunistic proposal,” Airgas’s chief executive, Peter McCausland, wrote in the letter.

He added: “It makes no sense for the Airgas stockholders to transfer the future value of Airgas to Air Products at a bargain-basement price.”

The letter was largely a formality, since Airgas had rebuffed two previous proposals from Air Products over the last four months and had privately dismissed the latest approach.
1223 2010-02-10 Young athletes who sustain concussions would not be allowed to return to practice or games without written medical clearance under legislation proposed in Missouri.

Growing attention to the long-term risks of concussions for professional athletes has Missouri lawmakers joining those in at least a half-dozen states seeking to require the benching of injured younger players, for whom concussion dangers are even greater.

Missouri’s proposed law — aimed at high school athletes — would require players be kept out of practices and games until cleared by a licensed health care worker trained in evaluating and managing concussions. Athletes and their families also would need to be provided information about concussions and head injuries.
1224 2010-02-10 Six N.H.L. teams will open the 2010-11 season in Europe, the fourth straight year the league will begin play overseas. Carolina and Minnesota will meet in two games in Helsinki, Finland, on Oct. 7 and 8; Columbus will play San Jose in Stockholm on Oct. 8 and 9; and Boston and Phoenix face off in Prague on Oct. 9 and 10.
1225 2010-02-10 Take away the first word in their names and there are not many similarities between Newark Liberty International Airport and Newark Municipal Court. One of them sends airplanes all over the planet. The other is a few blocks from a business that calls itself New Jersey’s largest pawn broker. Amelia Earhart led the dedication of the first terminal at one of them. People fight tickets for illegal dumping and peddling at the other.

And at one of them, Haisong Jiang had to pass through a metal detector.

This occurred on Tuesday, when he entered the front lobby of the courthouse for his arraignment on charges that he breached security at the airport on Jan. 3. Mr. Jiang’s actions caused the evacuation of the airport’s busiest terminal, setting off several hours of chaos.

In video from the airport that day, one Transportation Security Administration officer can be seen walking away from his post. On Tuesday, there were four officers stationed in the courthouse’s lobby, with three more nearby, and they stayed put.

In a building where blue jeans and sweats are the norm, Mr. Jiang, 28, arrived in a smart dark suit and with a lawyer, Eric B. Bruce, from a multinational firm, Kobre & Kim. Gone was the light-colored coat he was wearing in the video, known to millions from grainy footage broadcast during the manhunt for him; he was arrested five days after the breach.

Gone, too, was the woman Mr. Jiang had climbed under a security belt to kiss that day at Newark — a moment captured on the tape. But she was not in evidence in gritty downtown Newark on Tuesday.
1226 2010-02-10 The Coca-Cola Company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday as higher demand in Brazil, China and India offset a decline in North America.

Lower costs and higher volume helped increase profit, which was in line with analysts’ estimates. The company gained market share in the carbonated and noncarbonated beverage categories.

The results continued a trend for the company, which sells Diet Coke, Sprite and Dasani water among other brands. The company has relied on strength overseas to counter a weak North American market that has experienced high unemployment and low consumer confidence.

“This continues to be a story about emerging-market growth,” an analyst at Morningstar, Phil Gorham, said. He pointed to the strong numbers in China and India, particularly when comparing them against “a pretty strong quarter in ’08.”

“With consumers still challenged by a mixed global recovery, there again may be bumps along the way, with quarter-to-quarter volatility still possible as we move through 2010,” the chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said.
1227 2010-02-10 “Recommendations for the euro area as a whole and its member states should be strengthened, with a stronger focus on competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances,” the draft says. “This would be in line with the importance of economic spillover effects in the monetary union and the challenges the euro area is facing.”

Diplomats say that markets will expect a strong signal on debt levels in Greece, Portugal and Spain from the European Union leaders at the meeting and that the leaders will, at the very least, need to make a statement on the Greek situation.

On Tuesday, the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso — whose second term in office was endorsed by the European Parliament in Strasbourg — insisted that the “euro area has the capacity to deal with the difficulties.”

Though private discussions about a last-ditch bailout of Greece have taken place behind the scenes, the European Union leaders are hoping that they can reassure the markets that this will not be necessary. Some analysts have argued that the heads of government should use the summit meeting to draw up procedures and structures to deal with a potential default in the euro zone.

But Mr. Van Rompuy hopes to use the crisis to focus on medium-term reforms. He is expected to suggest that leaders agree to accept a maximum of five overall goals. These, to be proposed by Mr. Barroso, are likely to include such areas as spending on research and development, objectives for the digital economy, energy and green growth and overall employment goals.

Individual countries would eventually set out their own detailed objectives, differentiated according to their starting points.

Governments and the European Commission would also identify “the most pressing bottlenecks and barriers hampering growth.” The billions of euros spent by the European Union in structural fund subsidies or lending from the European Investment Bank would be used as incentives, the draft says.

Meanwhile, European members of Parliament formally voted a new European Commission into power on Tuesday, ending months of stalled policy making. By 488 votes to 137, with 72 abstentions, the legislators approved the new commission after more than three months of delays.

The Parliament’s endorsement completes a long, bruising, personal battle for Mr. Barroso to remain in office. With his mandate now secure, Mr. Barroso has, in theory, more freedom to use the significant economic powers that the European Commission holds within the bloc, where it acts as antitrust regulator, trade negotiator and guarantor of the union’s single market of almost 500 million consumers.

But, during a parliamentary debate Tuesday, Mr. Barroso rejected criticism from some deputies that he had been too reluctant to push European integration against opposition from national capitals. He was, he said, ready to be bold, but added, “The commission cannot establish its influence, its power, its leadership against the democratic member states.”
1228 2010-02-10 WASHINGTON (AP) — Businesses sharply reduced their wholesale inventories in December, a much weaker showing than expected and a troubling sign that companies are still too pessimistic about the economy to begin restocking shelves on a sustained basis.

Economists maintain that the country will not be in a sustained recovery until businesses begin restocking their depleted shelves, which will mean higher orders to factories and demand for manufacturing workers.

The Commerce Department said Tuesday that wholesale inventories fell 0.8 percent in December. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected inventories to rise 0.5 percent during the month.

The government said that sales at the wholesale level rose in December, increasing 0.8 percent.

The weakness in inventory rebuilding in December was an indication that businesses, still struggling to emerge from the deepest recession in decades, are not yet confident enough in rising sales to begin rebuilding stockpiles on a sustained basis.

The 0.8 percent drop in wholesale inventories followed a 1.6 percent rise in November that had set off hopes that businesses were growing more optimistic after a prolonged period of slashing inventories.

The 0.8 percent rise in sales followed an even bigger 3.6 percent increase in sales in November. Economists had expected a 0.5 percent sales rise in December.

Wholesalers hold 25 percent of all inventories, with factories holding about one-third and retailers holding the rest.
1229 2010-02-10 For more than a decade, the two men, Ray Tomkinson of Manchester, England, and Alvaro Gallego of Queens, both taxi entrepreneurs with a love of vintage vehicles, have swapped these signature vehicles of their homelands — along with modern models, parts and other taxi paraphernalia — across the Atlantic Ocean, typically on barter.

“Basically no cash changes hands,” Mr. Tomkinson said. “We were just paying for each other’s shipping, and the cabs were going across the Atlantic backward and forward.”

Mr. Tomkinson, who took over his family taxi company in Manchester in the early 1970s, has amassed a large collection of antique cabs from around the world. Mr. Gallego, a Colombian immigrant and a former cab driver, has run a company that specializes in taxi meter repairs for 38 years, collecting vehicles on the side.

In addition to bolstering personal collections, their cars are rented out for film shoots and promotional campaigns — like when British Airways hired one of Mr. Tomkinson’s Checker cabs to drive around London and one of Mr. Gallego’s black cabs to drive around New York to advertise flights between the two cities.

The two men have done business for about 12 years but have never met. For all the cabs they have shipped across the ocean — more than two dozen — neither man has ever made the trip himself. “I consider him my friend,” Mr. Gallego said. “We’ve been so long together talking about taxis, business. We have a passion for what we do.”

There is something fitting that in the world of intercontinental antique vehicle swapping, it would be these two models passing each other at sea.

The designs of both the Checker and black cabs — largely unchanged since the 1950s — have come to symbolize their home cities, their distinctive curves adorning all manner of gift-shop knickknacks. And both were made explicitly to be taxis — purpose-built, according to the industry lingo — with roomy back seats large enough to comfortably hold five people thanks to the rear-facing, flip-down jump seats.

But the bulk that made the cars so endearing to generations of riders also drove up costs and drove down fuel efficiency. Once the most common taxi model in New York, the Checker ended production in 1982 after it proved unable to compete with converted passenger vehicles like the now-ubiquitous Ford Crown Victoria. The final Checker retired from service in New York 17 years later. The black cab still accounts for an overwhelming majority of the London taxi fleet, though it too has been pressed by new models, stoking the fear that it could go the way of the Checker.

Fans say the cabs have timeless qualities. “Both are strong and good cars,” Mr. Gallego said. “They’ve been doing what they’ve been supposed to be doing for so many years, moving people from A to B in a safe way, in a roomy way.”

He and Mr. Tomkinson developed an interest in antique taxis by starting with their own domestic variety.

After years of acquiring and restoring old British cars at his garage in Manchester Mr. Tomkinson, now 62, began renting them out for period movies and television shows. About 15 years ago, a producer asked him for a New York cab. “So I diversified,” he said.

Mr. Gallego, 64, had nurtured an interest in old taxis since first sitting behind the wheel of a cab four decades ago when he was still new to America. His skill at tracking down old parts and models for other collectors led him to start a second business, Taxidepot, renting old cabs and antique car equipment to movie and television producers.

Eventually Mr. Tomkinson was introduced to Mr. Gallego as someone who could handle his business in the United States. At first, Mr. Tomkinson paid cash for the vehicles that Mr. Gallego helped procure.

That work led to Mr. Gallego inquiring about the feasibility of sending London cabs to New York. Soon they were working out trades. “I would get a taxi, he would get a taxi,” Mr. Gallego said. “He’d say: ‘Get me four Crown Victorias in nice condition; you get a London cab.’ ”

Each speaks with pride about the cabs they have traded for. “It’s good to see these old cabs not retire,” Mr. Tomkinson said. “They’re still earning a living somehow.”
1230 2010-02-10 The debts of the poorer members of the European Union have cast doubt over the future of the euro and raised concern that, like so many strapped banks before them, some of European Union nations might need to be bailed out. The financial pressure on these countries — notably Greece — has been building for weeks, and the tensions reached new heights last week.

But the cascade of losses began to reverse itself on Tuesday as several European officials suggested that the European Union would step in to avert a crisis, and the governments of Greece and Portugal vowed to carry out austerity measures in an effort to win back the confidence of shaken bond investors.

The Greek stock market surged 5 percent, and the nation’s beleaguered government bond market also rallied. The euro strengthened 0.7 percent against the dollar, to $1.3775.

The leaders of the 27 European Union countries will meet on Thursday to tackle, among other things, Greece’s swelling deficit, which remains about 13 percent of gross domestic product.

But exactly what will come out of that meeting remains unclear. European leaders may take a symbolic route and try to restore confidence by backing loans in Greece and elsewhere. Or they may decide to unveil a more sweeping bailout plan for weaker nations, with the help of the Continent’s better-off nations.

“This will be further discussed in the coming days,” said Olli Rehn, who is about to take over as European economic affairs commissioner. “We are talking about support in the broad sense of the word.”

In an interview at his home in Lisbon, Portugal’s prime minister, José Sócrates, rejected outside help entirely. “We don’t need anything from Brussels,” he said. “We know exactly what we will do. We don’t need any help; we will solve our problems.”

The enthusiasm among investors on Tuesday was started by reports that Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, would leave a conference in Australia early to attend the summit meeting on Thursday.

But just as markets began to froth, central bank officials played down the significance of his itinerary. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trichet said he had planned to attend the meeting even before he left for Australia.

“It was pure logistics,” the spokeswoman said, declining to comment on whether Europe was moving closer to a bailout of Greece.

A person in the German government with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed that Germany was involved in direct consultations with the other 15 countries that use the euro over possible ways to help the Greek government. But the individual, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the plans, said any action would take place “within a European framework.”

“It’s just about finding a way to potentially give Greece a little breathing room,” he said. He dismissed reports that Germany was considering a unilateral aid package for Greece. “The idea that we would go it alone is completely nuts.”

A spokesman for Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, said it was “wrong” that Berlin had already decided to provide financial assistance to Greece.

In the United States, Wall Street welcomed its winning day after weeks of volatility. The Dow remains about 6 percent off of its late January highs, and its close below 10,000 Monday delivered a psychological setback to those who hoped for a steady rebound.

Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, said a bailout plan for Greece would provide a blueprint for rescue if other countries began to reel. “Some of the overarching fears of global contagion will then begin to recede,” he said. “Greece is first and foremost the touchstone.”

The near-term direction of the market will depend on whether the European Union’s actions on Greece adequately quell fears among investors, analysts said. They remain concerned by the possibility of a series of defaults, which could raise the cost of lending around the world and slow the broader economic recovery.

Rumblings of a bailout plan sent the cost of insuring Greek debt down sharply — about 19 percent — as investors grew more confident that the government would be able to repay its debt. The cost to insure Spanish, Portuguese and Italian debt fell by similar margins.

Investors have grown wary of the feeble public finances of a number of countries that use the euro — particularly Greece, Portugal, Spain and, to a lesser extent, Italy — raising fear that the entire currency system could come under attack.

United States Treasury securities, which had gained over the last week as investors sought shelter from the financial turmoil in Europe, tumbled on Tuesday as those earlier trades were reversed. The Treasury also sold a record-tying $40 billion of three- year notes, further depressing the bond market.

The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 21/32, to 97 26/32. The yield rose to 3.65 percent, from 3.56 percent late Monday.

Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of four- and 52-week bills and three-year notes:
1231 2010-02-10 NEW DELHI — Sri Lanka’s president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the way for elections to choose a new legislature even as a bitter dispute raged over the fate of the main challenger in last month’s presidential election.

Angry supporters of Sarath Fonseka, the retired general who was arrested Monday night after his unsuccessful run for president, accused the government of assaulting him and worried about his safety while in government custody.

Anoma Fonseka, the candidate’s wife, said she had not been able to find General Fonseka since he was arrested by dozens of military police officers in what witnesses described as a commando-style raid on his office.

“I am so worried because I know he is in danger,” Mrs. Fonseka said in a telephone interview.

Several people who attended the meeting of political leaders where he was arrested said General Fonseka was badly manhandled and carried bodily out of the room when he tried to protest.

General Fonseka ran for president in last month’s election, mounting a surprise challenge to his onetime ally, President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The two men had worked closely together to defeat the 26-year-old Tamil Tiger insurgency but became estranged in the aftermath of the war.
1232 2010-02-10 THE problems with most real whole wheat muffins are multiple: they’re heavy, dense and even slightly bitter, unless they contain a ton of sugar. Which explains why many “whole wheat” recipes call for wheat and white flour.

But this need not be. Enter whole wheat muffin 2.0; if you didn’t know it, you’d think the muffins here were made from something else.

Start with whole wheat pastry flour, which is ground much finer than regular wheat flour and results in a more delicate, lighter crumb. The other “secret” is to use a cup of puréed or mashed fruit or vegetable — banana, pumpkin, sweet potato, zucchini, apple — to smooth the flavor of the muffin and ensure a moist consistency. Bananas and cooked pumpkin or sweet potato are easy enough to mash, but if you’re going with raw apple or zucchini, use a food processor fitted with a metal blade to purée it.

Like any muffin or quick bread dough, this one works best when handled minimally: mix together the dry ingredients, then the wet, and then fold the wet into the dry until everything is just combined, being careful not to over-mix the batter. If you mix too vigorously, you might overdevelop the gluten in the flour and end up with tough muffins, regardless of the flour type. Don’t fret about a few lumps; they’ll work themselves out while they bake.

Think of this as a master recipe and play with the ingredients to suit your taste. This recipe can handle about a half-cup of nuts, raisins or other dried fruit, shredded coconut, even chocolate chips; just don’t overload it with mix-ins. And a pinch of spice isn’t amiss, either. Some of my favorite combos are banana-walnut, pumpkin-coconut, and sweet potato with cardamom and ginger, none of them leaden, all of them whole wheat.

1243 2010-02-11 A panel of analysts, academics and former police officials is poised to debate one of the New York Police Department’s most controversial policies – “Stop, Question and Frisk” – at a summit at the city’s Bar Association offices.

Many believe the timing could not be better.

As of early Thursday, people were still waiting for the department to produce its anticipated quarterly report about how many New Yorkers have been stopped on the streets by police officers in the last three months of 2009 – a final piece of data that is necessary to determine the overall number of street stops in all of 2009.

By all accounts, it is likely to be a record-breaking year.

There were about 450,000 stops in the first three-quarters of 2009, from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30. That was up from around 391,000 stops in the same period in 2008, a 15 percent increase.

And last year’s tally of 531,159 stops – up from 468,932 in 2007 – already represents the most voluminous amount of stops in any 12-month period in the years since the Police Department began reporting the data.

The department is required to release to the City Council, four times a year, basic data about the people who are stopped and questioned by officers, and the reasons for such encounters. Due 30 days after a quarter ends, the report for the last quarter of 2009 was due at the beginning of February.

“The department routinely manipulates the timing of its release of the stop-and-frisk reports to minimize news reporting about the numbers,” said Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which monitors the data. “Invariably, they produce the reports to the City Council very late in the day and usually on Friday evenings.”

The guidelines for outside oversight of the data were set forth in a city law signed in 2001, and which sprang from public outrage over the 1999 fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black street peddler.

Race is one prism through which to view the data.

About 82 percent of those stopped in the first three quarters of 2009 were black or Hispanic. According to figures from the Center for Constitutional Rights, blacks were stopped 239,244 times in the first three-quarters of 2009; Latinos were stopped 140,697 times; and whites, 42,053 times.

Another prism through which to analyze the data is determining how many arrests the street stops produce.

For example, the number of arrests that emanated from the stops in the first three-quarters of 2009 was 26,813, and the number of summonses was 28,705, according to Center for Constitutional Rights.

A third prism for understanding the data is the rationale for the stops.

It used to be that officers had to write the reason for the stop on a police form – known as a UF-250 – that officers are required to fill out after each stop. Explaining the legal rationale for any stop, in their own hand, allowed officers to demonstrate an understanding of the law they could easily articulate and communicate.

But the current UF-250 forms include 10 options with boxes to be checked under the question: “What Were the Circumstances Which Led to a Stop? (must check at least one box).” The new method, akin to a multiple-choice test, can inoculate officers from any criticism over possibly faulty reasoning.

“Furtive Movements” and, “Actions Indicative of ‘Casing’ Victim or Location,” said Darius Charney, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which sued the city in federal court in 2008, charging that it has a policy of conducting unconstitutional stop-and-frisks and singles out ethnic minorities.

Police officials have said that while a large percentage of the street stops involve blacks, an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims. A departmental study of crime in the first six months of 2009, “Crime and Enforcement Activity in New York City,” includes information on the race and ethnicity of crime victims and suspects, broken down by crime category.

Such a study is produced every six months and the recent one highlights how, in many categories of crime, victims and suspects are most frequently black or Latino.

Police officials believe it is faulty to compare the number of street stops with the city’s population figures for race and ethnicity. Rather, they believe stop-and-frisk activity should be analyzed against data about crime-prone populations.

At the Bar Association summit, the panelists will explore the issues of whether the department’s stop-and-frisk polices are effective, fair and appropriate. The moderator will be Jeremy Travis, the president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

The summit is March 9 at the Bar Association offices, 42 West 44th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, according to Eric Friedman, a spokesman.

City policing and Major League Baseball have some long-established links.

Dan Mullin, who worked 23 years with the New York Police Department before retiring as a deputy chief, is the league’s senior director for security operations.

In 2008, when the baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, set up a department of investigations to look into allegations of illegal drug use by players, he tapped Mr. Mullin to lead the new effort.

The latest nexus between baseball and the Police Department – which is beset by its own thorny issues regarding steroid testing among officers – is that the department has been contracting with Gary Green, a doctor at the University of California Los Angeles and the top drug-testing consultant to Commissioner Selig.

Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly last year added steroids to the list of substances police officers are tested for. Reached by phone on Tuesday, Dr. Green was fairly tight-lipped about his work for the department.

He called himself a consultant to the police, but could not immediately say when his work began. He said he was not aiding in the writing of any policy, but is helping people in the department to understand the results of certain medical tests.

“When you get test results back, it is not black and white,” Dr. Green said. “A lot of interpretation has to be done.”

Dr. Green said he did not “want to do anything that will jeopardize any investigations,” stressing that consultants for law enforcement are not always privy to all aspects of such matters. He referred further questions to Julie L. Schwartz, the department’s legal advocate. She, in turn, referred queries to a departmental spokesman, who said it was “not unusual” for the department to hire consultants in such matters.

1 Police Plaza reported recently that John C. Liu, the newly elected city comptroller, had beefed up his security detail – doubling the number of police officers assigned to him at all times.

Now comes word that Christine Leung, a retired member of the New York Police Department, has joined the comptroller’s office as a part-time, $40-an-hour planning coordinator in charge of security and safety.

In an interview, Ms. Leung said she took the job on Jan. 4, and hoped her policing experience would be a plus. Her duties include coordinating with the department’s Intelligence Division, which determines security staffing for public officials, and helping plan logistics and travel for Mr. Liu. She will also meet with security officials at the places that her new boss visits.

Ms. Leung, who was born in Hong Kong, worked in the Major Case Squad and retired form the Police Commissioner’s office in May 2004, a little more than 20 years after she joined the force in January 1984.

But many people might recall her from the documentary film, “Tea and Justice,” which chronicled the experiences of Asian women officers. “It is a serious documentary,” she said of the film, adding that she had departmental permission to do the work at the time.

The New York Civil Liberties Union wants to hear from former police commanders following a report by The New York Times over the weekend that more than 100 retired senior officers said in a survey they were aware crime statistics were manipulated because of the pressure to improve performance year after year.

Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the civil liberties group, digested the findings of the survey, which was done by two criminologists who are writing a book about the department’s CompStat program, and then analyzed Civilian Complaint Review Board reports about instances of the police refusing to process people’s complaints about crime.

There were 617 such complaints from 2004 to 2008, the most recent year for which there are data, Mr. Dunn said. Of those fully investigated, the review board validated the complainant in 10.7 percent of the cases, a higher than usual substantiation rate for all cases.

But beyond the numbers, Mr. Dunn said the civil liberties group was “interested in receiving reports from current or recent members of the department, to gauge the extent to which the police are systematically refusing to take complaints as a way to suppress crime figures.”

And on the crime front, detectives are gathering clues in a two-week-old case of a man’s murder in a jewelry store holdup on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.

No arrests have been made in the killing of Henry Menahem, 71, a worker at R. S. Durant, a jewelry store on Madison Avenue, who was shot as he worked in the store at midday on Jan. 27, the police said.

But “we’ve recovered some of the jewelry,” said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. He said investigators were “talking to someone in connection with the robbery.” But he stressed that he was not describing anyone as a suspect in the case.

Al Baker, police bureau chief for The New York Times — and the son of a police lieutenant — brings you inside the nation’s largest police force every Thursday. He will occasionally be joined by other reporters for The Times. He can be reached at OnePolicePlaza@nytimes.com.

1254 2010-02-11 Ms. King has denied wrongdoing. In papers responding to a civil suit filed against her by the sandhogs’ union, formally known as Local 147 of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, she said that its leaders were aware of her expenditures and gave her responsibilities that exceed the norm for a fund administrator.

One of her lawyers, Peter W. Till, said Ms. King disputed the comptroller’s audit findings about the probation officers’ union.

The criminal case and the audit raise questions about oversight of the more than $1 billion a year that the city provides to more than 100 union benefit funds. Each fund decides what to cover, including pension annuities, vacation pay and unreimbursed medical costs.

“On the assumption that the charges are true, in order to get away with this, the checks-and-balances system has to be compromised,” said Edwin H. Stier, a former federal prosecutor who served as a court-appointed trustee of a Teamsters local in New Jersey and who still runs its pension and welfare funds. “The question is, how was it compromised, and how were the trustees responsible for that happening?”

Ms. King administered the probation officers’ benefit funds for more than 20 years. Though the fund’s trustees rejected the comptroller’s findings, they fired Ms. King in response to her arrest, said the union’s president, Dominic S. Coluccio. He added that he did not believe any money was missing, but had directed a new accountant to review the funds’ books.

“When she was working for us, quite frankly, she did a good job,” Mr. Coluccio said. “People can argue over whether or not it was a lot of money.”

The city inquiry found that the probation officers’ funds claimed to have paid Ms. King’s company $174,500 in 2006 but had actually paid $608,174, nearly one-third of the money the funds received from the city. Other costs raised total administrative expenses to 38 percent. Funds of a similar size spent an average of 14 percent on administrative expenses, the audits showed.

Ms. King’s responsibilities included collecting contributions from employers, paying claims to beneficiaries and maintaining bank accounts. She did not handle investments.

The benefit funds are controlled by a board of trustees. Mr. Coluccio is the chairman of the board of the active employees’ fund. His wife, Elaine Pincus, for many years was the chairwoman of the retirees’ fund board.

The comptroller’s auditors said they could not “verify the existence” of the computers and software the funds reported purchasing, because Ms. King and Mr. Coluccio denied their requests for invoices and to see the equipment.

The auditors also called the expenditure “excessive,” given that the two funds have about 800 active and 360 retired members.

In response to questions the auditors raised about the existence of a “health and wellness” program, the union claimed that a company run by Ms. King had held 28 seminars at a Long Island hospital. But the comptroller said the seminars had actually been offered free by the hospital.

“This not only raises additional suspicions concerning the legitimacy of this ‘benefit’ but may constitute fraud on the part of” Ms. King’s company, King Care, the audit noted.

Mr. Coluccio said the programs and the computer equipment “absolutely exist.” He said the health and wellness program was part of the union’s effort to help its members deal with the added job stress of carrying firearms, which they began doing more than six years ago. “My members were happy with the benefit,” he said. “The comptroller was a little overzealous.”

Ms. King’s former company, King Administrators, went bankrupt in the late 1990s. But the probation officers union stuck with her, and a trustee of the benefit funds, Kurt Rosen, helped her get back on her feet.

In 1999, Mr. Rosen bought the home where Ms. King, 58, lives in Irvington, N.J., and signed a $900,000 mortgage for it. It does not appear that Mr. Rosen, 86, ever lived there.

The house was transferred to Ms. King, her father and a trust they control. Her lawyer, Mr. Till, said the trust holds the property on behalf of Ms. King’s children.

Mr. Coluccio said the house purchase was a personal matter between Mr. Rosen and Ms. King.

Mr. Rosen, a retired probation officer, resigned as a trustee of the funds about five years ago and now lives in Denmark, Mr. Coluccio said.
1255 2010-02-11 But one official briefed on the matter said that the subpoena sought documents related to Aqueduct Entertainment Group. Another official indicated that the investigation, which is in its earliest stages, encompasses both the nonprofit group and the gambling company, which has promised a $300 million bonus for the state.

Indeed, tax filings for New Directions suggest that there may be indirect ties with the gambling company, which counts the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a former congressman and among New York’s most influential and politically astute black pastors, as one of its investors.

The filings and the group’s Web site indicate that the treasurer for New Directions is Edwin Reed, until 2007 the chief financial officer of Mr. Flake’s Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York and Mr. Flake’s executive staff director when he served in Congress.

Mr. Flake, however, said that he had no involvement with New Directions. He said that he was unaware that federal authorities were investigating Aqueduct Entertainment Group, and that he did not know why they would.

One of the partners of Aqueduct Entertainment Group, Jeffrey Levine, said in a statement, “We are unaware of any investigation and have not been contacted by any law enforcement or regulator agency of any kind.”

Ken Frydman, a spokesman for the company, said there was no relationship between Aqueduct Entertainment Group and Mr. Reed.

Mr. Reed declined to comment on Wednesday night. Austin Shafran, a spokesman for Mr. Smith, the Senate president, sought last night to play down the senator’s hiring of Mr. Stuart, the former prosecutor. He said Mr. Smith had hired Mr. Stuart to work part time and that Mr. Stuart did not stay on the state payroll long, leaving for another job, although Mr. Shafran was unable to say what it was.

He said that, because the Senate offices were closed, he could not say precisely when Mr. Stuart started, when he left, how many hours he worked or how much he was paid.

Asked whether the fired prosecutor had special skills or whether there was another reason why Mr. Smith had hired him, Mr. Shafran said, “Senator Smith hired Mr. Stuart to serve as a constituent liaison as someone who had an intimate knowledge of community affairs and could be beneficial to his district office.”

A telephone message left for Mr. Stuart with a family member was not returned, and efforts to reach him through an associate were unsuccessful.

Congressman Meeks said through an aide, “I believe in transparency, so to the extent that there is an investigation, like everybody else, I look forward to a clear presentation of the facts.”

Another employee of Senator Smith’s was also on the board of New Directions. His counsel, Mortimer Lawrence, was listed as the group’s chairman on its 2003 tax return.

A man who answered the telephone at the Long Island accounting firm that prepared New Direction’s tax returns, but declined to identify himself, said he gave federal authorities “all the records I had in my office.” He added, “All I did was prepare the returns and that was it.”
1256 2010-02-11 HONG KONG — A court in Beijing on Thursday denied an appeal by one of China’s best-known democracy advocates and upheld his 11-year prison sentence, human rights activists said.

The Beijing Municipal Higher People’s Court upheld the conviction and unusually harsh sentence of Liu Xiaobo, a Beijing scholar who played an important role in organizing Charter 08, a document issued by him and other intellectuals in December 2008 that called for political and legal reforms. Mr. Liu was convicted of “inciting subversion of state power.”

Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the United States ambassador to China, quickly denounced the verdict. “We believe that he should not have been sentenced in the first place and should be released immediately,” he said in a statement.
1257 2010-02-11 The plot thickens again for the American International Group bailout. The rescued insurer is in discussions to sell its American Life Insurance, or Alico, unit to MetLife. But A.I.G. might get MetLife stock as part of the potential $15 billion deal. As a result, the government could end up owning stock in yet another company, bringing further delay and uncertainty to the bailout repayment effort.

In one of the iterations of the bailout, in which the government committed more than $180 billion, the New York Federal Reserve converted $9 billion of debt A.I.G. owed into a preferred equity interest in Alico.

A sale of the unit was supposed to send those billions winging their way back to taxpayers in cash. Now that’s not so clear. MetLife might pay A.I.G. partly in stock. That means part of the New York Fed’s Alico investment could be replaced with a stake in MetLife. Even if there was enough cash for A.I.G. to pay $9 billion to the New York Fed, the government-controlled A.I.G. would still be left holding some of its rival’s stock.

Companies that sell businesses do sometimes accept some of the buyer’s stock as part of the price paid. And A.I.G. needs to sell Alico to advance its plan to repay its bailout. But it’s not ideal at the best of times, and in this case it muddies the whole A.I.G. picture.

If the New York Fed or A.I.G. end up with MetLife stock, it will probably not be allowed to sell it for months. So the Alico sale would, at least for part of its value, achieve the replacement of one illiquid equity stake only with another — in a company the government doesn’t need to own.

Of course, MetLife’s stock could go up in value and bring more for taxpayers in the end. And the deal would still probably be a quicker exit for A.I.G. than trying to float Alico, which would initially raise only a small amount of cash. Another option might be to accept a slightly lower price if MetLife were able to sell more stock to public investors and pay A.I.G. entirely in cash. Whatever happens in the end, it’s a salutary example of the unforeseen wrinkles once governments start rescuing private companies.
1258 2010-02-11 HONG KONG — The rate of inflation at factories and other producers more than doubled last month in China, with producer prices climbing at the fastest pace in 15 months while the money supply continued to grow briskly.

The sudden acceleration partly reflects the low level of commodity prices a year ago during the depths of the global financial crisis, said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

But the acceleration in prices at the factory gate was also the latest indication that China might be forced to continue tightening controls on bank lending, economists said.

The Chinese government typically does that through some combination of administrative controls on the volume of bank loans as well as higher interest rates for bills issued by the central bank.

Producer prices were up 4.3 percent in January from a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday morning. In December, the increase from a year earlier was just 1.9 percent.

As recently as October, China was still experiencing gradual deflation at the producer level.

However, consumer prices were up 1.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with a year-over-year increase of 1.9 percent in December, in a sign that factories and stores had not yet tried to pass on increases to retail customers.

A broad measure of money supply, M2, grew 26 percent in January from a year earlier, China’s central bank announced separately on Thursday.
1259 2010-02-11 During the NBC coverage of the Olympics, Procter will introduce what it calls its first corporate image campaign for the United States. “This is a world-class event,” Mr. Pritchard said, “and we want to do some world-class brand building.”

The campaign, which carries the theme “Thanks, Mom,” is being created by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. The ads promote Procter as a company that is a “proud sponsor of moms,” helping the mothers who help Olympic athletes — and all children — do their best.

In one commercial, viewers see the athletes the way their mothers still see them, as boys and girls. Another spot, set to the song “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” shows mothers performing prosaic, though important, tasks for their children.

“We tried to avoid getting overly cheesy and Hallmark-y,” said Jason Bagley, a creative director at Wieden & Kennedy. “We wanted to capture that emotion without going over the top.”

Dozens of advertisers will present emotional commercials, among them Visa, which is feting the Winter Games in a campaign to run in 21 countries from the Los Angeles office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group.

“There is a need for inspiration” because of economic conditions, said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing officer at Visa in San Francisco, “and the campaign celebrates human achievement.”

At the same time, the economy mandates “a greater focus on value,” he added, so the campaign, which carries the theme “Go world,” will include promotions like a contest to win tickets to the Winter Games for life.

Mr. Lucio declined to predict “what the audiences are going to be like” for the coverage of the Olympics, but with “a lot more people spending time at home,” he said, there could be robust ratings.

“I can hope for a U.S.-Canada hockey final,” he added, laughing.

Katie Bayne, chief marketing officer at Coca-Cola North America in Atlanta, suggested another possible audience builder.

“All this snow’s going to help me,” she said of the recent bad weather in major markets. “Everyone’s stuck inside after they bought enough food and enough Coke to last a month.”

The Coca-Cola campaign will be extensive, as usual, befitting a company that has for decades been a sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. The initiative will branch beyond TV with a focus on digital and social media, including themed content on Web sites like mycoke.com and mycokerewards.com; a presence on Facebook; and a light-hearted campaign online, centered on a make-believe International Federation of Snowball Throwing (snowballthrowing.com).

Another appeal of the Olympics is a belief that it “aligns with our values,” said Daryl Evans, vice president for consumer advertising and marketing communications at the Atlanta office of AT&T, a sponsor of Team USA for more than 20 years.

“We certainly want to be in large events because they give us broad exposure,” he said, but an added value is “athletes trying to push the boundaries,” which he compared to AT&T’s “trying to push the technology boundaries so people can live their everyday lives a little better.”

The AT&T Olympic campaign carries the theme “Here’s to possibilities.” It was created by the Atlanta and New York offices of another Omnicom agency, BBDO Worldwide. There will also be interactive aspects, like a Web portal where fans can post messages for their favorite athletes.

Another BBDO agency, Juniper Park in Toronto, is creating a campaign for SunChips, sold by the Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo. It will introduce what Frito-Lay says is the first 100 percent compostable snack-chip bag made from plants, which will be phased in during the next year.

“We’re new to the Olympics,” said Gannon Jones, vice president for portfolio marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex. “We targeted the Games to launch this news for us because we think it’s an ideal stage.”

One reason is the location, Vancouver, British Columbia, Mr. Jones said, which means the Games will take place “in a good time zone” for American viewers.

“You don’t get the tape-delay hangover,” he added, referring to the declines in viewership when Olympic events are shown later rather than shown live.

Frito-Lay is one of many marketers buying commercials during coverage of the Winter Games but not official sponsors. Another is Liberty Mutual, which will run spots created by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

“There is obviously strong brand association with advertising during the Winter Olympics,” said Greg Winter, a vice president at Hill, Holliday, because the athletes demonstrate “strength, determination and honor.”
1260 2010-02-11 MOSCOW — How do Russians view the visa process with the European Union? The New York Times posted that question to a Russian blog about visa issues on livejournal.com. Here are some of their responses, translated by the Moscow bureau of The Times.

“Visas are demeaning. In consulates, Russians are treated like scum. For them we are just potential illegal immigrants, prostitutes or criminals. I don’t see the point of even going to Europe, being treated like that.” Haktarr

“The visa regime is not the most insurmountable barrier in the lives of the Russian citizen. Personally, I approach the issue patiently, like ‘one of...’ in a series of unpleasant, though solvable problems. Of course, it would be better without this, but it already exists. Moreover, the period when it was considered demeaning has already passed. Now it has just become mechanical, like the relationship of a couple long-married.” Bussov

“I really suffer from the visa regime with Europe, and think that it is about time to repeal it (on a bilateral basis, of course). If not for this, I would have gone to Europe far more frequently. You have to run around gathering documents, demanding faxes from hotels (for many embassies) and strictly follow the expiration date on the visa. But I don’t think the visa regime will be repealed anytime soon. Too bad.” Purple_files

“Because of the visa regime, I have never gone to Europe. When I wanted to, my visa did not come in on time. Without visas, I would have already gone on a couple of trips a long time ago. It’s irritating because normally the process is so slow, there is a ton of paperwork and you get stressed filling it all out.” Naumec

“I don’t think that the visa regime between Russia and the European Union should be repealed. For the E.U. this would be too risky. But the procedure could be simplified with the addition of a little common sense. If in principle E.U. countries are prepared to allow Russian citizens to enter their territory, then why do there have to be these strict entry and exit dates, or demands for proof that hotels have been reserved? It would be great to just hand in once a year or two or three all the necessary documents and receive a long-term multiple-entry visa.” Crooked_pony

“There are few consulates, and Russia is large. Not many can afford to fly all around for the sake of one little piece of paper. And gathering bills, proof of employment, hotel reservations, plus a letter from the hotel to the consulate is pretty dreary and frequently impossible to complete. Thankfully, a doctor’s note isn’t required. How can we get rid of these visas? We would have the ability to vacation like you, normal people.” Labuka
1261 2010-02-11 A rare study that tracked thousands of children through adulthood found the heaviest youngsters were more than twice as likely as the thinnest to die prematurely, before age 55, of illness or a self-inflicted injury.

Youngsters with a condition called pre-diabetes were at almost double the risk of dying before 55, and those with high blood pressure were at some increased risk. But obesity was the factor most closely associated with an early death, researchers said.

The study, published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed data gathered from Pima and Tohono O’odham Indians, whose rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes soared decades before weight problems became widespread among other Americans. It is one of the largest studies to have tracked children for several decades after detailed information on weight and risk factors like high cholesterol were gathered.

“This suggests,” said Helen C. Looker, senior author of the paper and assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, “that obesity in children, even prepubescent children, may have very serious long-term health effects through midlife — that there is something serious being set in motion by obesity at early ages.” Dr. Looker added, “We all expect to get beyond 55 these days.”

Nearly one in three American children is now considered to be either overweight or obese, and this week, the first lady, Michelle Obama, kicked off a campaign intended to end childhood obesity.
1262 2010-02-11 Predicting the behavior of consumers is always tricky. In the case of e-books, publishers are hoping that a vast majority of people who have not yet tried e-reading devices will not have any expectation of the low pricing now available from Amazon and others, including Barnes & Noble and Sony. They argue that new e-book shoppers will welcome the chance to buy digital editions at a level significantly lower than the typical price tag on a hardcover book.

“With the iPad, the whole notion of e-book reading is probably going to become way more mainstream than it ever has,” said Harvey Chute, who runs KindleBoards, a popular discussion forum for readers of electronic books. “And a majority of people may be coming to it new, and may only see that they are getting $7 off the price they would see at a bookstore.”

But some e-book buyers say that since publishers do not have to pay to print, store or distribute e-books, they should be much cheaper than print books.

“I just don’t want to be extorted,” said Joshua Levitsky, a computer technician and Kindle owner in New York. “I want to pay what it’s worth. If it costs them nothing to print the paper book, which I can’t believe, then they should be the same price. But I just don’t see how it can be the same price.”

Just what e-books are worth is a matter of debate. Publishers argue that printing and distribution represents a small proportion of the total cost of making a book.

“There are people who don’t always understand what goes into an author writing and an editor editing and a publishing house with hundreds of men and women working on these books,” said Mark Gompertz, executive vice president of digital publishing at Simon & Schuster. “If you want something that has no quality to it, fine, but we’re out to bring out things of quality, regardless of what type of book it is.”

To consumers who do not pay much attention to the economics of publishing, though, such arguments are trumped by the fact that e-books have been available for $9.99 for more than a year.

“As far as I’m concerned, Amazon has committed to the $9.99 price,” said Wilma Sanders, a 70-year-old retiree who has homes in Plymouth, Mass., and Marco Island, Fla. She said that if e-book prices rose, she would stop buying. “I’m still a library-goer. There are enough good books out there that I don’t need to pay more than I want to. I already can’t keep up with what I have.”

Authors have been taken aback by some of the vehemence of the reader protests.

“The sense of entitlement of the American consumer is absolutely astonishing,” said Douglas Preston, whose novel “Impact” reached as high as No. 4 on The New York Times’s hardcover fiction best-seller list earlier this month. “It’s the Wal-Mart mentality, which in my view is very unhealthy for our country. It’s this notion of not wanting to pay the real price of something.”

Amazon commenters attacked Mr. Preston after his publisher delayed the e-book version of his novel by four months to protect hardcover sales. Mr. Preston said he was not sure whether the protests were denting his sales. But, he said, “It gives me pause when I get 50 e-mails saying ‘I’m never buying one of your books ever again. I’m moving on, you greedy, greedy author.”‘

One reason consumers may be sensitive to pricing is that they have so many other types of entertainment to occupy their time.

“Entertainment and media companies keep forgetting that consumers have a choice. They can decide not to buy the book at all,” said David Pakman, a venture capitalist and former chief executive of the digital music store eMusic. “They can play a video game, use an iPod Touch.” He added: “If you don’t get the price tag right and make it convenient, they just go elsewhere.”

John Wagoner, a 63-year-old accountant and Kindle owner in Plano, Tex., said that if e-book prices went much higher than $13 he would simply commit his time and dollars to other activities.

“They’re just books,” said Mr. Wagoner, who left an angry one-star review on the Amazon page for Mr. Preston’s novel. “I do other things other than reading.”

Some analysts say that if consumers balk at price increases, piracy could grow rapidly.

Joel Waldfogel, a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, saw a comparison with movies, a business where he has studied digital piracy rates. With movies, he said, piracy tends to displace paid consumption. “The real cost of consuming a movie is the two hours of undivided attention you spend,” Mr. Waldfogel said. “If people are able to steal a bunch more, they will purchase less, simply because there isn’t time to do all of it.”

Similarly, with books, he said, “I would be scared to death about a culture of piracy taking hold. I wouldn’t mess around with price increases.”

Publishers say price levels are not settled by any means and that now, having reached agreements where publishers — rather than retailers — set consumer prices, they have an opportunity to test different situations.

“We may introduce a book at $14.95 for a year and then move the book to $9.99 when we would have put out the trade paperback edition,” said Dominique Raccah, chief executive of Sourcebooks, an independent publisher. “I suspect you’re going to see a fair amount of experimentation.”

Some e-book buyers are not interested in experiments. Mr. Fogel, who left the one-star review of the Kindle edition of Ms. Coulter’s novel, said he would not pay more than $9.99 for a book.

“There are too many very, very good books I haven’t gotten around to reading yet,” said Mr. Fogel, a 68-year-old retired management consultant. He added that publishers were likely to see “supply and demand turn back on them.”

“I think there’s going to be a general resentment” of higher prices, he said.
1263 2010-02-11 “I don’t know,” said Goosen, a former United States Open winner. “Twenty, but why 50?”

Referring to Tiger Woods, Goosen added: “Maybe they want to see Woods hit into that green. It all depends on conditions. They can’t use it if it’s playing into the wind.”

The U.S.G.A. may decide not to use the tees at all, or to use them every day. This is all part of the mystery when players visit a course that will host the Open. Those like Goosen and Paul Casey, who are using some of their time evaluating the changes, are also tuning their games for the AT&T. Every Open winner at Pebble Beach — Jack Nicklaus in 1972, Tom Watson in 1982, Tom Kite in 1992 and Tiger Woods in 2000 — has also won the AT&T.

Brad Faxon, a tour veteran and course architect who recently joined the NBC broadcast team, said he mostly liked the changes at Pebble Beach, but first raved about the work done at Monterey Peninsula.

“I think it’s the best renovation I’ve ever seen, anywhere,” said Faxon, whose own work with the architect Gil Hanse at the TPC Boston has received good reviews. “I think he absolutely nailed it, a seaside course with everything you would want to have,” referring to Mike Strantz, who redesigned the course.

And although Faxon had not seen all of the changes to Pebble Beach — a list that includes the addition of tees to lengthen Nos. 3, 9, 10 and 13 — he said the course had been strengthened and would be “a worthy U.S. Open challenge.”

“Certainly the conditions will be very different in June, I would hope,” he said. “You’ll see a lot more rough. We have seen a few added bunkers on holes like 2, and they changed the bunkering there on 6.”

The bunkering at the uphill, par-five No. 6 has been moved in to pinch the landing area, which will force players to make a decision whether to even use a driver. The rough on the right side of the hole also will be shaved down, to bring the cliff and the ocean into play.

At the short par-four No. 4, some pot bunkers have been added in the fairway drive zone.

“It is a huge difference now,” Faxon said. “That’s become a very tough driving hole and a hole you used to just hit it as hard as you can.”

The large boulder atop a hillock at No. 8, which once served as an aiming point for the blind shot to the fairway, has been removed, to the displeasure of some players, and the fairway has been tightened.

Donald, who last played here in 2007, is withholding judgment on the changes, content mainly to use his time this week to calculate adjustments to whatever differences there are.

“I’m not sure I’ll learn too much,” Donald said. “Obviously it’s more about just familiarizing myself again with the course. I think certain shots will play similar. But over all, the course will be firmer with more rough and the greens will be firmer and faster.”

Chuck Dunbar, the head golf professional at Pebble Beach, will be listening closely to the players’ comments this week. He said many of the alterations, while taxing the pros, will not affect resort guests — who will pay nearly $500 to play Pebble Beach.

“Whatever changes we make, we do so with our resort guests in mind, first and foremost,” Dunbar said. “They are our core business.”
1264 2010-02-11 It has been nearly a year since S. C. Johnson & Son, the maker of products like Windex, Glade and Drano, agreed to begin disclosing all the ingredients in its home-cleaning and air-care products sold in the United States, giving consumers unprecedented access to information about the chemicals they squirt and spray throughout their homes. And earlier this month, a lawsuit brought by a consortium of health and environmental groups with the aim of forcing other household cleaning-product manufacturers (like Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive) to do the same, inched closer to resolution when a New York State Supreme Court judge announced at a hearing that he will soon rule on whether the case can move forward.

In the wake of all this, Seventh Generation, a company that has made nontoxic cleaners for more than 20 years, is rolling out its first collection of disinfecting products made with thymol, a component of the oil derived from thyme. The products — wipes, a multisurface spray and a bathroom spray — kill germs (including viruses like Influenza A and H1N1) just like other disinfectants but are safe enough that the Environmental Protection Agency allows them to be sold without lengthy first-aid warnings on the labels.

Perhaps the biggest game-changer, though, is Martha Stewart’s first line of cleaning products, which have no added fragrances or artificial colors. Although many Americans have grown to like and even favor products that smell like chemicals or have artificial scents, Ms. Stewart said she wants consumers “to break that habit,” and trust that the absence of a smell can indicate clean. “If you can start eliminating some of the harshness that surrounds us on our planet and get back to nature, that’s what I’m all about,” she said, explaining that she had to “fight against focus groups” to get the products made the way she wanted.

The new Seventh Generation disinfecting products are available nationwide at select retail and grocery stores, starting at about $3 for the 26-ounce multisurface cleaner. Martha Stewart Clean’s 10 new products are sold on amazon.com and at Home Depot and Giant Eagle stores, starting at about $4 for the 17-ounce dish and hand soap.

1265 2010-02-11 Last April, Ivor van Heerden, an internationally known hurricane expert, was told he was losing his job at Louisiana State University. He and other experts said it was because of his outspoken criticism of the federal government’s flood protection of New Orleans; the university would not comment.

Now Dr. van Heerden, the former deputy director of the L.S.U. Hurricane Center, is suing the university to get his job back. His lawyers filed a lawsuit in Louisiana state court on Wednesday morning, charging harassment and wrongful termination.

Dr. van Heerden, who was born in South Africa, joined L.S.U. in 1992 and rose to prominence as an expert on storms and the region, becoming a research professor and director of the Center for the Study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes.

In the years before Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, he sounded alarms about the potentially devastating impact of a major storm on New Orleans despite 40 years of hurricane protection efforts.

After the storm, he vehemently criticized the Army Corps of Engineers on television and in print, arguing that engineering mistakes had caused breaches in the hurricane protection system that led to most of the death and destruction in New Orleans.

State officials named him to lead Team Louisiana, an investigation into the causes of the damage from the storm. At the university, however, Dr. van Heerden’s growing profile as an antigovernment gadfly was seen as a problem. One university official sent him an e-mail message, obtained by The New York Times, saying that he needed to help the state’s recovery, not point blame.

1290 2010-02-12 WASHINGTON — Before leaving for the Presidents’ Day break, the Senate on Thursday night confirmed — by unanimous consent — more than two dozen of President Obama’s nominees to federal positions.

Mr. Obama and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, had warned this week that the president might use the weeklong holiday break to make recess appointments, a threat underscoring his frustration with months of delays in confirming some key nominees.

Also this week, Republicans blocked the confirmation of Craig Becker, a labor lawyer, to a seat on the National Labor Relations Board, which has been operating with only two of its five members for a few years. At an impromptu news conference, just before a procedural vote on Mr. Becker, Mr. Obama complained that he wanted Republicans to stop holding up his nominees.

In a statement on Thursday night, the president described the confirmations as “a good first step” and seemed to signal he would not be making recess appointments anytime soon.

But Mr. Obama’s statement added: “There are still dozens of nominees on hold who deserve a similar vote, and I will be looking for action from the Senate when it returns from recess. If they do not act, I reserve the right to use my recess appointment authority in the future.”

The nominees confirmed Thursday night included Charles Collyns, deputy under secretary at the Treasury Department; Marisa Lago and Mary John Miller, assistant Treasury secretaries; Caryn Wagner, assistant secretary of homeland security; Dr. Robert A. Petzel, under secretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs; Mary Sally Matiella, assistant secretary of the Army; Douglas B. Wilson, an assistant secretary of defense; and Ellen Gloninger Murray, assistant secretary of health and human services.
1291 2010-02-12 WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said Thursday that talks over a bipartisan bill to overhaul the nation’s financial regulations had resumed, but the outcome of a major point of contention — whether to create an independent consumer agency to regulate financial products like credit cards and mortgages — remained unclear.

The chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said last week that he had reached an “impasse” after months of discussions with the senior Republican on the committee, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama.

Mr. Dodd said he would tell his staff to press ahead on drafting legislation, even without Republican support.

But on Thursday, Mr. Dodd said he had resumed talks, this time with another Republican on the committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee.

“I called him Tuesday night and asked him to negotiate the financial reform bill with me,” Mr. Dodd said in a statement. “We met in my office on Wednesday and given the importance of these issues, he agreed.”
1292 2010-02-12 That night, Mr. Myint featured small plates of chicken-fried beef jerky ($7), and Mr. Halvorson made gnocchi with Himalayan truffles ($8).

By taking advantage of underused kitchens, pop-ups allow young chefs, many with experience in San Francisco’s most highly regarded restaurants, to experiment without the risk of bankruptcy. And unlike underground supper clubs, they’re completely legal.

“We just started with our own money,” said Mark Bright, a sommelier who, along with the chef Joshua Skenes, runs Saison, a Friday through Sunday restaurant that operates out of a commercial kitchen behind Stable Café on Folsom Street (2124 Folsom Street near 17th Street, (415) 828-7990, saisonsf.com, reservations required). They started within two weeks of finding the space last July.

“Even in this economic climate people are really out there trying to make things happen,” said Mr. Halvorson, who also runs a pop-up called EAT on Monday at 111 Minna, a SOMA art gallery (111 Minna Street at Second Street, (415) 375-2321, eatat111minna.blogspot.com). “Instead of crying because the bank won’t give me $2 million to open a restaurant,” he said, “this is a way I can do it.”

The most venerable of the lot might be Radio Africa & Kitchen, operated Thursday and Friday nights at Coffee Bar, a stylish cafe in the Mission (1890 Bryant Street at the corner of Florida and Mariposa Streets, (415) 420-2486, radioafricakitchen.com). Eskender Aseged has been cooking what he calls “Red Sea meets Mediterranean” for small gatherings since he came to the United States from his native Ethiopia more than two decades ago. When Coffee Bar opened three years ago, the owner invited Mr. Aseged to open Radio Africa & Kitchen there. (Coffee Bar also hosts another, more sporadic pop-up called Jet Set Chef — thejetsetchef.com.)

Mr. Aseged hopes one day to open his own restaurant, but he is in no hurry. A recent menu featured Tanzanian-style octopus ($18) and roasted leg of lamb with berbere sauce ($18).

A more casual pop-up is Pal’s Takeaway, a counter inside a corner store that offers a few carefully considered sandwiches each day for lunch. Though it is invisible from the street, Pal’s consistently draws crowds for things like five-spice roasted chicken sandwiches ($8) and homemade pickled vegetables ($4). (Inside Tony’s Market, 2751 24th Street at Hampshire Street, (415) 203-4911, palstakeaway.com)

Flexibility keeps these chefs loyal to the pop-up concept. Mr.Myint says his primary motivation is to use food to raise money for various causes. Thus far, Mission Street Food has had more than 60 guest chefs and, in 2009, contributed $22,000 to charities.

Last year Mr. Myint, whose brawny hands are covered in the burns and scars of his six years as a cook, also started Mission Burger, which serves juicy, sloppy burgers from the grill at Duc Loi, a Vietnamese supermarket ($8, which includes a dollar for charity, 2200 Mission Street at 18th Street, (415) 551-1772). Now he works seven days a week.

At Saison, Mr. Skenes wanted to be able to riff on each week’s best available ingredients, which means spending Mondays and Tuesdays calling farmers and suppliers and combing markets, then creating a seven- to eight-course prix fixe menu ($80, plus $50 for wine). Recent menu items include poularde in almond milk and flights of fish with hojiblanca olive oil. He also serves a $180 10- to 12-course meal (plus $60 for wine) for two or four people each night at the chef’s table, nestled in the center of the action between the stoves and the walk-in freezer.

For his part, Mr. Myint is exploring a permanent restaurant, but he is seeking money in a manner true to the scrappy pop-up ethos: at the start of the month he announced on his blog that he’s looking for 100 people to invest $500 each. “There has been kind of a lot of response,” he said.
1293 2010-02-12 Under his direction, the trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, backed up its end of the deal by spending more than $100 million on ads to promote the overhaul.

But after the reform stalled, some industry leaders felt the trade group had gone too far giving concessions and could lose on some important legislative issues without gaining the political protection it had sought.

The nature of the group’s deal with the White House was initially undisclosed by Mr. Tauzin and the Obama administration. But when Congressional liberals began to press to take more out of the industry — potentially by allowing importation of cheaper drugs from Canada or decreasing the industry’s years of exclusive rights to biological drugs — Mr. Tauzin publicly accused the White House of failing to hold up its end of a quid pro quo.

The arrangement, confirmed by a White House official and later in Congress, became a source of controversy among liberals who faulted the administration for giving away too much and Republicans who had traditionally been supported by the pharmaceutical industry.

In an interview with The New York Times in July, Mr. Tauzin said, “Our goal, I described it almost five years ago when I took over, has been to end this business of PhRMA having enemies. Disease was our only enemy. And to have a nonpartisan organization. And we got there just in time.”

With Mr. Tauzin in charge, the trade group donated more money to Democrats running for office and added former Democratic officials to its lobbying forces.

Mr. Tauzin later said the White House had asked him to negotiate over the health care overhaul because, “They wanted a big player to come in and set the bar for everybody else.”

“We were assured: ‘We need somebody to come in first. If you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal,’ ” he added. And, under pressure from his own board, he warned the White House not to back away.

Kathleen Jaeger, president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, which sometimes crossed swords with PhRMA, was surprised Thursday when informed of Mr. Tauzin’s plans to resign. “He has done a fantastic job for the brand pharmaceutical industry,” she said. “Billy is a master of politics and policy.”

Officials for the White House declined to comment.

Christopher A. Viehbacher, a board member of PhRMA and chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis, said in an interview on Wednesday that he still held hope the health care package could pass Congress. “The most important thing to me in this whole process is that PhRMA was not the bad guy,” he said, adding, “It has not been without its political cost because it is actually difficult to be bipartisan in all of this.”

Mr. Tauzin was a House representative for Louisiana for a quarter-century, first as a Democrat and then after switching to the Republican Party in 1995. He served as chairman of the House Commerce Committee when it recommended expanding drug benefits to older Medicare recipients.

Leaving for the PhRMA job after that, Mr. Tauzin drew some criticism for his Medicare work in Congress, but he insisted the PhRMA job had not been offered to him until he had decided to leave Congress and accepted another job, with the motion picture trade association.

Mr. Tauzin announced his new job and left the House with a year left in his term. In 2007, the Democrats added a new provision to the House ethics code known as the Tauzin rule, which specifically bars a lawmaker from negotiating deals for future employment while still on the job.

Mr. Tauzin said he took the PhRMA job after he learned he was diagnosed with cancer.

In the PhRMA statement, he said, “In January 2005, after a full year successfully battling a killer cancer, I was given a second chance at life, and appropriately chose to commit my next five years to the lifesaving work of the people whose miracle medicines had just saved my own.” He said he was leaving after fulfilling his five and a half year commitment to the job.
1294 2010-02-12 News of Mr. Cohen’s troubles, which led to his resignation from the Democratic ballot on Sunday, reached Mr. Schoeneman late last week during a layover at the Minneapolis airport as he returned from a vacation in the Philippines. Mr. Schoeneman recalled that the last time he had vacationed out of the country, state and local police in Evanston announced the arrests of 30 individuals in connection with an undercover pawnshop sting.

Aside from the Evanston arrests, Mr. Schoeneman said, the pawnbrokering industry in Illinois had had little to fear from bad headlines — until now.

“The pawn industry has a roundly undeserved bad reputation,” he said. “Any time there is anything negative in the press, we roll our eyes and say, ‘Oh jeez, just what we need.’ ”

Pawnshops have labored for decades to shake off a stubborn reputation for shadiness and desperation, codified in popular culture, like in the 1964 film “The Pawnbroker.”

The industry contends that it provides a necessary service in offering secured loans, but critics say it takes advantage of people in vulnerable financial situations by charging extraordinarily high interest. The police say, too, that unscrupulous pawnbrokers provide an outlet that makes it easy for thieves and burglars to fence stolen goods.

Even before Mr. Cohen bowed out of the race during halftime of the Super Bowl, Dave Crume, president of the National Pawnbrokers Association, put out a statement criticizing the news media for routinely invoking Mr. Cohen’s profession, “as a negative connotation to discredit Mr. Cohen and to sway public opinion for the benefit of an important political race.”

Baxter Swilley, Mr. Cohen’s spokesman, also took issue with the characterization. Mr. Cohen made most of his money in real estate, and the pawnshop was simply “the most sensational component of his identity,” Mr. Swilley said.

Mr. Cohen’s campaign has blamed media disclosures about the abuse accusation and his former use of steroids for forcing him out of the race for lieutenant governor. Once Mr. Cohen’s troubles came to light, he said this week, the Democratic Party leadership was eager to slot a longtime politician onto the ballot rather than an outsider like him.

Mr. Cohen’s fellow pawnbrokers do not appreciate the steady stream of slights they have taken because of his campaign.

“Every time I heard it, I felt like spitting,” said Steve Greenfield, owner of Jewels by Stephanie in downtown Chicago, which has been in his family since his grandfather bought the store in 1918.

As evidence of the industry’s responsible side, Mr. Greenfield notes the heavy regulation of pawnshops, which must comply with numerous federal laws, including the USA Patriot Act. In Illinois, the Pawnbroker Regulation Act governs the state’s approximately 225 stores.

Mr. Cohen’s pawnshop, State Pawners & Jewelers, based on South Ashland Avenue, has caused considerably less of a stir than his brief political career. .

“His shop is a paid member in good standing of the Illinois Pawnbrokers Association,” said Mr. Schoeneman, who had dinner with Mr. Cohen a few months ago but has not spoken to him since the political scandal broke. “I have no qualms with his business.”

“I am sorry for him to have to go through all of that,” Mr. Schoeneman said, “but that having been said, it is what it is and he did what he had to do.”

Joe Brooks, owner of T.N. Donnelly and Company, Chicago’s oldest pawnshop, said he thought that the industry had begun to turn the corner on its shady reputation.

“We thought so, until somebody got their name into the paper,” Mr. Brooks said. “We have been trying our best to project ourselves as something other than that, and apparently it didn’t get there. The message didn’t get out.”

“I don’t know any pawnbrokers sitting in jail,” he added, “but I know a couple of governors and aldermen. If anything, ‘politician’ should be a dirtier word than ‘pawnbroker.’ ”
1295 2010-02-12 LOS ANGELES — Decades ago, Howard Hughes bought a bunch of land behind the world-famous Hollywood sign with the intent of ensconcing his lover Ginger Rogers in a mansion in its hilltop shadow.

She never cottoned to the idea, though, and Hughes more or less forgot about his purchase, leaving the land near the sign to tourists, hikers and Hollywood history seekers. Development never came.

Now, in an effort to see that it never does, a preservation group has teamed with a city councilman to quickly raise the balance of the $11.7 million needed to buy the land from a Chicago developer that acquired it from a Hughes trust and to turn it over to a local park.

To make their case, they began on Thursday to drape the sign with a banner that will read “Save the Peak” in the hope that a day or two without their most recognized civic symbol will entice Los Angelenos to donate the final $5 million needed by spring to keep mansions from dotting the ridge line around it.

“This is, for us, like the Statue of Liberty in New York or the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco,” said Tom LaBonge, a councilman whose district includes the section of Hollywood with the sign. “People land at LAX and they want to see the Hollywood sign. If that mountain that surrounds it were filled with mansions, it would ruin the view and ruin the free spirit of Los Angeles.”

The fight to keep the Hollywood sign unobstructed reflects a polygamous marriage of topics that obsess Los Angelenos — public space, billboards and the city’s young but storied history. (There seems to be no traffic angle, but just wait.)
1296 2010-02-12 How you feel about the odd little documentary “Barefoot to Timbuktu” will depend to an unusually large extent on how you feel about its subject, a Swiss-American artist named Ernst Aebi, who made a killing in SoHo and TriBeCa real estate and has spent much of the time since as a globe-trotting “adventurer.” The director Martina Egi, a Swiss television producer making her first feature film, isn’t reverent toward Mr. Aebi. (She gives screen time to people whose feelings are clearly mixed.) But neither is she critical. She manages the neat trick, intentional or not, of shaping no point of view whatsoever, leaving us to choose along a spectrum that, based on the evidence here, could run from charismatic Renaissance man to tyrannical narcissist.

The film is ostensibly about Mr. Aebi’s visit in 1989 to Araouane, a settlement even deeper in the Sahara than Timbuktu. He stayed three years, bankrolling and supervising the improvement of wells, the planting of elaborate gardens and the construction of a small tourist hotel. Then fighting between Tuareg rebels and the Malian government forced him to leave.

The film builds to Mr. Aebi’s return two decades later, but along the way most of its time is spent in discussion of his life and work. Interviewees include two brothers in Switzerland, who seem proud but not particularly impressed, and several daughters, including the one he pushed into sailing solo around the world at the age of 18. Ms. Egi has called the film’s ending, in which Mr. Aebi arrives back in Araouane, “surprising not only to the protagonist, but also the audience.” For anyone who’s actually paying attention, it looks sadly inevitable.

Directed by Martina Egi; written by Ms. Egi and Beat Hirt; directors of photography, Frank Messmer and Bill Rosser; edited by Christian Müller; music by Fatima Dunn and Nico Contesse; produced by Bob Marty; released by MPI Media Productions. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. In English, French, German, Sorai and Arabic, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes. This film is not rated.
1297 2010-02-12 Joe Maneri, who died last August, was the sort of musician who leaves a deep and tangled impression. During his 37-year teaching career at the New England Conservatory in Boston — and a longer but more intermittent run as a multireedist and composer — he put his stamp on generations of improvisers, along with some perplexedly enchanted audiences.

White-bearded and jovial, he had a demeanor that fell somewhere between wizardly and impish. He could make any performance feel strange and special, unrepeatable.

That’s probably a reason for the sting of his absence, still, among those who knew him well. It was surely a reason for the poignancy of a three-hour tribute at the Irondale Center in Brooklyn on Tuesday night, what would have been his 83rd birthday.

It was a family affair. Mr. Maneri’s widow, Sonja, spoke touchingly, and each of his three sons made musical contributions. Sal, the oldest, sang “A Prelude to a Kiss” in a disarming baritone croon; Abe, the youngest, played a broken hymn on electric piano. (We’ll get to Mat.)

There were testimonials from former students and fellow players, most of them recalling the moment they met Mr. Maneri as if relating a conversion narrative.
1298 2010-02-12 Although it has its share of lovey-dovey moments, “This Thing Called Love,” Eric Comstock and Barbara Fasano’s Valentine’s Day show at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel does not succumb to the usual seasonal clichés of throbbing hearts and flowers and kissy-poo cuteness. The program is a witty, his-and-hers exploration of romantic chemistry by a couple whose musical portrayal of their five-year marriage goes out of its way to celebrate each partner’s individuality.

A suave bistro performer in the Bobby Short mold, Mr. Comstock is so at ease at the keyboard that his pop-jazz pianism and understated vocals fuse into a civilized, erudite musical stream of consciousness, which at Tuesday’s opening night show was ably abetted by Sean Smith on bass. Even a song like “Tonight,” from “West Side Story,” that is usually done operatically, was toned down so that you could actually consider the words.

Ms. Fasano might be described as a friendly Lena Horne. She has many of Ms. Horne’s mannerisms but not her hauteur and seething anger. If Mr. Comstock shuns melodrama, Ms. Fasano allows just a little. At once anxious and dreamy, her rendition of “Joey, Joey, Joey,” from “The Most Happy Fella,” evoked premarital wanderlust and youthful naïveté that are a subtheme of the show.

Mr. Comstock joked that while he was growing up in the “mayonnaise belt” of northern New Jersey his junior high school years were lonely because his peers didn’t share his precocious enthusiasm for Mr. Short, Mabel Mercer and Noël Coward. “The Great City,” a little-known jazz song by Curtis R. Lewis, epitomized his quaintly glamorous fantasy of a big bad New York, in which “you’re caught in whirlpool of East Side cafes where love is a cocktail of beards and berets.”

Ms. Fasano, who grew up on Long Island the youngest of four children, recalled making a trip to San Francisco when she was 21, and the Joni Mitchell song, “Cactus Tree,” was her credo. As she sang a slowed-down jazz arrangement of Ms. Mitchell’s portrait of a young woman who is “so busy being free” to marry any of her multiple suitors, she allowed a shade of disapproval to seep into her interpretation; that was then, this is now.

Not one of the show’s 20 songs — some of them standards, others not — received a rote performance. The final number, Philip Springer and Carolyn Leigh’s Sinatra standard, “How Little We Know (How Little It Matters),” summed up the show’s attitude of joyful mystification: “How little we understand what touches off that tingle/That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.”
1299 2010-02-12 PARIS — Credit Suisse reported a fourth-quarter profit that was below analysts’ expectations on Thursday, but said it was gaining market share in the coveted wealth management business while its rival UBS suffered.

The net profit of 793 million Swiss francs ($740 million) fell below the average forecast of 1.28 billion francs estimated by 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Still, it was an improvement on the net loss of 6.02 billion francs in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The bank said its performance was affected by a general weakening in the investment bank business and fixed-income trading, felt by many in the sector, as well as by a fine of $536 million that Credit Suisse paid to authorities in the United States over a breach of sanctions against Iran and other countries.

For the year, the bank reported net profit of 6.7 billion francs, in contrast to a loss of 8.2 billion francs in 2008, most of which came in the final quarter, after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers sent markets downward.

By contrast, in 2009, “our business was resilient in the fourth quarter despite lower client trading activity in November and December,” the bank’s chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, said in the earnings statement.
1300 2010-02-12 ¶The securities were explained in complex prospectuses that almost nobody even obtained, let alone read.

¶They were guaranteed by bond insurers, like Ambac, further persuading people there was nothing to worry about.

There was, it turns out, plenty to worry about. Espen Robak, the president of Pluris Valuation Advisors, says some of the securities are trading from 5 to 28 cents on the dollar.

The continued existence of these securities provides a reminder that the auction-rate securities market, which collapsed two years ago, is not going to go away. Low-yielding securities remain on the books of unfortunate investors or the brokerage firms that were forced to buy back the securities from some, but often not all, of their customers. Some of these investments will be around for decades, offering a reminder of a time of financial folly.

To make it even more galling for the investors, the brokerage firms that sold the paper to them get additional payments from the issuer every time there is a failed auction.

Auction-rate securities were supposed to accomplish the magic of allowing borrowers to get long-term money at short-term rates. They accomplished that by holding Dutch auctions, usually every week or month, to set the yields for the next period. There were penalty rates to be imposed if auctions failed, which were supposed to assure that borrowers, if they remained creditworthy, would refinance the debt.

We now know that for months the auctions were becoming harder and harder to complete. The Wall Street firms that had underwritten the securities put in their own bids to prevent failure, while at the same time stepping up marketing of the securities. Finally, in the Valentine’s Week massacre of 2008, virtually all firms stopped supporting auctions. The market collapsed.

Since then, there has been a gradual shrinkage of the market. More than 80 percent of the $165 billion of municipal auction-rate securities have been redeemed, but just a quarter of the $85 billion in student loan paper has been redeemed. The other major market was auction-rate preferred securities, often issued by closed-end mutual funds. About half the $60 billion of those has been retired, according to Pluris figures.

Then there is the toxic part of the market. That includes the XXX debt.

Regulation XXX, as issued by insurance commissioners, required life insurers to use government mortality tables when they calculated how much they needed to keep in reserves. The insurers deemed that unreasonable because they did not insure just anyone. They excluded those who might be greater risks. So they should be able to hold lower reserves than the rules required.

Wall Street came up with a way to lay off the excess risk onto a nonrecourse company. That company would be financed by investors who bought an array of auction-rate securities that reset every month.

Unfortunately for the investors, if too many people died, and the reserves were not really excess, the original insurance company could grab the cash. That protected policyholders, but it made the investments risky.

After the auction-rate market froze, holders of securities began to try to find out what they owned, and what it was worth. That turned out to be difficult.

Most of the holders, Mr. Robak said, “could not produce prospectuses.” It had never occurred to them to get such documentation on what they thought was a cash equivalent investment. So they called the brokers who had sold the securities, and found they did not have them either. Finding them took time.

The prospectuses now provide an incredible and perplexing reading experience.

Take one of the larger issuances, for something called Ballantyne Re, an entity set up in Ireland by Scottish Re to spare it the need to hold those “excess” reserves. A 2006 offering underwritten by Lehman Brothers raised $1.65 billion in nine different classes of securities.

One tranche of that issue, originally rated AAA by Moody’s, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, now has a CC rating from S.& P., which is about as low as you can go before default. The other agencies have withdrawn their ratings. Pluris values it at 14 cents on the dollar. It is making full payments only with help from the bond insurer Ambac, which itself is in trouble.

I have read a lot of prospectuses over the years, but I cannot recall any as baffling as this 240-page document. The purchasers of the securities may be just as well off for not having read it, although perhaps the sheer complexity would have led them to wonder whether they really wanted to invest money on terms that would yield no more than two percentage points over one-month Libor, a total now under 2.3 percent.

The prospectus includes complicated diagrams of how the cash would flow and page after page of sometimes opaque risk factors. But my favorite part is an analysis by Milliman, an actuarial firm. It was provided by Ballantyne to help investors weigh the likelihood that the insurance policies would perform as expected — that is, whether the “excess” reserves really were excess.

“In order to fully understand this report,” Milliman cautioned, “any user of the report should be advised by an actuary with a substantial level of expertise in areas relevant to this analysis to appreciate the significance of the underlying assumptions and the impact of those assumptions on the illustrated results.”

In other words, the expert tells you that you cannot hope to understand his work unless you hire your own expert. Would you need to hire another expert to understand that expert’s work?

Imagine some future doctoral student in financial history coming across this prospectus and trying to understand why anyone would have bought the securities.

He or she is likely to be puzzled. The potential upside was minimal; the potential downside was immense.

If the Ambac guaranty somehow turned out to be less than solid, there were a lot of things to be considered. Factors that would determine whether the securities would pay off, the prospectus helpfully said, “include, but are not limited to” whether assumptions were correct about mortality, future interest rates, investment performance and policyholder decisions to cancel or replace policies.

Why did the securities sell? Not because of anything in the prospectus. The securities promised a little better yield than other AAA-rated paper. That mattered to some money managers and corporate treasurers. Anyway, they were told by brokers, they could always sell at the next auction, for full face value. Why waste a lot of time evaluating a one-month investment?

Only after disaster struck did people start to find out what they had bought. The lucky ones had municipal paper that would be redeemed within a year of two. The unlucky ones had XXX securities.

It was an era of trust. Because that trust is not likely to return quickly, those who want to revive the securitization market have an uphill road ahead of them.

1306 2010-02-13 The president dissolved the government and disbanded the election commission on Friday, throwing into doubt the process of political reconciliation in a divided country that had been about to hold elections. “The government is dissolved,” President Laurent Gbagbo said in a recorded message broadcast on national television, adding that Prime Minister Guillaume Soro would be asked to stay on to form a new government. The move comes two months after the government last failed to hold presidential elections. Mr. Gbagbo’s term expired five years ago. A date for the election to either replace or re-elect him has been set — and then canceled — every year since then.
1307 2010-02-13 A federal judge on Friday dismissed options-backdating charges against the son of the former chief executive of Engineered Support Systems, a military contractor. Judge Jean Hamilton of United States District Court in St. Louis found insufficient evidence to support a complaint brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the defendant, Michael Shanahan Jr. James Martin, Mr. Shanahan’s lawyer, said the judge’s ruling was significant because she found that the S.E.C. had failed to prove that Engineered Support Systems’ stock option plan prohibited backdating. “It’s the same basic language used in every stock option agreement in the country,” he said. John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said the agency would determine how to proceed once the court issued a written decision.
1308 2010-02-13 EBay was ordered to pay about $316,500 to Louis Vuitton Malletier for legal costs and damages and stop using Internet search terms the luxury goods maker protested, after a ruling Thursday by the Paris District Court. The online auction site was found liable for harming the reputation of Louis Vuitton trademarks, the company name and domain name, all held by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. An eBay spokeswoman, Alina Piacentino, said the company would appeal the ruling.

Ebay had been buying keywords like “Viton,” “Vitton” and “Wuiton” so that online shoppers typing these misspellings into a search engine, along with anyone using the brand’s correct spelling, would be directed to links promoting eBay, a Louis Vuitton spokeswoman said. EBay said the ruling “flies in the face” of a legal victory against Ralph Lauren in an appeal of a similar case in Belgium.

“Here you have a young athlete that lost his life in pursuing his passion,” he said. “He had a dream to participate in the Olympic Games. He trained hard and he had this fatal accident. I have no words to say what we feel.”

The delegation from Georgia marched into the stadium wearing black bands around their right biceps to honor their fallen teammate. A black ribbon flowed from the top of their flag. Some of the athletes and coaches appeared to fight tears.

As the group marched into the indoor stadium, the entire crowd rose to greet it.

At first, there was speculation that the Georgians were considering pulling out of the Games. But the nation participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics despite being at war with Russia, and it has remained in these Games so far, too. Their experience, though, is forever changed.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reminded the American delegation of that before its athletes and coaches entered the stadium.

“This is a nation that has gone through an awful lot in the last three, four years,” he said of Georgia. “It’s a small nation of five million people, and the pride they had in representing their country here at the Olympics, and now to suffer this loss is just tragic.”

John Furlong, the Vancouver Games’ chief executive, advised athletes here to remember Kumaritashvili. “May you carry his Olympic dream on your shoulders and compete with his spirit in your hearts,” he said.

Organizers had been dealing with other unforeseen problems as the Games grew near.

In the past few days, training runs at the Whistler Alpine skiing venue were abbreviated or canceled because heavy rains or thick fog caused poor conditions.

At the Cypress Mountain snowboarding and freestyle skiing venue, rain and warm weather wreaked havoc. An uncommonly warm season prompted crews to bring in snow. So far, more than 100,000 cubic feet of it have been brought by truck and helicopter.

The United States Olympic team had its own problems to deal with, including the injury of the athlete who was expected to be the team’s star: the Alpine skier Lindsay Vonn.

Vonn, once expected to try for five Olympic gold medals, badly injured her right shin last week. On Friday, she remained in Whistler to rest her leg, while some of her teammates attended the opening ceremony.

More than 2,600 athletes from 82 countries participated in the event. Wearing blue jackets and white pants from Ralph Lauren, American athletes marched into the stadium behind the five-time Olympic luge athlete Mark Grimmette, who carried the American flag.

After being chosen by his peers to be the flag bearer, Grimmette explained why, at 39, he remained in his sport.

“It’s fun going down a hill 90 miles an hour, pulling 4 or 5 Gs,” he said.

Still, as the Olympic flame was set aglow for the first of 16 nights, even the most fearless athletes set to compete here were shaken. The death of one of their own cast a pall over the start of these Games.
1310 2010-02-13 The new regulations, which go into effect in June, are much more specific. They say that animals must graze on pasture for the full length of the local grazing season. The season will be determined by local conditions and agriculture authorities, like organic certifiers or county conservation officials, not by the dairy alone. While the grazing season must last at least 120 days, in many areas it will be much longer.

The rules also say that animals must get at least 30 percent of their food from pasture during the grazing season.

Mr. McEvoy said the rules would be enforced by organic certifiers who will be required to make at least one inspection a year. In some cases, additional spot checks will be made.

“There’s this feeling that it will level the playing field between the larger farms in the West and the smaller farms throughout the nation,” said Nancy Hirshberg, a vice president for Stonyfield Farm, who supported the rule change. Stonyfield markets milk from about 1,400 organic dairy farms across the country, which in most cases have about 50 to 75 cows each. She said that all the farmers who supplied Stonyfield already operated in accordance with the new rules.

Aurora Organic Dairy, based in Colorado, has been the focus of much criticism in recent years for how it pastures its animals. For many it has come to represent the contradictions embodied in large-scale organic farming. The dairy has about 15,000 cows on five farms in Colorado and Texas, with a total of about 4,400 acres of pasture, said Sally Keefe, Aurora’s vice president for government affairs.

Agriculture department data shows that in 2008 there were 2,031 organic dairies in the country, with an average of 108 cows on each one, although many had far fewer.

While Ms. Keefe said she was still reviewing the final rule on Friday, she said she expected little would have to change in the dairy’s operations.

“We already graze for at least 120 days a year, most years it’s well north of that,” Ms. Keefe said. “And we believe that we already comply with the dry matter intake requirements,” she said, referring to the rule that cows get at least 30 percent of their food from pasture during the grazing season.

Aurora, which supplies organic milk for the private label brands of several supermarket chains, agreed to make significant changes in 2007 after the agriculture department threatened to revoke its organic certification. Among the changes, the dairy agreed to give its animals greater access to pasture.

The new rules also apply to cattle raised for beef. In the case of beef cattle, however, the requirement that 30 percent of food must come from pasture is lifted during the so-called finishing period, which is when the animals are being fattened for slaughter and are often fed on grain. During that period they must still be allowed to graze, however.
1311 2010-02-13 LOS ANGELES — Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s attempt to appoint a fellow Republican as lieutenant governor, a post left vacant when the Democratic incumbent was elected to Congress, has sent Sacramento into political meltdown.

On Friday, the governor withdrew the name of his nominee, State Senator Abel Maldonado, after a fight with Democrats, who control both houses of the State Legislature, ended in a disputed vote and threats of legal action.

But Mr. Schwarzenegger said he was not giving up. He said that he would renominate Mr. Maldonado, a moderate Republican from Santa Barbara, on Tuesday.

“In an effort to avoid wasting time and energy on litigation,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a statement, he will seek a new vote in the State Assembly.

Mr. Maldonado was rejected by a vote of 37 to 35 in the Assembly on Thursday, after winning approval in the Senate. But Mr. Schwarzenegger had threatened to seat him anyway because a majority of the 80-member chamber had not voted against him. Democrats, who accounted for all 37 no votes, said the appointment had been rejected, case closed.
1312 2010-02-13 “If you’re talking about the Middle East writ large,” said the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, “Iran has an influence in each compartment. Part of it is the nuclear issue, part of it is Iran’s support for extremist groups, part of it is about how Iran is going to relate to the rest of the neighborhood.”

The American officials, Mr. Crowley noted, will also discuss other issues, like the Arab-Israeli peace process, building Palestinian institutions on the West Bank, and the administration’s long-term effort to reach out to Syria. But in these issues too, Iran casts a long shadow.

Both of Mrs. Clinton’s lieutenants, James B. Steinberg and Jacob J. Lew, are headed to the region. Mr. Lew will leave this weekend for Egypt, Israel and Jordan, while Mr. Steinberg travels to Israel the week of Feb. 21 to take part in discussions with Israel that are likely to be dominated by Iran.

The State Department’s under secretary for political affairs, William Burns, has perhaps the most challenging itinerary, traveling to Syria, one of Iran’s staunchest allies in the region, and to Lebanon, which holds a seat on the Security Council and is likely to resist sanctions against Iran.

Mr. Burns, administration officials said, will also discuss plans to return an American ambassador to Syria after a hiatus of five years. The Bush administration withdrew its envoy in 2005 to protest the assassination of the former prime minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri. Washington has long suspected Syria of being involved in the attack, a charge it denies.

By reaching out to Syria, analysts said, the United States may loosen the links between Damascus and Tehran, though administration officials caution that progress in this area is likely to be slow.

“I don’t think you’re going to see a sudden flip of the switch, where they go from Iran’s orbit to our orbit,” said a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. “But the Syrians do need to see we envision a Middle East in which they’re playing a constructive role.”

In his visit to Israel, Mr. Steinberg will take part in a strategic dialogue intended to touch on counterterrorism and regional security issues. Iran, which Israel regards as an existential threat, is likely to be at the top of the agenda, American officials said.

Iran’s announcement that it had begun enriching uranium to 20 percent purity brought expressions of alarm from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who said this week that the United Nations must impose “crippling sanctions, and these sanctions must be applied right now.”

Administration officials said they were pleased that, as one official put it, “the Iranians will see so many American officials floating around the region at the same time. They’ll definitely take notice.”

Still, some analysts said, the cavalcade of diplomats will not ultimately make a difference if the United States fails to develop a credible plan for confronting Iran or muster international support for it.

“The attitude in the Middle East countries is going to be, ‘Can we count on the United States?’ ” said Patrick Clawson, the deputy director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “If the Obama administration wants to persuade people it can deter Iran, it’s going to require continuing high-level attention. It’s going to require cold war-level diplomacy.”
1313 2010-02-13 “This was one of the hardest days I’ve had on the boat with the pressure and direction changes,” Spithill said. “But all in all it was a good day. I’m sure there are some improvements we can make, but obviously it was great.”

Racing had been scheduled to begin Monday with a second leg on Wednesday, but unfavorable winds and rough seas forced those races to be postponed.

In Friday’s race, the aggressive attack by BMW Oracle was unexpected. Alinghi was supposed to be faster in the lighter wind conditions, but BMW Oracle’s speed was apparent from the start as the two giant boats came crashing toward each other at the start.

“We tried to get across them but couldn’t,” the Alinghi skipper, Brad Butterworth, said. “When we realized that was the case, we came up and tacked over and got a penalty. That was a bit surprising, but it didn’t have an impact on the race in the end.”

The boats, the fastest and most technologically advanced in the 159-year history of the Cup, reached speeds of approximately 22 knots, or more than 25 miles an hour, in just 6 or 7 knots of wind.

The BMW Oracle president, Larry Ellison, had to watch the start from a chase boat; the American team used a minimal crew because of the light wind at the start.

“I’m confident in our team,” Ellison said after the race. “But Alinghi has got a great team and it’s all on — on Sunday — and knowing that team they’re going to be working extra hard.”

Spithill’s early move forced a penalty as Alinghi blocked BMW Oracle’s path, but Spithill then somehow stalled the trimaran, enabling Bertarelli to steer Alinghi around the marker and into the lead.

But BMW Oracle gained ground quickly and drew even about a third of the way into the 20-nautical-mile leg. It sailed faster into the wind and, by the time Spithill guided his boat across the line after the downwind leg, Alinghi had fallen two miles behind.

“It really took off,” Spithill, an Australian who sailed for the Italian team Luna Rossa at the last America’s Cup, said of his boat. “To get around the race track today without one problem to the boat is a real credit.”
1314 2010-02-13 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — And on the 32nd day, Haiti rested.

One long, arduous month after the earthquake, the Haitian government imposed a national day of mourning on this battered country, which has been too preoccupied with survival to stop and take stock of the tremendous loss of life.

In a televised memorial service broadcast over loudspeakers in many locations, President René Préval, who has been widely criticized as failing to comfort his stricken people, told a somber audience at the University of Notre Dame of Haiti that his wife had urged him to address the nation immediately after the devastating quake.

“But I said to her, ‘What can I say to the people who are dead, the people who are injured, the people who have lost loved ones?’ ” Mr. Préval said. “Haitians, the pain is too heavy for words to express.”

Wearing a black armband, Mr. Préval urged his countrymen to pray for the more than 200,000 Haitians who, by government estimates, were killed.

In the next breath, he urged them to pray, too, for former President Bill Clinton, the United Nations’ special envoy for Haiti, who underwent a procedure to clear a blocked coronary artery on Thursday.

At 4:53 p.m., the precise time that the 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck on Jan. 12, a moment of silence descended on this chaotic city, where commerce had been stilled for the day and the all-consuming recovery effort had paused. At churches, in tent cities and on the barricaded streets where many now sleep, Haitians, some dressed all in white, bowed their heads and, in places, fell to their knees.
1315 2010-02-13 The Swiss ministry of Justice announced on Friday that the authorities would not extradite the film director Roman Polanski, below, to face criminal charges in California until courts determine whether he must face sentencing in person on a charge of having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. That decision rises from the latest legal wrangling in Los Angeles, where a State Superior Court judge insisted in a January hearing that Mr. Polanski must return to the United States before his case can be concluded. A California appeals court had suggested a few weeks earlier that Mr. Polanski could be sentenced in absentia. Rudolf Wyss, a spokesman for the Swiss ministry, said the authorities were waiting for a clear “decision on the question of an in absentia trial.” Bart P. Dalton, one of Mr. Polanski’s American lawyers, said only that any new appeal would have to be filed by March 24. In a statement, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said it was reviewing news reports from Switzerland, and added: “At present, this rests with the Swiss courts. We will comment after a ruling by the courts there, not before.” Mr. Polanski, 76, remains under house arrest in his Swiss chalet. On Friday Mr. Polanski’s new political thriller movie, “The Ghost Writer” is to be shown at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.
1316 2010-02-13 “The Secret of Kells,” above, the film that grabbed a surprise Academy Award nomination for best animated feature this month, won’t be a secret to American audiences much longer. On Thursday the distributor Gkids said it would show the movie at the IFC Center in New York on March 5, two days before it vies with “Coraline,” “The Princess and the Frog,” “Up” and “Fantastic Mr. Fox” for Oscar honors. Directed by Tomm Moore, “The Secret of Kells” tells the story of a boy living in a Celtic abbey whose adventures with fairies, she-wolves and barbarians lead to the creation of the Book of Kells, the 1,200-year-old illuminated manuscript. The film was already planned to be shown in Boston on March 19, but after its Oscar nomination gave it a little extra shine, it will now receive a wider national release, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, starting on April 2.
1317 2010-02-13 Ms. Black offered as one example making dinner plans with friends and someone suggesting an expensive restaurant. It now feels O.K. to say, “It’s not in my budget right now,” when you might not have before, she said.

And the stigma of being laid off has certainly diminished, if not disappeared altogether. “One silver lining to this terribly scary time is that people can talk about their troubles without fearing that others are secretly judging them as failures,” Ms. Black said.

Dalton Conley, dean for the social sciences at New York University, agreed. “There’s a very strong norm against saying what’s on your 1040, but people will say, ‘I’ve had to give up cable,’ ” Professor Conley said.

I find that to be true. Friends are much more willing to let down their guard and admit that they are really worried about paying for their children’s college educations or summer camps, that restaurant dinners have been replaced by the occasional pizza delivery.

Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, attributed the new openness to two causes. “In a time of trauma — and we’ve been through a national trauma — people have a need to tell stories, to create a narrative.”

In addition, he said, “we have a compulsion to confess our miscalculations and misdeeds. Many of us have overspent and we now have sanction to talk about it to other people.”

But I’ve also found that commiserating about being in a financial squeeze can have its downside. That is, your broke may not be my broke. I have been surprised and even felt a tad betrayed when friends have complained about money troubles, and then I discover they’re planning an expensive remodeling or a lavish vacation. I don’t know how they’re financing it, but I do know we can’t afford it.

Shira Boss, author of “Green With Envy: Why Keeping Up with the Joneses is Keeping Us in Debt” (Warner Business Books, 2006), said there were ways of getting information — or your point across — without grilling your friends. For example, she said, how about wondering out loud how those neighbors paid for that weekend trip to Paris, saying something like, “ ‘Wow, how long did you have to save up for that?’ See what you find out, even if it’s just the look on their faces that tells you they haven’t saved.”

Some of my feelings stem from old-fashioned envy — who wouldn’t want to jet off to Paris? Still, it’s hard to have a sense of financial camaraderie. During the Depression, hard as it was, people seemed to feel as if they were pretty much all in the same boat. So why does it seem, in this recession, that some of us are in a rowboat and others in a yacht?

First of all, the Depression hit far more people — unemployment, which rose to 25 percent, was more than twice what it is now. And food stamps, unemployment benefits and other safety nets that people can turn to now were almost nonexistent, said Gianluca Violante, associate professor of economics at New York University. So large income losses were more pervasive.

The Depression was viewed more as something akin to a natural disaster, with no clear-cut villains, Professor Violante said. “Now there’s a very strong sense that a few bad guys caused this mess — bankers and financiers — and got out of it without too much pain, and some good guys — the general public — are paying the price.”

In addition, while income inequality was high before the Depression, during the 1930s and 1940s it compressed radically, Professor Conley said. The extremes of wealth and poverty didn’t begin again until the 1970s and only reached pre-Depression heights in 2007.

It may be hard to comprehend what that really means in our lives, but a friend of mine whose husband has been unemployed for a year sees the inequality every day.

“In our community, people talk recession, but when I look around, I don’t see it affecting them,” she said.

So will talking more frankly about money matters actually make us feel better or worse? Do I need to know that the couple down the road makes 10 times more than what we do?

Well, perhaps we don’t need to publicize our bank balance. But being more open about financial realities may be a good thing. The problem is that the shame in talking about it, Ms. Boss said, leads people to hide their problems — and think they’re the only ones suffering money problems — rather than seek help.

Knowledge is also useful. We all might have a more enlightened discussion about public policy, Professor Conley said, if we realistically knew the cost of inequality and where we ranked on the economic ladder. He pointed to studies that show that 19 percent of Americans think they are in the wealthiest top 2 percent.

And as more and more of us go out on our own, as freelancers or consultants, information about how and what to charge can be helpful. I belong to an organization of journalists and authors, for example. For many years, it has provided a section where members anonymously contribute information about how much they are paid for the work they do, providing a financial framework for the others.

Will this new frankness, such as it is, lead to greater financial transparency? Most people I talked to think that’s unlikely in the long term. But maybe we can seize this moment to learn some home truths. Trying to keep up with the Joneses, for instance, is a no-win game, and it turns out that many of those we envied for their supposed wealth built it on a shaky foundation of debt.

Maybe wanting less, rather than making more, is the only way we’ll ever feel as if we have enough.
1318 2010-02-13 WASHINGTON (Reuters) — A Federal Reserve governor Daniel K. Tarullo said on Friday that he favored allowing a council of existing regulators to collect and analyze data on systemic risks in the financial system, rather than creating a new agency to do so.

The council approach could provide the benefits of an independent agency, namely greater speed and a broader approach, while avoiding the drawbacks of an independent agency, Mr. Tarullo said in testimony before a Senate Banking Committee panel.

Because a new, independent agency would not have a direct role in supervision or market monitoring it would be handicapped in understanding the types of information needed to monitor systemic risks and supervise key financial institutions, he said.

“The council would be directed to seek to resolve conflicts among the agencies in a way that would preserve nimbleness, and it could recommend that an agency develop new types of data, but it would leave the details of data collection and analysis to the agencies that are closest to the relevant firms and markets,” Mr. Tarullo said in remarks to the Banking Committee’s Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance.

He said systemic risk data collection and analysis is better housed in the agencies that already regulate financial institutions.

His comments aligned him squarely with a House financial reform bill, which calls for an inter-agency council to police systemic risk among large financial institutions, relying heavily on the Fed as an agent for executing policy.
1319 2010-02-13 AFTER years of being told by Asians and Europeans that it had to find a way to reduce its trade deficit, the United States did find a way in 2009. A global recession did the trick, producing the largest decline ever in the deficit.

The recession caused American imports to fall by 26 percent, by far the largest annual drop in imports of goods since the government began keeping trade statistics in 1948. There have been only a few years with any declines at all, with the largest before 2009 being a fall of nearly 7 percent in 1982, another recession year.

Exports also fell, but not by as much, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. The result was a trade deficit in goods of $501 billion, or 3.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. That was down from $816 billion, or 5.7 percent of gross domestic product.

Any way you slice that, it was the largest improvement in the trade deficit on record. In terms of G.D.P., the biggest improvement before 2009 was in 1988, when the deficit declined by almost 1 percent. In terms of dollars, the improvement of $315 billion was almost 10 times as big as the largest previous improvement, of nearly $35 billion, in 1988. Then, the dollar was plunging, improving the country’s trade competitiveness.

Even so, the deficit, as a percentage of G.D.P., is larger than it ever was before 1999.

Whether the trade deficit continues to decline, even if less sharply, may depend on the pace of economic recovery, both in the United States and in the rest of the world. Slower American growth would restrain imports. Faster growth in other countries would be likely to increase exports.
1320 2010-02-13 PARIS — The Swiss ministry of Justice announced Friday that authorities will not extradite the film director Roman Polanski to face criminal charges in California until Los Angeles courts determine whether he must face sentencing in person on charges of having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977.

That decision rises from the latest legal wrangling in Los Angeles where a State Superior Court judge insisted in a January hearing that Mr. Polanski must return to the United States before his case can be concluded. A California appeals court had suggested a few weeks earlier that Mr. Polanski could be sentenced in absentia.

Rudolf Wyss, a spokesman for the Swiss ministry, said that authorities there are waiting for a clear “decision on the question of an in absentia trial.” He added that Mr. Polanski’s lawyers have until March 24 to appeal the state judge’s ruling.

Meanwhile, Mr. Polanski, 76, remains under house arrest in his Swiss chalet while his work is being feted in the major capitals of Europe. On Friday, Polanski’s new political thriller movie, “The Ghost Writer” is to be shown at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and is expected to dominate the event.

While in prison and under house arrest in Gstaad, Mr. Polanski was still working on the movie, which stars Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan. To coincide with the release of the film, the Kinoteka Polish Film Festival is also organizing a retrospective in London for Mr. Polanski, who holds dual citizenship in Poland and France.

An exhibition of rare Polanski film posters will be on display along with screenings of his film, “Rosemary’s Baby,” and the 2008 documentary of the film director’s travails, “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.”

1327 2010-02-14 “Things are still tight here,” she said. “The loan really helped the bank, but what about me?”

Ms. Wright is one of many Chicagoans who own struggling small businesses, the kind of companies that create most new jobs around the country. She is among the entrepreneurs that economists and President Obama hope will resume hiring and rescue the economy from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

In fact, Ms. Wright is one of the lucky ones. Thanks to a federal guarantee that her lender will be repaid, she borrowed the $35,000 and appreciated the help. Thousands of other small-business owners say banks will not lend them money at any price — particularly in troubled industries like home building, where credit is crucial and jobs are particularly important to the South Side and other black neighborhoods.

“Getting a loan in this area has been hard for quite a while, and getting a construction loan is nearly impossible,” said William Wolk, president of Team 4, a contractor and real estate development consultant who often works on the South Side.

But Ms. Wright’s mixed fortune at ShoreBank also suggests why the government’s current efforts to prime the pump are sputtering despite record low interest rates and federal spending financed by huge budget deficits.

While multibillion-dollar loan programs may sound like a boon to the economy, Ms. Wright’s experience shows they have been structured so they help the people who do the hiring as much as the ones who make the loans.

Ms. Wright has been in business for 14 years, employing a small staff and supplying uniforms to schools, businesses and institutions. For most of those years, business was good.

Things started to change in 2008 as it became clear that the nation’s banks had gone on a credit binge that seeded many bank portfolios with toxic loans. As bankers and economists tried to figure out the severity of the problem, many banks slashed credit.

Business conditions deteriorated as credit tightened, unemployment soared and many consumers were unable to keep up with their mortgages. A wave of foreclosures on the South Side showed that blacks in particular were struggling, and small businesses based in mostly black areas have tended to suffer along with them.

Mr. Wolk said subprime loans, those with more onerous terms, and Alt A mortgages, ones with more flexible borrowing conditions, accounted for nearly half the home loans in some South Side neighborhoods. As troubles with those mortgages mounted, layoffs in the construction and manufacturing industries hit black neighborhoods particularly hard.

An economic-hardship report by the Metro Chicago Information Center shows that unemployment rates in predominately black South Side neighborhoods like Englewood, Chatham, Auburn, Gresham and South Shore are now two to three times higher than the average in other areas of the city. Some government reports estimate that the unemployment rate now stands at 20 percent to 25 percent in parts of the South Side.

Like many other businesses surrounded by neighborhoods of foreclosed homes, unemployed workers and shuttered storefronts, The Wright Fit felt the economic pain. Ms. Wright said she cut back to only part-time employees about a year ago and started trimming expenses.

“My big customers started bundling,” she said, a practice in which companies consolidate their purchase orders and tap one uniform company in hopes of winning a better price with a large order.

“I started partnering with others to keep part of that business,” she said. But her customers started taking longer to pay her. Last summer she read about the loan program on the Small Business Administration’s Web site.

Ms. Wright contacted ShoreBank, which has a national reputation for operating profitably in low-income neighborhoods, and bank officials helped her apply with the S.B.A., which was one of the few programs the bank could turn to for aid.

At the time, federal and state bank regulators, worried about the struggles confronting ShoreBank’s customers, told the bank to improve its financial footing by trimming its loan portfolio and bolstering its capital. Both steps require ShoreBank to curtail lending. Under the American Recovery Capital Loan Program, the S.B.A. guaranteed that the bank’s loan to Ms. Wright would be repaid.

Ms. Wright said she was disappointed that her $35,000 loan could not be used to help boost her working capital and ease the pressure from her store’s day-to-day needs. But using it to repay her ShoreBank loan did help her reduce costs.

“Look,” she said, “it’s $1,000 a month that I no longer have to worry about.”

Brian Berg, ShoreBank’s vice president for marketing, said the American Recovery Capital program required that the proceeds of Ms. Wright’s loan be used to pay the principal or interest on existing bank loans.

The recovery capital program is only one of numerous S.B.A. loan programs, but the agency promoted it as one that would help small businesses weather the downturn and ease cash problems.

David Schroeder, vice president of federal relations at the Community Bankers Association of Illinois did not know the specifics of Ms. Wright’s case, but said it illustrated a broader problem that Congress needed to consider as its took up the far larger $30 billion small-business program that Mr. Obama proposed in his recent State of the Union message to help create jobs.

“You have the Congress and the administration saying, Lend, lend, lend, and you have the regulators saying, Tighten your underwriting and strengthen your capital,” Mr. Schroeder said.

The latter two steps tend to discourage lending.

As for Ms. Wright, in early February she moved her store across the street to a space that is half the size of her former location.

“I cut my rent and utilities in half,” she said as she searched her new space for room to store her inventory. Her work force is down to her, her sister and a couple of part-time employees, but she said the economic situation was still tough.

“People are just scared to spend money,” she said. “Many come in here, and it’s like a bargain basement. They want a low price.”

She said her customers were worried that they would lose their jobs.

You must get creative, Ms. Wright said, and she is building her Web site to see whether she can use it to market her uniforms more effectively.

She will survive, she said, adding, “I don’t have any other choice.”
1328 2010-02-14 Mr. Yanukovich, the opposition leader, mounted a comeback in this election after being the loser in the Orange Revolution. He has ties to the Kremlin, and has already indicated that he hopes to improve Ukraine’s relations with Russia.

He has said that Ms. Tymoshenko should concede and resign as prime minister for the good of the nation.

Ms. Tymoshenko had stirred speculation that she might do so by remaining largely out of the public eye in recent days. But she is known for her political intensity, and the tone of her remarks on Saturday night suggested that she would not immediately respond to domestic or international pressure to back down.

Preliminary results showed that Mr. Yanukovich won by roughly 900,000 votes. But Ms. Tymoshenko said that more than a million votes had been falsified in his favor. She said that on the Crimean Peninsula, a Yanukovich stronghold, 3 to 8 percent of the votes had been stolen for him.

She said some election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe would support her in court, though she did not mention which ones. The organization approved of the election.

While not seeking demonstrations, Ms. Tymoshenko appeared to be trying to reignite the Orange movement, which arose after Mr. Yanukovich won the 2004 presidential election and his campaign was accused of fraud. Protests forced a new election, which Mr. Yanukovich lost to Viktor A. Yushchenko.

“Our opponents, as they did in 2004, demonstrated that they are not prepared to be elected by honest, democratic rules,” Ms. Tymoshenko said Saturday night. “They have perfectly well realized that they have no chance of earning the sympathy of the majority of people in a lawful way.”

There are major differences between the current situation and the earlier one. European election monitors assailed the 2004 election won by Mr. Yanukovich as deeply flawed, and many countries would not recognize it. What is more, Ukrainians were more enthusiastic about politics back then.

Now, Ukraine’s economy is hurting from the financial crisis, and the public is disillusioned with infighting in the government.
1329 2010-02-14 The “tip of the iceberg” quote attributed to me was in reference to my belief that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York missed an early warning signal of the impending global credit crisis. Something was clearly amiss when the gap in valuation was so wide between two prominent players of the caliber of A.I.G. Financial Products and Goldman Sachs.

Beyond figuring out who was right and wrong in the valuations, the Fed would have learned much more by digging into the motivations of each side. The Fed would have learned something that should have been blindingly obvious: management at A.I.G.F.P. was reluctant to accede to Goldman’s valuation for fear of having to crystallize career-threatening losses in reports to the company’s ultimate parent on Pine Street. By contrast, Goldman was worried about protecting its profits.

History has long shown us that hiding disasters is the stronger of the two motivations, and it is a motivation that often leads to dire results. By understanding this, the Fed would have realized that these large disparities were indeed highlighting the vast extent of the problem.

This conclusion would have been further reinforced if the Fed had understood the difference in the risk management culture of the two institutions. A.I.G.F.P. was warehousing default risk, essentially adopting a trade and hold strategy. Goldman, by contrast, tends to be more systematically focused on managing its risk, and because it is more active in modeling, trading and hedging its portfolios, its valuation measures would be more strongly grounded in market pricing.

At the time, the crisis was simply being called a “subprime crisis.” If the Fed had done its job better, if would have realized earlier that the entire financial system was in deep distress.

1330 2010-02-14 David J. Morrow, a prominent financial journalist and a former editor in chief of TheStreet.com, died on Feb. 1 in Spartanburg, S.C. He was 49 and lived in Reno, Nev.

The cause was cancer, his sister Beth Hammond said.

At his death, Mr. Morrow held the first Donald W. Reynolds endowed chair in business journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno, a position he took up last summer.

Mr. Morrow was editor in chief of TheStreet.com, one of the leading financial news Web sites, from 2001 to 2009. Under his stewardship the site won many honors, including five awards from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, a Gerald Loeb Award and two awards from the New York Press Club.

David Jerome Morrow was born in Spartanburg on Dec. 18, 1960. He earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of South Carolina in 1983. He later worked at Fortune and Smart Money magazines, The Detroit Free Press and, from 1996 to 2000, The New York Times, where he was a business reporter.

Besides Ms. Hammond, of Lawrenceville, Ga., Mr. Morrow is survived by his mother, Emily R. Morrow, and another sister, Janice E. Morrow, both of Inman, S.C.
1331 2010-02-14 Marvin Phaup, a research scholar at George Washington University who examines federal budgeting, is one who is urging such an assessment. An expert on government guarantees, his wholly sensible view is that it is dangerous for possible bailout costs to remain unmeasured and, of course, unrecognized in the budget. “If we are extending the safety net, extending the implied guarantee to the debts of a lot of other financial institutions, and we know those guarantees are valuable and costly, then we ought to start budgeting for it,” Mr. Phaup said in an interview. “We can’t reduce the costs of these subsidies if we can’t recognize them.”

Mr. Phaup has the bona fides to opine on this topic. He was the researcher at the Congressional Budget Office in 1996 who undertook the first efforts to assign a value to the implied federal guarantee backing Fannie and Freddie. When he prognosticated on the matter, the bailouts of those two hobbled entities were more than a decade away, but his C.B.O. report quantified the billions in benefits that the mortgage finance companies reaped each year from their implicit government backstop.

In 1995, the report said, the value of the companies’ government subsidy totaled $6.5 billion; this amount largely reflected lower borrowing costs at the companies, a result of views held by investors that Fannie’s and Freddie’s obligations had Uncle Sam’s backing.

THE C.B.O. report enraged Fannie and Freddie because it also showed how much of that financial benefit — fully one-third — the companies kept for themselves, their managers and their stockholders. Mr. Phaup’s analysis showed that, counter to the companies’ claims, Fannie and Freddie did not pass along all the benefits to homeowners in the form of lower mortgage rates.

Moreover, who actually believed in 1996 that the government would ever have to bail out Fannie and Freddie? Perish the thought and shame on silly researchers like Mr. Phaup for even considering such possibilities.

Fast-forward to today, and the government guarantees for Fannie and Freddie have become painfully explicit. While it’s unclear how much their rescues will cost taxpayers, last Christmas Eve the government removed the $400 billion cap on the amount of assistance it was willing to provide the companies in emergency aid through 2012.

Today’s implied guarantees extend well beyond Fannie and Freddie. But owning up to future obligations associated with government backing is something that lawmakers are likely to fight vigorously. (Consider Social Security.)

But ignoring such obligations doesn’t make them go away. And getting a handle on their possible cost is a worthy exercise, for several reasons.

First, Mr. Phaup said, if we assign a value to the guarantees, the government would be better able to charge for it. “Even if we don’t do that, by recognizing the cost now we will save more because we will either tax more or preferably spend less” to pay for it down the road if need be, Mr. Phaup said. “In the end, that’s really the only way to prepare for a contingency like a meltdown of the financial system.”

A second benefit is that recognizing the costs of guaranteeing too-influential-to-fail institutions might reduce the ultimate obligation and persuade regulators and lawmakers to force those institutions to cut back on risk-taking.

It’s not as if the costs associated with these guarantees can’t be accurately estimated. Valuing so-called contingent claims, chits that have not been called in, has become a much more sophisticated process in recent decades, Mr. Phaup pointed out. “We know how to do it for private firms,” he said. “Fewer people in the government know how to do it, but those skills can be transferred.”

Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College, agrees that the costs associated with providing a safety net for complex and politically connected companies should be quantified. “People talk about systemic risk, but they have no metric of measuring it,” he said. “If we recognize that obligations are being put on the taxpayer down the line, then they can be controlled and managed.”

Mr. Kane suggested that lawmakers create an independent entity to collect data from all the protected firms so a realistic price tag could be placed on possible bailout costs. “We would force the institutions to give preliminary estimates and then challenge them,” he said. The combined figure for all the institutions would represent the total responsibility being shifted onto the backs and wallets of taxpayers.

“If government officials really wanted to do something, this is the kind of thing they would do,” Mr. Kane said.

That is the rub, of course.

Lawmakers interested in re-election have little incentive to be truthful about what implied guarantees of powerful companies will cost the taxpayer. Better to brush it under the rug or pretend the costs don’t exist. Then, when they must be paid, policy makers can argue that it’s an unforeseen emergency and an odious necessity.

As the number of firms with implicit government backing has risen because of the crisis, so too have the expected costs of those commitments, Mr. Phaup said. And yet, under current budget policy, those costs will be ignored until the recipient of the guarantee collapses — the precise moment when the guarantee is likely to cost taxpayers the most.

Three years into the crisis, we are no closer to reining in too-powerful-to-fail companies or eliminating the risks they pose to taxpayers. Both goals are achievable, yet our legislators refuse to do what is necessary to protect us from trillion-dollar bailouts down the road.
1332 2010-02-14 A lender is supposed to issue a 1099-C form reporting forgiven debt, but that doesn’t always happen if the principal is not reduced, Mr. Ford said.

Ms. Zarlenga, a vice chairwoman of the same bar association committee, said there were exceptions to the forgiven-debt rule. Some of them are big enough to drive an S.U.V. through — if it hasn’t been repossessed.

Forgiven debt is not taxable income, she said, if it is discharged by bankruptcy, or if the debtor is insolvent when the debt is forgiven. Insolvent doesn’t necessarily mean bankrupt: it just means broke. The I.R.S. defines it as a financial condition in which the “liabilities exceed the fair market value of the assets.”

Bailout measures aimed at helping homeowners generally won’t prompt forgiven-debt tax on a principal home, because Congress exempted up to $2 million of such relief. But foreclosures, short sales and other loss-of-home scenarios could bring on capital gains tax, Ms. Zarlenga said.

If a house worth significantly more than a mortgage is repossessed and sold by the lender, the owner gets the difference but has a taxable profit, which will cause a capital gain. But Mr. Ford noted that the first $500,000 on gains on a main home for couples ($250,000 for single taxpayers) may be covered by a tax exclusion. And nonrecourse mortgages, in which the lender can’t touch any assets other than the property, generally don’t cause such a gain.

Aside from homeowners, people who had to withdraw money prematurely from their retirement accounts because of a job loss or reduced work hours also face extra taxes.

Holders of traditional I.R.A.’s and I.R.A. rollover accounts must pay 10 percent of any amount withdrawn before they reach 59 1/2 as a penalty, according to Michael H. Iacolucci, a financial planner in Ballston Spa, N.Y. That is on top of the regular tax on money taken out, which must be paid regardless of one’s age.

Holders of Roth I.R.A.’s face different rules. The holder’s contributions — but not the account earnings — can be withdrawn without penalty after five years, according to Mr. Iacolucci.

Participants in employer-sponsored plans, like 401(k)s and 403(b)s, face yet another set of rules. For them, withdrawals are penalty-free if the account holder left the employer that set up the plan after he or she turned 55. But money rolled over to an I.R.A. from a former employer’s plan is subject to the 59 1/2-age rule, according to Mr. Iacolucci, an expert on the tax treatment of tax-deferred accounts.

“There could be some relief for some people” from penalties on early withdrawals, he explained, referring to an arcane plan known as substantially equal periodic payments. It is still available for withdrawals made last year.

Under that plan, someone who is not yet 59 1/2 can avoid the 10 percent penalty by taking payments from an I.R.A .or a 401(k) account based on life expectancy. But Mr. Iacolucci cautioned that someone using such a plan must continue to take the minimum distributions for at least five years or until reaching 59 1/2 — whichever comes sooner. That might make using the equal-payment plan unattractive for someone who made a one-time withdrawal to meet an emergency.

Such a plan need not be declared to the I.R.S. in advance, Mr. Iacolucci said, so someone who withdrew funds last year could do the calculation this year “and possibly find a safe harbor.”

DETERMINING the minimum withdrawals under such a plan used to be the province of accountants and other tax experts, and often still is, Mr. Iacolucci said, although tax software might be able to walk some taxpayers through the calculations.

Most 401(k) and 403(b) plans generally do not allow current employees to make withdrawals. But they often have loan provisions — and another tax nightmare can occur if an employee with an outstanding loan loses his or her job. In that case, the loan must be repaid quickly. Otherwise, the balance is treated as a withdrawal. Then it is subject to tax and to the 10 percent penalty if the employee is under 55, unless an equal-payment plan is used.
1333 2010-02-14 The Buffalo Bills announced Friday that they are raising ticket prices for season-ticket holders. The average season-ticket price will rise to a little over $59, up from about $51. Barring price increases by other teams, the hike would cost the Bills the spot they held last year as the cheapest ticket in the N.F.L..
1334 2010-02-14 At 10 degrees, the Minnesota air is just cold enough for the dogs with heavier coats, like the left wheel-dog, who dips his snout in the snow more often than the dogs ahead of him. I am seated in the basket of the sled, as stiff as a quartered moose. Behind me, riding the runner, is the musher, Kelly Murphy. We slow now and then to let the teams behind us stay close, and when we do, the dogs  seven of them, right and left of the gangline hooked to their harnesses  look impatiently at us, haunches quivering, ready to pull and pull again.

We have been sledding down an old portage road, along the lip of a beaver dam, through a tunnel of young white birch with rosy bark, all within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Now we break onto the open ice, wolf tracks looping away to the low, wooded islands in the distance. I take my turn at the handle bow  riding where the musher rides, minding the brake  while Murphy jogs ahead of the dog team. They follow him in a wide curve, cutting a new track that will eventually lead us back to the place on the portage where, overnight, the wolves reduced a deer to a few scraps of hide. We are six miles out from where we started, so this is only a sprint for the team.

I listen to the one-way singsong between Murphy and his dogs, encouragement and caution and admiration. I watch the driving legs ahead of me  28 of them  on dogs whose frames are small and light, nothing like the creatures I’d imagined. And as we cut through the white ash swamp, hissing across the ice, I find myself wondering, why do sled dogs run?

It is not a matter of driving them. All the work is in pacing them, restraining them. When Murphy stands on the brake and sets the snow hook  a two-pronged anchor  the gangline quivers with tension. The dogs torque forward again before he can shout, “Let’s go!” All the one-word answers to my question are too simple: love, joy, duty, obedience.

The dogs were out yesterday, and they’ll be out again tomorrow. They don’t run for a reward or toward a goal  the greyhound’s mechanical rabbit. They get yelled at when they chew on the gangline and petted when the run is over. They don’t catch or flee anything. They would keep running if the musher fell off his sled.

The start is a mayhem of yelping and baying and yipping. The finish is 21 dogs, three teams’ worth, silently lapping the air with their tongues. And between the two  start and finish  is a reason the dogs describe in the only way they know how, by running and running and never letting the line go slack.
1335 2010-02-14 In the Bush years, the rallying cry when operations like Marja began was “clear, build and hold.” Mr. Obama has added a fourth step, “transfer.” At the end of the three-month-long review of Afghan strategy, Mr. Obama vowed he would begin no military operation unless a plan was in place to transfer authority promptly to the Afghans.

That plan exists in Marja, at least on paper. Both the Americans and the Afghan military did everything to advertise the coming military strike short of posting billboards with the date and size of the operation. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the American commander who persuaded Mr. Gates, and ultimately Mr. Obama, to try his form of counterinsurgency, insisted last week that the “transfer” element of the strategy had been prepared and would kick in as soon as the Taliban fled or were defeated.

“We’ve got a government in a box, ready to roll in,” General McChrystal said.

The gamble here is that once Afghans see the semblance of a state taking hold in Marja, rank-and-file Taliban will begin to take more seriously the offers that Mr. Karzai and the West are dangling to buy them off. Enticed by the offer of some political role in Afghan society — and a regular paycheck — they will think twice about trying to recapture the town. “We think many of the foot soldiers are in it for the money, not the ideology,” one British official said recently. “We need to test the proposition that it’s cheaper to enrich them a little than to fight them every spring and summer.”

The problem, of course, is that governments-in-a-box that are ready to roll in can also be rolled out — or rolled over. And the most heated arguments that unfolded during the Afghanistan review pitted those who thought that Mr. Karzai’s government needed one more chance to show it could get it right against those who argued that they had been to this movie before, and it always ended the same way.

No one put the warning to Mr. Obama more succinctly — or more baldly — than Karl W. Eikenberry, the American ambassador. A scholarly former general who served twice in Afghanistan, Mr. Eikenberry was among the first to raise the alarm during the Bush years that the American approach in Afghanistan was failing. Recently he warned Mr. Obama against putting the success of American strategy in Mr. Karzai’s less-than-reliable hands.

“President Karzai is not an adequate strategic partner,” he wrote in one of several cables to the State Department that, predictably, later leaked. Counterinsurgency is a great strategy, Mr. Eikenberry argued, but only if it is executed systematically and energetically. That was what was missing, he said, from the strategic reassessment that General McChrystal submitted late last summer.

“The proposed counterinsurgency strategy assumes an Afghan political leadership that is both able to take responsibility and to exert sovereignty in the furtherance of our goal,” he wrote. “Yet Karzai continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden, whether defense, governance or development. He and much of his circle do not want the U.S. to leave and are only too happy to see us invest further.” He is hardly alone in that assessment. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave voice to similar concerns. So did the leaders of India.

Mr. Eikenberry told Congress in December that his worries have since been largely allayed, and he is now perfectly satisfied with President Obama’s strategy. But he seemed to be speaking for a wing of the Obama administration that fears the Obama counterinsurgency strategy could crumble in Mr. Karzai’s hands.
1336 2010-02-14 Re “In Pursuing Sports Glory, Ignoring All the Rules,” Feb. 12: As a former student-athlete at Binghamton, I am dismayed at the negative publicity brought upon the university by its athletic department. But I am equally dismayed that the SUNY board would try to mitigate the negative effects by paying $913,000 to Skadden Arps for its report on the scandal. Was the report really worth it during a time of SUNY budget cuts, tuition increases and reduced financial aid?

Lois B. DeFleur, the university president, and Joel Thirer, when he was the athletic director, lost sight of their academic mission in their pursuit of athletic glory. The SUNY board has now done no better by funneling money to the world of corporate law. Let’s not play this game and instead return the SUNY system to its original goal: affordable, high-quality education for all.

Re “Canada’s Unlikely Medal Quest: Plenty of Gold,” Feb. 10: Anyone who really gets to know Canadians should realize that though they may indeed be modest, they are anything but stupid. They haven’t survived as a sovereign nation while living next door to us by being sweet and naïve purveyors of maple syrup.

To be certain, Olympic gold can help burnish national pride and boost the popularity of individual sports. But it also can bring torrents of worldwide attention, along with the many, many corporate dollars that are required (in ever more staggering numbers) to place any kind of medals around athletes’ necks, as well as to permit cities like Vancouver to even consider hosting an Olympic Games. Canadians can only be commended for attempting to capitalize, as have other nations, on all of the value that can be gained by owning the podium. Mary Stanik

“Carolina-Duke Reflects a Changing Landscape” (Feb. 10) conflates games played away from home and games played on an opponent’s home floor, stating that the Blue Devils’ 2-4 record on the road “does not inspire faith once the neutral courts and unfamiliar officials of the N.C.A.A. tournament arrive.”

But Duke is actually 4-0 in games played on neutral courts. Add those to the 2-4 record on opponents’ home courts, and Duke was actually 6-4 “on the road” (away from home). As nobody gets a home game in the tourney, the record in games played at neutral sites might be a useful statistic. But clearly such games, for both teams, are road games. Robert T. Tally Jr.

Re “Colts’ Approach Leaves Room for Second-Guesses,” Feb. 9: William C. Rhoden contends that Coach Jim Caldwell and the Colts played it safe, while the moves of Coach Sean Payton and the Saints were bold in the Super Bowl. But overlooked was the simple but critical fact that Dwight Freeney’s ankle injury hindered the Colts’ pass rush, allowing Drew Brees to throw at will. Hence the wild delusion that the Saints are a better team and Brees the better quarterback, and the savior of New Orleans. Sheldon Rosen

I am having difficulty deciding which was the most unlikely: that the Saints won after 40-something years, or that the best Super Bowl commercial starred two 80-somethings. Never count out people who refuse to give up! P. A. Moye
1337 2010-02-14 On Thursday, a day before Nodar Kumaritashvili of the Republic of Georgia had his fatal accident on a training run, the United States luge athlete Mark Grimmette was asked about the sliding center’s speed. “I think we’re probably getting close, too close, to the edge,” he said.

That day, a Romanian luge racer was knocked unconscious during a training run. Through five complete Olympic training sessions in men’s singles luge last week, one of every 20 runs ended in a crash.

But Olympic and luge officials chose not to make changes to the course that would limit the record speeds — in excess of 90 miles per hour, or 145 kilometers per hour — that the sliding-sport athletes were attaining.

Late Friday night, in a joint statement from the sport’s federation and the Vancouver Organizing Committee, officials concluded “there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track.”

They said that Kumaritashvili “did not compensate properly to make correct entrance into Curve 16.”

The track twists and turns along the lower slopes of Blackcomb Mountain, 80 miles north of Vancouver. From beginning to end, less than a mile traveled in less than a minute, the vertical drop is equivalent to about 48 stories.

Many of the 16 curves have nicknames like Lynx and Shiver. The United States bobsled pilot Steven Holcomb called one curve 50-50 after watching four of eight sleds crash there a little more than a year ago.

He and his team knew their initial trial run would arrive the next morning. “I hadn’t been that nervous to be in a bobsled my entire life, even my first time down in a sled,” the American brakeman Steve Mesler said.

It is a familiar emotion for athletes in the sliding sports. Whistler immediately became the fastest track in the world, eliciting speeds of nearly 96 m.p.h. (about 154 kilometers per hour) in luge, a sport in which riders lie on a sled and wear little protection but a skintight suit and a helmet.

Manuel Pfister of Austria reached 95.6 m.p.h. (154 k.p.h.), the fastest luge speed recorded during a training run on Thursday.

“We are going to have to put in speed limits for the next track,” the luge federation’s spokesman, Wolfgang Harder, told Reuters on Thursday, referring to the next Olympics. “We think 155 kilometers per hour should be the limit. We have to take care of the security of our athletes.”

At the luge track in Cesana, Italy, during the 2006 Olympics, the gold medalist Armin Zoeggeler’s four runs averaged 84.2 m.p.h. (135.5 k.p.h.).

“The run in Cesana four years ago was already at the limit for lugers,” Christoph Schweiger, the general secretary of the Austrian luge federation, told The Kurier newspaper in Austria. “Here, at Whistler, they went one step too far and past certain limits.”

Walter Plaikner, the chairman of the federation’s technical commission and coach of the Italian luge team, told reporters a year ago that 150 k.p.h. was “about as fast as we can go in our sport.” In the first Olympic training run Friday at the Whistler Sliding Centre, seven luge riders surpassed 150 k.p.h.

The bobsledder Pierre Lueders, a five-time Olympian for Canada, got a feel for the track’s punishing characteristics early. He crashed twice during course testing in 2008. At the time, he said he had not crashed in eight years.

Kumaritashvili, ranked 44th in the World Cup standings this season, neared the end of a training run traveling about 90 m.p.h. when he seemed to lose control going through Curve 16, a high-banked, U-shaped bend to the right. Exiting the turn, his sled bounced off the inside wall, and the force lifted Kumaritashvili up and over the opposite wall. He flew into a support pillar that holds a canopy and lights above the track.

His sled, however, never left the icy chute. It came to a stop, on its runners, past the finish line. Kumaritashvili’s goggles also remained on the track.

That portion of the course, near the finish, was to be modified by the time racing resumed on Saturday. But the difference between the Whistler course and others is noticeable from the beginning. The first two curves are longer than those on most European tracks, causing athletes to build speed quickly, instead of gaining momentum slowly on their journey down.

“You are traveling really fast from Curve 1,” Chris Mazdzer of the United States said. “Around Curve 2, you are going 60. There is not a transition from slow to fast. You are going fast from the top down.”

Speeds peak as athletes enter the most technically difficult stretch of the course. Curves 12 to 15, known as the Golden Rush Trail, are four turns without a straightaway.

The curves come quickly, and a single mistake can cause a chain reaction — and a violent crash. Before Friday, Curve 13, the one known as 50-50, received the most attention.

“It’s about where you start hitting 90, 95 miles per hour,” Holcomb, the bobsled pilot, said, “and it’s right where the turns start to get tight and really close together, and all of a sudden there’s no time for reaction. If you’re a second off or a hundredth of a second off, you’re going to be in trouble and it’s going to cause a lot of problems.”
1338 2010-02-14 Melissa Nicole Stai, the daughter of Peggy Stai and Russ Stai of San Diego, is to be married there Sunday to Matt Eric Weiss, a son of Rachel Weiss and Dr. Alan Weiss of Cheshire, Conn. The Rev. Mark Trotter, a United Methodist minister, is to perform a nondenominational ceremony at the Admiral Kidd Club, an event space.

The bride, 29, will be taking her husband’s name. She works in Baltimore for LifeBridge Health, a regional system of hospitals and other health care centers. She is an internal consultant who manages cost reduction and operational efficiency. She graduated from Stanford and received an M.B.A. from Santa Clara University.

The bride’s father, who retired from the Navy as captain, last served at North Island Naval Base in Coronado, Calif., and is now a commercial real estate broker in San Diego for Cushman & Wakefield. Her mother is a registered nurse in a San Diego office of the Children’s Primary Care Medical Group, a multi-office pediatric group.

The bridegroom, 26, works for the Baltimore Ravens as the head coaching assistant. He graduated from Vanderbilt and received a master’s degree in liberal arts from Stanford.

The bridegroom’s mother is an assistant principal at Jeffrey Elementary School in Madison, Conn. His father, a retired periodontist who practiced in Hamden, Conn., is a visiting lecturer at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn.

The couple met on Valentine’s Day in 2007, were engaged on Valentine’s Day in 2009, and so made plans to marry on that day this year.
1339 2010-02-14 Mark Pittman, an investigative reporter for Bloomberg News, had filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Federal Reserve Board, seeking the details of its unprecedented efforts to funnel money to the collapsing banks of Wall Street. Mr. Pittman, sometimes known as Bloomberg’s Yoda for his Jedi-like command of economic issues, had quietly surmised that the Fed was holding tightly to the secrets of the bailout. So he was hardly surprised when, after four months, it had failed to even answer his request. He was nonetheless annoyed. One day, even grumpier than usual, he approached his boss, Amanda Bennett, as she stood talking in the company’s East Side newsroom with an in-house lawyer named Charles Glasser.

“Pittman was this big shlumpy guy and he was wandering around going, ‘Argh argh argh,’ ” Ms. Bennett said recently. “So we asked him, ‘What’s with your FOIA?’ And Mark says — he used some colorful language — ‘They won’t answer us.’ ”

“That was when we all sat down and said, ‘So what do we do? They can’t just get away with not answering us,’ ” Ms. Bennett recalled. “Charles said, ‘You know, I suppose we could just sue the Fed.’ So we went to Matt” — Matthew Winkler, Bloomberg’s executive editor — “and said, ‘What do you think about us suing the Fed?’ ” As she recounted this story, Ms. Bennett punched her left palm with her right fist — precisely, she explained, as Mr. Winkler had. She added, “He loved it.”

That was in September 2008. Just more than a year later, Mr. Pittman, a booming man with a beat reporter’s taste for whiskey, died unexpectedly at age 52. But his cause has persevered. It is now known as Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, an attempt to unlock the vault of the largest Wall Street rescue plan in decades — or, as the legal briefs put it, to “break down a wall of secrecy” that the Fed has kept in place for nearly two years in its “controversial use of public money to prop up financial institutions.”

Narrowly construed, the suit, filed in November 2008, seeks the release under FOIA of documents called term reports. Those reports contain information about the hundreds of billions of dollars the Federal Reserve lent to banks at the height of the crisis — first through its discount window and then through an acronymic soup of emergency programs with arcane-sounding names like the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility.

While the Fed does customarily release data in the aggregate about its lending — the bank bailout is about $2 trillion, all told — it has always shielded information about specific loans to specific institutions. If released, the documents in this lawsuit would punch directly through that shield: Who got money from the Fed? How much did they get? In exchange for what collateral? And under what terms?

That, said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College, would represent an unparalleled move toward openness. “It would mean that the transparency we now demand from our corporations, for example, would spread up all the way to the Fed,” he said.

In its own briefs, the Fed has argued that such disclosures could “stigmatize” financial institutions by suggesting they were desperately in need of government money and, therefore, weak. In its doomsday scenario, the Fed has worried that these weak banks could be subject to 1930s-style bank runs and that, in the future, even strong banks that were considering taking money might instead retreat in trepidation, preventing the Fed from practicing the already delicate art of monetary policy.

The Fed’s worries grew last summer when the chief federal district judge in Manhattan ruled in favor of Bloomberg News, setting up a showdown last month in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This appellate battle — which includes a similar suit by Fox News that lost in the district court — has quickly become the New York front in a bitter, two-pronged war against the Fed. (In Washington, legislation is pending to force the central bank to undergo an audit.) Indeed, as the lawsuit moved to its next round, its context was expanded by way of interventions and supporting briefs.

Now, two Manhattan tribes appear to be squaring off: On one side are the news media — among them The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which also has a FOIA bailout suit and has agreed to be bound by the Second Circuit ruling. On the other side are the banks — JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America and others — which, of course, have fallen in behind the Fed.
1340 2010-02-14 The message was clear: These musicians were simply offering works they thought were awesome, bizarre, brilliant — no matter the stylistic orientation. It is only natural that composers in the classical tradition who grew up in a world of pop would be inspired by and borrow from any style or genre: jazz, funk, rap, electronica. And performers from the new generation seem just as eager to play almost anything.

Still, the program was not all embracing. The works played here were either by complex modernists (Stockhausen, Babbitt, Berio), or younger freewheeling composers of a post-modernist bent, what the critic Greg Sandow calls the “alternative classical” music of today. Missing from the roster was anything by composers of, for want of a better word, the middle ground, what John Harbison has wryly referred to as “us notes-and-rhythms composers,” meaning those who more or less write pieces for conventional instruments, largely eschewing electronics, composers more concerned with thematic development than with instrumental atmospherics and sound collages.

I am thinking particularly of active American composers like Stephen Hartke, Steven Stucky, Joan Tower, Christopher Rouse, Melinda Wagner and Sebastian Currier, among others, mostly baby boomers; skilled, exciting and original creators. The best of them have been performed prominently and have won their share of Pulitzers. But are they already slipping from the view of young musicians and audiences?

That question came up for me during the Juilliard School’s recent Focus! festival, directed by the conductor Joel Sachs, which ended on Jan. 30. The nine-day festival, titled Music at the Center: Composing an American Mainstream, looked at an earlier generation of composers, from the middle decades of the 20th century, figures like Copland, David Diamond, Peter Mennin, Vincent Persichetti and Walter Piston. Special attention was given to William Schuman and Samuel Barber, whose centennials are being celebrated this year.

In their day all of these composers were well regarded and regularly performed. It is unfair to label them mainstream, a word that denotes middle-of-the-road, even middlebrow. Still, in comparison with the complex modernists of that era, epitomized by the intimidating Mr. Babbitt, what else could you call a Persichetti, or even a Copland, but mainstream?

I was a student at the Yale School of Music in the early 1970s when disdain toward traditionalists was rampant among many faculty and student composers. The battlefields were the tables at the pizza place next to the music building.

The arguments were mostly provoked by the work of the post-World War II modernists who believed that music had irrevocably evolved, and that systems of composition, either strictly or loosely based on 12-tone technique, represented the only viable language for the future. By the early 1970s, with Philip Glass and Steve Reich in the vanguard, the downtown scene had emerged and was winning adherents. But mainstream traditionalists who clung to tonality were treated as if they were fossils.

At Yale I felt caught in the middle. On the one hand, I was thrilled to play the piano in a student performance of Terry Riley’s exuberant minimalist masterpiece “In C.” At the same time I was learning the piano works of Schoenberg, and I was enthralled by Stravinsky’s late-period pieces that drew upon 12-tone techniques, especially “Requiem Canticles.” If I mentioned at lunch, however, that I loved pieces of a more traditional harmonic idiom, like Barber’s Piano Sonata, Piston’s Viola Concerto or Britten’s “Peter Grimes,” I would draw dismissive jibes from composers who considered such works hopelessly dated.

The emergence of the 12-tone technique was and remains one of the most important developments in 20th-century music. But the 12-tone dogma was the problem, the idea that music had to be an evolving art form in which progress would take things to a next stage.

No camp prevailed. In time the hostilities simply dissipated. Stylistic variety was embraced. But what happened to those composers in that middle ground?

In this year of Barber’s centennial, it is poignant to think of how marginalized he grew to feel. He was the polar opposite of Mr. Babbitt, who pursued composition almost as a science and did not expect the public to comprehend what he and his colleagues were up to. Barber thought that composers should connect with the public. Was that not the idea?

Something makes me worry that history is repeating itself. Are today’s centrists taken for granted, relegated, especially by the young, to the outskirts of the action? That open-minded, curious and talented young musicians are fascinated by uncompromising modernists like Charles Wuorinen makes sense. In some ways Mr. Wuorinen, 71, has a lot to answer for. In his 1979 textbook, “Simple Composition,” he declared that while the tonal system in an “atrophied or vestigial form is still used today in popular and commercial music” and by “backward-looking serious composers,” that among the serious composers of the mainstream it has “been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone system.” This pronouncement was proven wrong long ago.

But in today’s post-dogma period, without the polemics to endure, Mr. Wuorinen’s arrestingly complex works have been capturing the imaginations and challenging a new generation of musicians who have never seen his composition textbook. And composers who inventively fuse world musical traditions with elements of contemporary classical and pop styles, like Tan Dun and Osvaldo Golijov, have fashioned distinctive voices and won adherents among the young.

But what about those notes-and-rhythms composers? Take Mr. Stucky, who teaches at Cornell University and has hosted the New York Philharmonic’s Hear and Now series of preconcert talks with composers. Mr. Stucky had a banner day in September 2008 when the Dallas Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of his evening-length oratorio, “August 4, 1964,” and the New York Philharmonic performed the premiere of his “Rhapsodies for Orchestra.”

But when will New York audiences hear Mr. Stucky’s Second Concerto for Orchestra, for which he won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize?

Another example is Mr. Hartke, one of the most audaciously original and accomplished composers of today, who teaches at the University of Southern California. In 2003 Lorin Maazel conducted the New York Philharmonic in the premiere of Mr. Hartke’s Sympony No. 3, a work written in response to 9/11. And in May Gustavo Dudamel plans to conduct the premiere of Mr. Hartke’s Sympony No. 4, “Organ,” with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Yet where are his arresting chamber works on the programs of contemporary music groups in New York?

One American baby boomer composer who towers over the scene right now, embraced both as an adventurous voice and a mainstream creator, is John Adams. He retains credibility with the alternative crowd because of his early days as a minimalist. He has long since transcended that aesthetic.

I cheer the achievements and success of such composers. I only worry that pieces of more traditional excellence, like Mr. Harbison’s strings quartets, will someday be heard as seldom as works by the neglected mid-20th-century Americans that Mr. Sachs championed in the Focus! festival.

How many young musicians today, including composers, have heard, say, Norman Dello Joio’s pensive orchestral work “Meditations on Ecclesiastes,” winner of the 1957 Pulitzer Prize? Or Barber’s affecting “Hermit Songs,” written for Leontyne Price?

For now this is just a passing worry. The important news is that the end of dogma is indisputable. Empowered American musicians and composers from the new generation have it in them to foster pluralism and save classical music from itself.
1341 2010-02-14 The hero of Homer’s “Odyssey” is a modern man in ancient times, an eloquent outfoxer whose life is one long, furious act of self-invention. The embodiment of metis, or “cunning intelligence,” Odysseus adopts false identities fluidly and fully, invites a god’s wrath rather than let an act of cleverness go unknown, risks death to hear the ruinous songs of the Sirens because he cannot bear to let the opportunity pass.

The story of his 10-year journey home employs a narrative structure as complex as its protagonist and has inspired versions by writers as disparate as James Joyce, Margaret Atwood, and Joel and Ethan Coen. Now, into the tradition steps Zachary Mason with “The Lost Books of the Odyssey.”

Mason’s conceit, explained in a brief preface, is that his novel is a translation of a pre-Homeric papyrus comprising “44 concise variations on Odysseus’ story that omit stock epic formulae in favor of honing a single trope or image down to an extreme of clarity.”

It is true that more has been written and lost about the exploits of Odysseus than has been preserved, and Mason is on to something in suggesting that the Homeric version makes canonical what was once “formless, fluid, its elements shuffled into new narratives like cards in a deck.” “The Lost Books of the Odyssey,” though, would more plausibly have been excavated from the files of Jorge Luis Borges or the early drafts of Italo Calvino’s “Invisible Cities” than from Mason’s proposed “rubbish mounds of Oxyrhynchus.”

The first “lost” book, “A Sad Revelation,” begins at one of the story’s pivotal junctures, the hero’s return to Ithaca. In the Homeric version, Odysseus’ house is overrun by suitors demanding that his wife choose a new king from among them, and the hero approaches cautiously, full of strategy and subterfuge.

Here, he picks up his sword, walks home and finds a man, “soft, gray and heavy,” dozing before a fire. Penelope has followed convention and remarried. It is the least dramatic of all possible returns, and Mason captures the horror of this banal defeat. Odysseus reflects on the countless tableaus he has imagined in place of this one — a kind of Odysseus-as-Mason moment — then realizes that “what he sees before him is a vengeful illusion, the deception of some malevolent god.” He flees gleefully, a vista of endless possibility opening before hero and reader both.

In “Guest Friend,” the ruse by which Odysseus dodges assassination is less interesting than the Borgesian construct at the story’s heart: “that each man lives out his life as a character in a story told by someone else.” Silence is a mercy, granting quiet death to a distant stranger, and the mysteries of life might unravel if one could find one’s teller.

“Agamemnon and the Word” is similarly cerebral; the leader of the Greek army commands his wisest counselors to write a book explaining the world. Over several lifetimes, the king insists on ever greater brevity, until at last he predictably orders a single word, which Odysseus delivers.

The power of language and the magic of storytelling are never far from Mason’s mind. He delights particularly, and perhaps excessively, in inventing creation stories about the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey.” In one chapter, they are scripts written by the gods and double as symbols of war’s folly: “There have been innumerable Trojan wars, . . . each representing a fresh attempt at bringing the terror of battle into line with the lucidity of the authorial intent.” In another, the books are chess manuals taken to an extreme of abstraction.

A pair of rather listless tales credit Odys­seus himself. In “Fragment,” he is a habitual sower of lies, one of which is set down as the “Odyssey,” and in “The Iliad of Odysseus,” a cowardly and cruel iteration of the protagonist — Odysseus as the Trojans of Virgil’s “Aeneid” saw him — becomes a bard and distorts his minor misdeeds into heroic fare.

Mason’s prose is finely wrought, but his chapters sometimes read like intellectual exercises masquerading as stories. It is when the emphasis shifts to exploring character and theme, and “The Lost Books of the Odyssey” engages more substantively with its source material, that the novel achieves real emotional resonance. In the haunting “Epiphany,” Poseidon’s wrath becomes a cover story for Odysseus’ troubles. In truth, the affection of Odysseus’ protectress, the goddess Athena, has reached its logical conclusion: she offers herself to him, with immortality thrown into the bargain.
1342 2010-02-14 Why hasn’t there been a major New York show of Philip Taaffe, whose layered, richly colored paintings are actually taking the medium of painting in a direction it hasn’t been before? Why has a retrospective of the painter Chris Ofili — with his volatile mix of color, pattern, popular culture and identity politics — opened at the Tate Britain but not yet been scheduled for a New York museum? And why not see what a survey of the work of an artist as endlessly varied and yet dauntingly consistent as Joe Zucker — a veteran of the Post-Minimalist outfield — might look like? If the public can handle an empty museum as art, it can deal with some paintings made of cotton balls. I, for one, would rather see a tightly organized overview of Mr. Zucker’s work than Marlene Dumas’s warmed-over Expressionism, which was recently displayed in bulk at the Museum of Modern Art.

How did we get to this point? In the 1970’s the Whitney used to be committed to showing artists from across the United States; they were called regional artists in those days. That term has thankfully fallen out of fashion, but the artists have all but disappeared from museum walls. The Modern, for its part, used to present several works each by 10 to 15 artists under the rubric of its “Americans” show.

But a combination of forces threatens to herd all of our major art institutions into the same aesthetic pen. The need to raise and make money sends curators hunting for artists with international star power who work big at least some of the time, deploy multiple entertaining mediums and make for good ad campaigns (like the self-portrait featured in the MoMA ads for its coming exhibition of William Kentridge). The small show devoted to an artist who doesn’t have an immense reputation and worldwide market becomes rarer and rarer.

The consistent exposure to the big-statement solo exhibition becomes self-perpetuating, as these shows condition not only curators but the public to expect more of the same. I realize to my horror, for example, that the idea of seeing a survey of contemporary painting at the Modern makes me squirm. It would look — I don’t know — too messy and emotional, too flat, too un-MoMA.

The New Museum is a notable exception to all this. Compared with other museums in town, it deserves credit for trying to sum up recent trends outside latter-day Post-Minimalism. “Unmonumental,” its inaugural exhibition in its new building, explored recent developments in collage and assemblage, while “After Nature” plunged into a range of mediums in pursuit of a humanistic theme. Both shows sprawled to the point of incoherence but were still ambitious attempts to account for swaths of contemporary art.

The Guggenheim doesn’t play it as safe as the Modern or the Whitney. With its Sehgal show, as with its “Theanyspacewhatever” exhibition in 2008, it acts like a place where anything can happen. But shows where we encounter an artist’s single-minded, highly personal pursuit that proceeds one object at a time tend to feature past masters. The Guggenheim’s recent, fantastic Kandinsky exhibition was an example (as was the Modern’s Ensor show). Yet there are plenty of artists working this way now. They may not be making history (or entertainment, either), but they are still making really good art whose very unfolding has its own integrity and is exciting to see.

I wouldn’t have a problem with these shows of the gods and godlings of Post-Minimalism if they were balanced and mixed with other stuff that is completely different. But that other stuff is largely missing in New York museums, though there is plenty of it around.

It is amazing that some aspect of Laura Owens’s or Dana Schutz’s work is not thought worth some kind of small, well-organized museum show. The same goes for Lari Pittman, who could sustain something larger. European artists, who bring a little more wit and accessibility to Post-Minimalism, include Rosemarie Trockel and Fischli & Weiss. Someone should do a show of the early paintings of Peter Doig.

And there is more demolition work to be done on the master narratives of the recent past. It would be interesting to see how the eccentric California painter Roy De Forest holds up, what with the several returns of representation and of painting since he emerged. Similarly, the midcentury West Coast painter David Park — more than Richard Diebenkorn — could do with another New York retrospective. He’s the kind of artist who can light a fire under a young artist and also teach the public a great deal about looking at painting, a skill we seem to be in danger of losing.

The paintings of John Wesley, an elder statesman of alternative Pop Art, were seen in quantity at the Venice Biennale; he had a retrospective at P.S. 1 in 2000 but has never had a show of any size in a Manhattan museum. Other deserving painters who emerged in the 1940s and 1950s, often working small and usually beyond the pale of Abstract Expressionism, include Alice Trumbull Mason, Beauford Delaney, Steve Wheeler, Loren MacIver and Lois Dodd — who, by the way, is still making art.

You’d never know from looking at museums that figurative painting, running the gamut from realist to quasi-expressionist, is on the rise. (Speaking of which, if some New York curator didn’t see Nicole Eisenman’s recent show at Leo Koenig and at least consider doing a show, we are in trouble.) Some kind of local museum attention could be given to the realist painter Rackstraw Downes, the abstract painters Thomas Nozkowski, Larry Poons and Stanley Whitney, or to an artist like Dona Nelson, who refuses to commit to either camp and whose eccentricities are a good match for Joe Zucker’s. These painters seem slated to become the forgotten artists of the future. David Bates is having a perfectly interesting career without any attention from the New York art establishment, thank you very much.

New York missed out on a recent retrospective of the cantankerous political surrealist Peter Saul. A survey of the work of the painter Jim Nutt — our era’s crazed answer to the Northern Renaissance — being organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, does not yet have a New York stop. And it has finally been determined that the long overdue survey of the abstract ceramicist Ken Price that has been undertaken by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will come to the Metropolitan Museum. I’m glad it will be seen here, but the fact that the Guggenheim, the Whitney and the Modern could not fit it into their schedules shows an appalling narrowness of vision. I don’t care how many scheduling conflicts can be cited.

If this sounds harsh, let me also say that I think curators of contemporary art in New York museums have some of the toughest jobs in the art world. They rarely seem able to act on their own without some kind of committee oversight and are under unbelievable pressure to succeed at the box office. Museum gallery space is at a premium and is almost uniformly unforgiving. Excepting the idiosyncratic flexibility of the Guggenheim’s ramp, there is barely a decent gallery among our main museums, although we seem to have stopped talking about the effect this has on curators, their exhibitions and thus on the seeing and comprehending of art.

New York museum curators also have to compete with New York galleries, which are out there discovering new and overlooked artists and — increasingly — mounting invaluable historical shows. At the same time the amount of inspiration and information curators can gain from galleries is unparalleled. However, gathering it requires spending more time seeing shows beyond the six or eight galleries whose artists get most of the big museum shows these days. The idea that a moment’s most visible artists are concentrated in a handful of powerful galleries is only superficially true. By now we know too much not to willfully work against this notion.

Museum curators need to think less about an artist’s career, its breakthroughs and its place in the big picture and more in terms of an artist’s life’s work pursued over time with increasing concentration and singularity.

They have a responsibility to their public and to history to be more ecumenical, to do things that seem to come from left field. They owe it to the public to present a balanced menu that involves painting as well as video and photography and sculpture. They need to think outside the hive-mind, both distancing themselves from their personal feelings to consider what’s being wrongly omitted and tapping into their own subjectivity to show us what they really love.

These things should be understood by now: The present is diverse beyond knowing, history is never completely on anyone’s side, and what we ignore today will be excavated later and held against us the way we hold previous oversights against past generations.

Message to curators: Whatever you’re doing right now, do something else next.

1358 2010-02-15 Joseph Altuzarra is a Swarthmore-educated Paris-bred son of an American mother and a French father. Prabal Gurung grew up in Katmandu and trained at Bill Blass. At 25, Alexander Wang is the hitmaker of contemporary urban fashion, his $25-million business already surpassing that of many established designers.

If fashion didn’t routinely select a new group of designers to acclaim, it wouldn’t be fashion. There must always be someone waiting in the wings, the “next” one. These three designers now appear to be the leading candidates.

It is clear that Mr. Wang has managed to give his collections the properties of high fashion — top models; coveted accessories; a cool, insolent sensibility — while making affordable clothes that many women, not just skinny hipsters, can wear. His show again achieved the illusion of being something more than a contemporary-priced collection. With their matted hair and vacant gazes, the models, led by Natalia Vodianova, looked possessed by zombies, but you can bet that people will wonder when they can get their hands on the elephant-belled thigh-high tights that Mr. Wang showed with his miniskirts and platform boots. Like an old-fashioned merchant, Mr. Wang knows how to get value out of a single item.

The collection drew heavily on deconstructed tailoring: pinstripe blazers and vests lopped off at the midriff, blended with a furry layer or a broken lace top and a pair of boy trousers with part of the waistband snipped away. If it sounds a little tricky, with many extra parts, it was. Traditional garments of power and formality were the sources for swallowtail minidresses and camel wool clergy capes, and the general gloominess. Still, the collection was an ambitious step up for Mr. Wang, and despite the moving parts, it looked polished.

Mr. Gurung has a knack for the languid, jazzy tailoring of a Blass or a Saint Laurent, his spiritual mentors, and that feeling was captured in a fresh way in his first show last February. He also demonstrated in the next season that he could do chic dresses in double-silk satin with pleats and peplums.

So he didn’t need to repeat himself this time. While most of the day clothes were fairly solid — two-tone coats and suits in cashmere with curvilinear lines, boxy metallic tweed blazers — the ruffled evening looks didn’t seem new and indeed looked a bit tortured. A lanky jacket, shown with pants, that combined fox, mink and broadtail captured the lighter, offhand attitude that Mr. Gurung first conveyed, and to which he should return.
1359 2010-02-15 After attending Parsons and working for Bill Blass, Prabal Gurung started his own line. He discussed his fall 2010 collection, shown at New York Fashion Week, with The Times's Eric Wilson.
1360 2010-02-15 “They typically do not exhibit at non-Apple events, but we would very much like to have them join us,” said Claire Cranton, a spokeswoman for the GSM Association, the organizer of the annual Barcelona convention. “Apple products will be highly visible at the show.”

Apple has leapfrogged its Asian rivals to become the world’s third-largest maker of smartphones, the fastest-growing part of the mobile phone market. As of December, Apple had a 16.4 percent share of the market, behind Nokia and Research In Motion, which makes the BlackBerry, according to Strategy Analytics. And Apple is growing faster than either one.

Apple’s ’s growing influence on the global mobile industry stems from the way the iPhone convinced consumers to use wireless data. Wireless carriers worldwide have been seeking to increase their revenue from data use, like texting or browsing the Web, as the revenue from voice calls decline. The iPhone’s 133,000 apps increase data use.

“With the iPhone, Apple has changed the paradigm of the mobile phone industry, just as Apple changed the MP3 industry with the iPod,” said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm. “They have shifted the focus from the technology to the services.”

The new iPhone 3GS will be part of the official display of T-Mobile, the wireless unit of Deutsche Telekom, which sells the device in 12 countries and is the exclusive seller in Germany.

Michael Hagspihl, a T-Mobile vice president in Bonn in charge of relations with cellphone makers, said the iPhone had brought T-Mobile 1.2 million new customers in Germany. “It’s been a real success for us,” Mr. Hagspihl said. “The iPhone has brought lots of new customers to our network, and our data consumption has gone through the roof.”

Should Apple ever decide to sell the iPhone through multiple operators in the United States, T-Mobile USA would definitely be interested, Mr. Hagspihl said.

So far, AT&T has the exclusive American rights to the iPhone.

But in France and Britain, Apple ended exclusive relationships and is selling the iPhone through several operators besides its original partners, France Télécom’s Orange and Telefónica’s O2.

Even after losing the exclusive selling rights in France, Orange has had no decline in iPhone sales, said Cynthia Gordon, an Orange vice president who oversees the relationship with Apple.

“Apple has had a major impact on the overall market and a very positive impact on Orange’s business,” Ms. Gordon said.

Orange is one of Apple’s biggest operator partners, Ms. Gordon said.

The French operator sells the iPhone in 29 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Through October, Orange had sold 1.7 million iPhones, which she said was more than any other operator in Europe and Africa.

IPhone sales are helping Orange offset declines in voice revenue, Ms. Gordon said.

“It has been a platform for us to build on our own sales,” she said. Besides attracting new customers and retaining old ones, the iPhone allowed Orange to develop the Orange TV Player, a programming application for viewing 60 TV channels on the iPhone in France.

Apple and Orange developed the application together, she said.
1361 2010-02-15 VANCOUVER, British Columbia — To the surprise of no one, including dozens of cheering, flag-waving Chinese fans, the American women’s hockey team, in its first game of these Olympics, breezed to a 12-1 victory over China on Sunday.

Jenny Potter, 31, the oldest player on the team and a married mother of two, had three goals, making her the leading Olympic scorer, male or female, in American hockey history. Meghan Duggan had two goals, and Jocelyn Lamoureux scored a YouTube keeper, dragging the puck between her legs with the toe of her stick and then feinting a backhand before burying the puck between the goalie’s legs.

This was not a blowout on the order of Canada’s 18-0 rout of Slovakia on Saturday, but it was one-sided all the same. China had trouble breaking the puck out against aggressive American forechecking and played most of the game in its own end. The Chinese goalie, Yao Shi, faced 61 shots, and the damage could have been worse if the American shooters cycling around the goalmouth and sniping pretty much at will had been more accurate.

All told, 14 American skaters had at least a point. The only blot on their record was a late third-period Chinese power-play goal by Fengling Jin against the third-string American goalie, Brianne McLaughlin, who replaced the starter, Molly Schaus, with eight minutes left. The many Canadians in attendance roared their approval.

“You don’t ever like to beat a team, 12-1,” Natalie Darwitz, the American captain, said, adding, “I think we got a little sloppy there in the middle and the end. It’s kind of a tough game when you’re controlling the play and it gets to be about goals and points. You get away from doing the little things.”

Asked afterward if women’s Olympic hockey should institute a mercy rule, the American coach, Mark Johnson, paused a moment and then said, “No.” But he added: “I get uncomfortable when the score gets lopsided. I’ve been on the other side of the equation both as a player and as a coach. It can be a difficult balancing act. You certainly want to respect your opponent and the hard work they did to get here. At some point it becomes uncomfortable, so you try to do the things that make the team stronger, get something out of the game, and move on.”
1362 2010-02-15 Pitchers and catchers report to spring training in a few days, which means diehard fans are gearing up for an annual ritual: the start of ticket sales for individual games.

In Boston and Chicago in particular, where the Red Sox and the Cubs are intensely popular, the ballparks are famously small and the high proportion of season-ticket holders has reduced the number of individual-game tickets available, fans feel the pressure to immediately get online and buy seats before it is too late.

But the Cubs are adding a twist this year. On Monday, fans will be able to buy tickets to every Cubs home game, but at a premium of 20 percent over the face value, or 15 percent if they pay with a MasterCard. The MasterCard First Chance Presale will last until Thursday and include an undisclosed percentage of the pool of the Cubs’ single-game tickets.

On Friday, any remaining tickets will be sold at face value (with the usual assortment of fees).

The Cubs said they introduced the presale for fans with specific dates in mind — like a game on someone’s birthday. They figure fans will pay the premium for the assurance of being able to attend the game they want and to avoid potentially paying more from ticket resellers like StubHub.

“We believe there are fans who will pay extra, just like they’ll pay for a Fast Pass at the amusement park,” said Wally Hayward, the Cubs’ chief marketing officer. He said he was unaware of another team that holds a similar sale. “There’s a tremendous demand for Cubs tickets, especially from people coming from out of town, when there are games you must have.”
1363 2010-02-15 His name is Alchemy  a sleek Irish red and white setter, full of energy but gentle.

Starting Monday, he will represent one of three new breeds making their debut at the Westminster Kennel Club’s world-class dog show alongside the perennial Labrador retriever  just named the United States’ top dog for the 19th consecutive year  and dozens of other breeds.

Alchemy, a silky-coated canine from New Jersey, will also step outside Madison Square Garden on Tuesday to ring the closing bell at the Nasdaq stock exchange. That moment will be beamed live to a Times Square giant screen.

The two other breeds entering the annual show for the first time are herding dogs  the Pyrenean shepherd and the Norwegian buhund.

“It’s exciting for me to see beautiful dogs that finally get recognized in this country after being around hundreds of years in their home countries,” said David Frei, a spokesman for the club who co-hosts the show’s live television broadcast.

The so-called Pyr shep, native to the mountains of southern France, has guarded sheep since medieval times. Its expressive, intelligent eyes guide a fuzzy, sturdy body in action. The breed comes in two varieties: rough- and smooth-coated. Hundreds of them lost their lives in World War I, searching for wounded men or serving as couriers or guard dogs.

The loyal and fun-loving buhund  either black or cream-colored, with a curly tail  also has existed for centuries, sailing on Viking ships and working in the Norwegian countryside.

“It’s a dog with pointed ears and a thick coat who looks like it’s ready to go to work on a farm, herding,” Frei said. “They have a great work ethic.”

Represented by 29 individual dogs in the show, the three breeds made it into the 134th annual event after being officially recognized last year by the American Kennel Club, the governing body of the purebred dog sport in the United States.

Several factors are required for A.K.C. recognition: a solid parent club that oversees the registry, a precise standard for the breed’s ideal dog and a sufficient population and distribution in the United States.

“They can’t all be on some farm in Georgia,” Frei joked.

Worldwide, more than 400 breeds of dogs are recognized. The three new breeds in this show have long been accepted abroad, but “it took this long for them to receive A.K.C. recognition in this country,” Frei said.

On Wednesday, the Labrador retriever was named the top dog in the United States by the American Kennel Club, followed by the German shepherd, the Yorkshire terrier and the golden retriever. The ranking is based on the number of registrations for the breed with the A.K.C. in 2009; the lab is most popular in Los Angeles.

Westminster’s 2010 rookie breeds were introduced Friday in the lobby of Hotel Pennsylvania, across the street from the Garden. They are staying with their owners in rooms equipped with special “dogpedic beds,” said Jerry Grymek, the hotel’s “doggie concierge.”

There are 173 breeds and varieties in the show, up from about 150 two decades ago, Frei said.

“This is the world’s greatest dog show, with a different cast of characters every year,” he said.

Anna Jones is bringing 9-year-old Alchemy along with another Irish red and white setter, 2-year-old Toffy, after a string of other shows this past year that won the dogs enough points to be declared A.K.C. champions, a requirement to step on Westminster’s green carpet.

The red and white setter  an older breed than the well-known mahogany-coated Irish setter  is a lean, elegant hunting dog with a mouth soft enough to retrieve game without damaging it. The breed became almost extinct in the early 20th century, but was saved by its “fanciers,” Frei said.

The Westminster show is the nation’s second-longest continually held sporting event, after the Kentucky Derby, Frei said.

The Pyrenean shepherd and the Norwegian buhund will compete Monday as part of the herding group. The setters will compete Tuesday in the sporting group.
1364 2010-02-15 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Two missiles fired from an American drone aircraft killed at least six militants in North Waziristan on Sunday, Pakistani security officials said.

American drone attacks have recently increased in the region, on the border with Afghanistan, which is the main hub of Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban faction led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose fighters are involved in attacks against NATO and American forces in Afghanistan.

The target of the attack on Sunday was a compound in the town of Mir Ali. The identity of those killed was not clear.

The Pakistani military is currently involved in an offensive in South Waziristan, the base of the Pakistani Taliban, but is under increasing pressure from the United States to expand the offensive to North Waziristan.

American officials also believe that the top leadership of the Pakistani Taliban has fled the Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan and is currently hiding in the North. The Pakistani Taliban had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack on a C.I.A. base in Khost, Afghanistan, in December, killing eight people.

The American drone attacks have increased since then, and one last month is thought to have killed the leader of Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud. The Taliban insists he is still alive.

Pakistan says it will take six months to a year to be able to start an operation in North Waziristan.

1382 2010-02-16 Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia congratulated Viktor F. Yanukovich on Monday for winning Ukraine’s presidential election, well after many other world leaders had done so. But Mr. Putin may have had his reasons for delaying. In 2004, he was accused of meddling in Ukraine’s affairs by making a similar call to Mr. Yanukovich while the presidential election results were still being contested. Mr. Yanukovich’s campaign was accused of fraud, the election was thrown out and the Orange Revolution happened. This time, Mr. Putin waited until Mr. Yanukovich’s victory was certified.
1383 2010-02-16 Dubai’s police chief said Monday that an 11-person team of trained killers with European passports carried out the mysterious assassination of a senior Hamas official last month in a Dubai hotel. The chief, Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan al-Tamim, provided names and photographs of the suspects, along with a detailed account of how they tracked the Hamas official, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, and suffocated him within minutes of his arrival on Jan. 19 at Al Bustan Rotana hotel, near the international airport. The suspects, who disguised themselves with wigs and fake beards, left Dubai immediately after the killing on separate airlines, the chief said. He also said that two Palestinian suspects in the case were arrested in Jordan and extradited to Dubai, where they are now in custody. Mr. Mabhouh played a role in the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers in 1989. Hamas has accused Israel of his killing, and has vowed to retaliate.
1384 2010-02-16 Shahar Peer, an Israeli player who was denied a visa so she could compete in the Dubai Tennis Championships last year, won her opening match in this year’s tournament, rallying to beat 15th-ranked Yanina Wickmayer, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5. Authorities cited safety reasons for preventing Peer from playing last year, with tournament organizers saying they feared fan anger over Israel’s three-week military offensive in Gaza. Organizers were fined $300,000 by the WTA after denying her the opportunity to play.
1385 2010-02-16 Afterward, Pavel Datsyuk declined to say whether the color-coded groups would remain together for the rest of the Olympics.

“Ask the coach,” he said.

But the groupings suggested some surprising thinking on the part of the Russian coaching staff. Sergei Fedorov, Slava Kozlov and Alexander Radulov, who all play in the Kontinental Hockey League, were together, but Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin and Ilya Kovalchuk — the three best players on the team and potentially a devastating line — were not. Instead, Ovechkin was with Datsyuk and Alexander Semin, who is Ovechkin’s teammate on the Washington Capitals.

This philosophy of keeping together players who are used to one another is one employed by several teams. Canada Coach Mike Babcock, for example, appeared to be keeping together the line of Joe Thornton, Patrick Marleau and Dany Heatley, who all play for the San Jose Sharks.

Talking about how the problem of getting the lines to click on short notice, Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Flames and Canada said: “The coaching staff talks to us, and they’ve already been thinking about the role they want each of us to play. They’ve put the lines together, and some of the guys have already played together.”

Ron Wilson, the United States coach, likened the process of putting together a team on one day’s notice to a riddle.

“It’s like a Rubik’s cube,” he said, speaking with reporters at Canada Hockey Place. “You just start moving it till you get a side with one color all the same.”

Wilson arrived in Vancouver late Saturday night with a few players, but the rest of the team arrived late Sunday night and into the wee hours of Monday morning, he said.

Wilson said that much had changed since the team’s orientation camp last summer. One example involved Ryan Kesler of Vancouver, who became an unexpectedly productive scorer.

“Ryan Kesler has the most power-play goals in our group, and we weren’t thinking of him so much as a power-play guy — more of a penalty killer,” Wilson said. But Wilson had not yet spoken to Kesler about anything specific.

“I haven’t individually sat down with players to explain their roles,” Wilson said, “but they can see generally their situation by the lineup they saw in our presentation today. But I also told them that’s only where we’re starting. Things are going to change by how we play and how each individual plays.”

John Tortorella, the Rangers’ coach, who is an assistant for the United States and is in charge of its power play, talked about how to set up a system.

“You don’t,” he said. “You do the best you can. But we’re not trying to reinvent anything, just get out of the way and let the players play.”

One thing Wilson said he was certain about was the goaltending.

“Ryan Miller is our starting goalie,” he said. “I haven’t spoken to the other goalies. I’ve only spoken to Ryan. I actually called him last week during the Super Bowl at halftime, and I told him that he was the starting goalie so he would not worry about it this week.”

Wilson said it was “really hard to play well defensively and cohesively in less than a week,” adding extra importance to the No. 1 goalie position.

“I’ll talk to the other guys and have them alternate a little bit as backup,” Wilson said, referring to Tim Thomas and Jonathan Quick.

For the players, the short turnaround from N.H.L. team to national team comes with the territory.

“That’s just the nature of the business, I guess,” said Ryan Suter of the Nashville Predators and an alternate captain with the United States. “But hockey’s a simple game when you play hard, so we’re going to go play hard.”
1386 2010-02-16 Fog may come on little cat feet and sit on silent haunches before moving on, as the poet Carl Sandburg wrote, but in central and Northern California it plops its bulk down on the state’s redwoods and makes itself quite comfortable.

Frequent summer fog along the coast from Monterey to the Oregon border helps nurture the coast, or California, redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), which inhabits a narrow north-south band in that region.

The fog, however, is less frequent than it used to be, according to a study by James A. Johnstone and Todd E. Dawson of the University of California at Berkeley. And that may be stressing the tall trees, they write in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Coastal fog in California is produced by a combination of factors, including upwelling of cool ocean water and atmospheric inversions that trap humid air at low altitudes. To obtain a historical record of coastal fog, the researchers looked at data on ceiling heights recorded hourly at several airports from 1951 to 2008. And they extrapolated back to 1901 using long-term land temperature data.

Their central finding is that since the early 20th century, fog frequency in summers has declined by about one-third.

Redwoods lose a lot of water through transpiration, and rely on the high humidity in fog to slow, stop or even reverse the process. So less fog, the researchers say, means the trees have less ability to conserve water during the drier summer months.
1387 2010-02-16 “Europe has become a huge welfare state for everybody, for states as well as individuals,” he said.

Greece’s finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, told his counterparts on Monday that a firmer commitment to helping his country was needed to fend off speculators. Other ministers in the euro zone lectured Greece about using complex financial instruments prepared by Wall Street to hide debt and called for a tighter clampdown on spending, rather than outlining the specifics of an aid package that would calm markets.

European leaders want to extract guarantees from the Greeks to put their finances in order before offering any kind of rescue, but their reticence also stems from the fact that any price tag will have to be defended at home.

Here in Germany, opinion surveys show that two-thirds of the people oppose financial assistance for Greece. More ominously, a survey released Sunday by the newspaper Bild showed that a slight majority of Germans, 53 percent, said they favored expelling Greece from the euro group entirely if its mountain of debt threatened the stability of the currency union.

“Every country has its own debts,” said Kristin Lautenschläger, 70, a retiree in Berlin who said she opposed spending German money to save Greece. “Germany is no longer such a rich country anymore, and has its own problems to deal with before it can take care of Greece’s.”

Germans spent the past decade cutting unemployment benefits and freezing pensions, while grudgingly accepting stagnant wages in order to make their economy more competitive. After those years of sacrifice, it is more than just a matter of money that is driving opposition to the bailout, but also a matter of principle, after politicians promised they would never have to prop up their neighbors.

The crisis could not have come at a worse moment for Chancellor Angela Merkel. At the outset of the financial crisis, Mrs. Merkel confidently called it an American problem, and resisted as much as possible calls from across the Atlantic for even more government spending to kick-start economic growth.

Now with the American economy in the midst of a more robust, if still fragile, recovery, the Germany economy has stalled, with no growth in the fourth quarter, according to an announcement Friday by the government statistics office.

“There was a belief in the beginning that this was an American problem. I don’t think the dots were connected across Europe, that you have the unpredictability within the zone itself,” said Jackson Janes, executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

“Now they have to pay for Greece and everybody’s trying to figure out how you can do that while staying politically viable at home,” Mr. Janes said.

In Germany, the debate over aid to the Greeks intensified last week when the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled that unpopular labor-market reforms, known as Hartz IV, may have gone too far in cutting benefits for the country’s unemployed. That set off a political fight within the German government over jobless assistance, one that was inevitably framed as helping Germans or saving Greeks.

“I can’t explain to a Hartz IV recipient that he won’t get another cent but some Greek gets to retire at 63,” said Michael Fuchs, a deputy leader in Parliament of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democrats, in Sunday’s issue of the newspaper Die Welt.

The lack of common fiscal policies for the bloc meant built-in instability for the euro, but years without a major recession covered it up.

Now it is clear that unlike the United States, where the federal government has the power to help individual states, Europe lacks the mechanisms to steady its struggling nations, and the uncertainty is causing some critics to call the very future of the currency union into question.

“We’re not worried about the U.S. economy disintegrating as a result of California being temporarily ungovernable and needing an austerity plan,” said Adam Posen, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

A bailout for Greece would not be as expensive as the fraught public debate might suggest, Mr. Posen said.

“The amount of additional fiscal aid needed for Greece is not that great,” he said. “Politically it’s sensitive, but economically the costs are vastly overrated versus the benefits accrued to date and to come.”

But voters in Germany see the decision to bail out Greece as just the first step in what will be a long line of countries seeking handouts. “After Greece it will just be other countries like Portugal,” said Patrick Klomfas, 28, an unemployed automotive engineer, who on Monday was visiting the employment office in the Berlin neighborhood of Lichtenberg.

“But you know, the politicians are just going to do what they want to do anyway,” said Mr. Klomfas, who has been out of work since October, but expects to start a new job next month. “No one wanted the euro, but the euro came anyway.”
1388 2010-02-16 But the update does no favors for Isabella, whose insistence on maintaining her sexual purity seems even more priggish in an implicit contemporary context. Nor does Elisabeth Waterston’s strident performance in the role help solve the central problem the character poses. To wit, how to make Isabella’s virginity-first campaign seem the result of unworldliness and innocence rather than a blinkered, self-righteous rectitude?

Dressed like a schoolmarm in a gray skirt that practically laps at her ankles, the lanky Ms. Waterston all but symbolizes an unbending uprightness. Pleading with Angelo to spare her brother, Claudio (LeRoy McClain), who has been sentenced to death for impregnating his betrothed, Juliet (Rose Seccareccia), Ms. Waterston’s Isabella strikes a hectoring tone that makes Angelo’s sudden attraction especially peculiar. (Although Mr. Sisto’s self-lacerating horror as Angelo confesses the attraction suggests that he may have a masochistic tendency.)

And when the doomed Claudio, whose fear and uncertainty in the face of death is rendered with moving passion by Mr. McClain, gently suggests that there are moral gray areas to be considered, Isabella’s shrill denunciation closes off any sympathy we might feel for her plight. The performance lacks the warmth and tenderness needed to leaven Isabella’s rigid ethics.

Almost everywhere you look in “Measure for Measure,” people are dissembling, deceiving and disguising their natures. The character who most wholly embodies the slipperiness Shakespeare explores in the play is probably Lucio (a subtly oily Alfredo Narciso), who delights in stirring almost every one of the plots with a soiled finger.

An inveterate liar with a blithe lack of scruples and a pushy tongue, he nevertheless awakens the Duke to the unwelcome truths about the possible divergence between private behavior and public appearance, as well as the harshness of the Duke’s high-minded ideals. Lucio’s sardonic observation that sexual license will not be ended “till eating and drinking be put down” is more funny than — and just as true as — any of the windier nuggets of wisdom the Duke imparts.

These confidences come to the Duke not in his role as ruler but in his assumed disguise as the friendly friar who acts to help thwart Angelo’s brutal justice. The good Duke, in his way, is almost as slippery as the bad Lucio, and Mr. Mays brings a kaleidoscopic array of shadings to the character. Mr. Mays’s freighted, ruminative tone in the early scenes, as the Duke hands over power to a man he professes to esteem, suggests that the Duke has misgivings already. Mr. Mays also makes clear the secret delight the Duke takes in playing dress-up.

The verse is spoken with a light lucidity that brightens even the more philosophically dense passages. But most affecting is the uncertainty in Mr. Mays’s expressive blue eyes, first awakened when he hears Escalus (the fine Robert Langdon Lloyd) describe the Duke as “one that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.” The Duke’s discovery of Angelo’s perfidy, it seems, has sown doubts about his own character too.

Particularly effective in the supporting comic roles are John Keating as Pompey, forever looking quizzical at the sudden onset of rectitude in a licentious town, and John Christopher Jones as the sense-mangling constable Elbow.

But only Mr. Sisto’s memorable Angelo truly stands out from the busy traffic of the convoluted plot. Some of Shakespeare’s most deeply dyed villains are his most richly human characters. (Shylock plays the role of nemesis in “The Merchant of Venice,” classified as a comedy.)

Mr. Sisto does not stint on revealing Angelo’s sinister aspects — the businesslike determination with which he pursues his corrupt ends is creepy and chilling — but when guilt and shame gnaw at his heart, Mr. Sisto’s Angelo moves us more than anyone else in the play. While others transgress lightly or loosely, Angelo knows well the horror of what he does, and must do it anyway.

1389 2010-02-16 “I looked to see what it means to add sports to girls’ lives,” she said. “How does it change things for them?”

States with large boys’ sports programs had to make bigger changes to achieve parity than states with smaller programs. Looking at the state-by-state statistics allowed Dr. Stevenson to narrow her focus, comparing differences in sports participation with differences in women’s educational and work achievement.

So her study untangles the effects of sports participation from other confounding factors — school size, climate, social and personal differences among athletes — and comes far closer to determining a cause and effect relationship between high school sports participation and achievement later in life.

Using a complex analysis, Dr. Stevenson showed that increasing girls’ sports participation had a direct effect on women’s education and employment. She found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women’s education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women.

“It’s not just that the people who are going to do well in life play sports, but that sports help people do better in life,” she said, adding, “While I only show this for girls, it’s reasonable to believe it’s true for boys as well.”

Another question is whether Title IX has made a difference in women’s long-term health. In a carefully conducted study, Robert Kaestner, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, compared rates of obesity and physical activity of women who had been in high school in the 1970s — as Title IX was taking effect — with similar women from earlier years. Controlling the results for other influences, like age and changing diets, Dr. Kaestner was able to tease out the effects Title IX had on women’s health.

He found that the increase in girls’ athletic participation caused by Title IX was associated with a 7 percent lower risk of obesity 20 to 25 years later, when women were in their late 30s and early 40s. His article was published this month in the journal Evaluation Review.

Dr. Kaestner notes that while a 7 percent decline in obesity is modest, no other public health program can claim similar success. And other studies have shown that even a small drop in weight can lower risk for diabetes and other health problems.

There is still room for improvement. Today about 1 in 3 high school girls play sports, compared with about half of all boys. And participation varies widely by state, according to Dr. Stevenson’s research. Southern states like Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee still have big gender gaps, while Northern states like Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Vermont are closer to parity.

“While we have more girls than ever before, we still have far more boys playing sports than girls,” said Nicole M. LaVoi, associate director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota. “The research clearly states that when anybody, boys and girls, are physically active, they can reap developmental and health benefits. But we haven’t reached equality yet.”
1390 2010-02-16 Iran’s statement to the council was “strikingly at odds with the reality on the ground,” Mr. Posner said later, adding that the challenge now was to “figure out what we can do to help those people that are being tortured in the prisons.”

“We’re going to continue to press it as many other governments are,” Mr. Posner said.

Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Peter Gooderham, called on Iran to invite Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to investigate post-election violence and assess the state of human rights and to accept a visit by the United Nations’ top human rights official, Navi Pillay.

“Grave human rights violations continue to be committed,” Mr. Gooderham said.

France’s ambassador, Jean-Baptiste Mattei, saying that Iran had launched “a bloody repression” of its own population, also called on Iran to accept an independent international investigation.

At a follow-up Human Rights Council session on Wednesday, Iran is scheduled to state which recommendations it intends to pursue. But officials have already ruled out the notion of an external investigation.

“That’s totally out of the question,” Seyyed Hossein Rezvani, the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s deputy director-general for human rights, told The Associated Press, saying that Iran had numerous domestic mechanisms for handling such issues.

Iran, which is expected to seek membership of the 47-member Human Rights Council in elections in May, may seek to be receptive to some requests, human rights organizations said.

In his statement to the council, Mr. Larijani said Iran had fully cooperated with the United Nations’ human rights mechanisms and had invited Ms. Pillay, the human rights commissioner, to visit the country. Ms. Pillay’s spokesman, Rupert Colville, confirmed that Mr. Larijani had issued the invitation on Friday. Ms. Pillay responded that she would be unable to visit before 2011 and suggested that a team from her office be allowed to visit Iran first. Mr. Larijani had not yet responded to that suggestion, Mr. Colville said.

Human rights groups said Iran’s claims of cooperation with the United Nations were exaggerated. No Human Rights Council official has visited the country since 2005, and numerous requests from special investigators remained unanswered, said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director of Amnesty International’s Middle East program.

“What we heard today was blanket denials and a lot of cynicism,” Ms. Sahraoui said, adding that Mr. Larijani’s report on human rights was less revealing than information provided by authorities in Tehran, where official figures show that 47 people have died in political violence and up to 5,000 people have been arrested. Figures recorded by Amnesty International also show two people have been executed for political offenses and nine others sentenced to death, she said.

But, she added, “what we heard today was everything is fine.”
1391 2010-02-16 The result brought all kinds of firsts. It was the first Olympic men’s Alpine gold medal for a Swiss since 1988 when Pirmin Zurbriggen won the downhill. Miller’s bronze medal, coupled with the two silver medals he won at the 2002 Winter Games, made him the first American Alpine skier to win three Olympic medals. It was also the first time no Austrian was on the men’s downhill podium since 1994, which is also the last time an American was on the podium.

For Defago, his victorious run in 1 minute 54.31 seconds was the defining moment in a solid career and validated his victories on consecutive weekends last year at Wengen, the longest downhill on the World Cup circuit, and Kitzbühel, the most fearsome downhill in the world.

For Svindal, it was a first Olympic medal, earned two years after a career-threatening injury sustained in a horrific crash.

And for Miller, it might have brought closure to his 2006 misadventure at the Turin Olympics. Miller not only did what he did not do in Italy — win a medal — he finally offered an explanation for his inglorious Olympics four years ago by comparing it with his experience this week.

“In Torino, I was ready to win and I executed some things well, but I wasn’t emotionally involved,” Miller said. “I treated the races very cold and clinical. Today, you could feel the nervous energy. It really felt like the Olympics. Capturing some of that Olympic environment and using it to inspire me was one of the reasons I wanted to come back to the Olympics.”

He might have won with a little more light at the top of the race course. The first 15 skiers charged onto the course in shadows beneath a cloudy sky which made it hard to pick up the small bumps and rollers in the first section of the race course, known as Caddy Flats.

Miller, who skied eighth in the field of 64, nonetheless tied Defago for the fastest time through that earliest section. Miller, in fact, was tied or won each of the first four timed intervals. But in the bottom fifth of the race course, he had the third-fastest time. Defago was first in that section and Svindal was second, hence the close finish.

Defago, like all the Swiss skiers, took a different line through the late section known as Coaches Corner. The Swiss turned wide well before the gate — going early as ski racers say — and hugging close to the first gate in the right-hand turn. Virtually all the other skiers, including Miller, were several yards wide of the same gate.

It was at this section that Defago very likely won the race.

“Bode was pushing hard and skiing smart, too,” said Sasha Rearick, the United States ski team men’s head coach. “But the snow at the bottom was softer, and it just didn’t respond the same way to him.”

Miller, appearing in his third Games, made very little of setting the American Alpine record for Olympic medals.

“It is what it is,” he said with a shrug and a smile. “I could have been fourth very easily and I still would have been psyched about the way I skied.”

Miller will have four more opportunities to add to his medal total, beginning with the super combined Tuesday.

The 32-year-old Defago, who became the oldest man to win the downhill, called his gold medal “the apex of all my work.”

He added, “I have had a good career but this is what I was missing and it was always my goal.”

As well as Defago has skied, only Cuche and Janka — winners of World Cup downhills this season — were granted spots in the Olympic downhill before arriving in Whistler. Defago did not qualify until he finished in the top 10 of Thursday’s men’s downhill training.

“I know this is a surprise to some people,” Defago, a father of two, said. “But not to me. I told my family I wanted to bring home a little more weight in my luggage. Just a little, like something gold.”
1392 2010-02-16 But other religious workers are operating in a far more bare-bones manner, with whatever they managed to carry in their luggage.

“You had missionary doctors parachuting in here doing amputations rather than setting or treating wounds because they knew their charter jet was leaving in two days and they would not be able to oversee follow-up,” said Dr. Scott Nelson, an American orthopedic surgeon and Adventist missionary, as he lifted a moaning man onto a soiled stretcher.

“The community trusts us, but when other groups make shortsighted decisions it undermines everyone’s credibility,” he added.

Dr. Nelson and other veteran missionaries faulted the new arrivals for frequently acting on their own instead of collaborating with more established missionary groups that plan on staying in Haiti for the long haul. It is tension, some experts say, that can arise from the differing reasons that missions have for being here.

“The new or short-term groups see themselves as being there to save souls first and lives second,” said Jonathan J. Bonk, director of the Overseas Ministries Study Center in New Haven. “The older, less conservative missions often see it the other way around.”

But the new arrivals say they have a legitimate role to play as well. “Right now, with the situation being a disaster, we mostly focus on food and water and supporting the doctors; that’s our mission,” said Pat Harney, a spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology, which has several hundred health professionals and volunteer ministers in Haiti.

Some of them arrived on John Travolta’s Boeing 707, which he flew down loaded with tons of relief supplies, and when not doing relief work they sang classic rock songs at a crowded bar full of aid workers inside the United Nations compound. At the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince, where Scientologists in bright yellow T-shirts have assisted as volunteers, some have carried out what they call touch therapy, in which they say they realign patients’ nervous systems by touching them through their clothes.

The hospital director, Dr. Alix Lassegne, said he told the group’s doctors to stick to traditional medicine and other volunteers to stay away from trying to convert anyone.

“We had fractures, serious wounds, and there was no time for unconventional things,” Dr. Lassegne said. “I told them, as director of the hospital, in no way would I permit other activities.”

Missionaries have long filled a vacuum left by an impoverished and historically unstable government.

While government officials have condemned the 10 Americans, most of them Baptists, who were arrested trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border without proper documentation, they have praised religious groups in general for their work.

“Missionaries have always participated in the process of alleviating pain in this country,” said Patrick Delatour, a top government official.

Christian missionaries run more than 2,000 primary schools in Haiti attended by about 600,000 students, roughly a third of the country’s school-age population, according to the Haitian Education Ministry.

In the case of the Adventists in Carrefour, more than 2,000 children attend a cluster of Adventist schools — primary through university level — that sit on a sprawling campus of palm trees and tidy white buildings perched on a hilltop.

“Even before the earthquake, this was a city of its own,” said Michel Toutian, a resident, 36, as he entered a huge tent city set up by the Adventists. “And the Adventists are the mayor, police, everything.”

Todd Johnson, director of the Center for the Study of World Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, said there were about 1,700 missionaries permanently based in Haiti. The number of missionaries making short-term visits is more difficult to estimate, but some organizations say it is as high as 10,000.

“The outpouring of compassion is heartwarming,” said Sarah Wilson, spokeswoman for Christian Aid, a British organization that receives much of its financing from church members and has a longstanding operation in Haiti. But she added: “People shouldn’t come down here for an experience. They should stay home and write a check.”
1393 2010-02-16 Windows Phone has a cleaner look than most of today’s smartphone software, with just a handful of large, colorful icons atop a black background. Icons used to start tasks like e-mail or the calling functions are labeled with text, while bigger icons are used for services like photos and . Microsoft executives described the icons as “live tiles” that will update with relevant information, be it a new calendar appointment or a status update from a friend on .

The software borrows heavily from the interface on Microsoft’s Zune music player, and all of the new Windows Phone products will have built-in music functions. Microsoft has tied its Xbox Live gaming service into the phone software as well.

Company executives also highlighted “hubs,” which are something like multilayered folders on the phone. A photo hub, for example, would contain albums of images downloaded to the phone from a camera as well as images pulled from social networking sites.

In a counterintuitive moment, Microsoft’s executives called the software a departure from traditional PC software, saying past fixations on Windows traditions had stifled the company. Still, the mobile software links into Microsoft’s business products like Office and corporate e-mail, something the company pitches as a major advantage over other phones that tend to lean more toward the consumer.

Mr. Ballmer said that all of the major carriers would offer products based on Windows Phone 7, while hardware makers including , , Samsung and HTC had committed to the software. Microsoft expects its hardware and network partners to create products with unique looks by modifying the hubs and other areas and to ship phones close to the end of this year.

The revamped software represents a rarity for Microsoft — it scrapped previous versions of its software to build something from scratch. Microsoft spent the last 18 months trying to add gloss and sophistication to a product that had been ridiculed as clunky and too wedded to the company’s PC roots.

“We think there is a really big opportunity for a fresh start,” said Todd Peters, the vice president at Microsoft in charge of mobile product marketing. “Consumers have an amazing capacity for retrying things.”

Intel and Nokia, too, have opted for a fresh start. The companies have decided to create a software platform called MeeGo that they hope will make its way into cars, home phones, smartphones and computers.

At its core, MeeGo is a broad attempt to outflank mobile phone software from Google, Apple and Microsoft by creating a product that can bring a similar interface to a wider range of computing devices.

“The next evolution of mobile computing, which is way beyond smartphones, tablets and netbooks, will require a truly open platform,” said Kai Oistamo, Nokia’s head of devices.

Historically, Microsoft and Intel have dominated the computing industry hand-in-hand, with Microsoft producing the most-used software and Intel building the most popular chips. But this Wintel duopoly, as it is sometimes called, has not carried over to the mobile world.

Instead, with its share of the market for cellphone operating systems declining, Microsoft finds itself struggling to be the innovator rather than an also-ran mimicking Apple and Google.

Intel has been forced into the software game to ensure that enough good applications exist for its Atom chips, which are in laptops today but have yet to make their way into mobile phones.

Nokia emerged as a natural partner for Intel given the company’s recent struggles in the smartphone arena.

While it leads in overall smartphone market share, Nokia has watched as interest skyrocketed in Apple’s and phones based on Google’s Android software. The iPhone, in particular, also opened the market for mobile applications through Apple’s App Store, which has served more than three billion downloads.

Intel and Nokia look to attract software developers to MeeGo, and Intel has even backed the idea of running MeeGo on rival chips if it helps the software gain broader interest.

Analysts contend that the mobile market remains in a state of flux, leaving plenty of room for these companies to build momentum if they can create something that catches the attention of consumers.

Microsoft has intended to do just that by reorganizing its mobile division and presenting people a phone interface unlike anything else on the market.

More than two years ago, Microsoft started plucking top executives from companies in a variety of industries, hoping they could revitalize its mobile software group. Mr. Peters brought some marketing muscle from Staples, where he helped to create the popular “Easy Button” campaign.

Other executives arrived from and , as Microsoft sought to find a new way of talking to consumers, since about 86 percent of phones running Windows are sold through retail outlets.

While studies show that consumers tend to react favorably to the Windows brand, they’ve been less enamored of how Microsoft’s phone software works.

“We need to have a degree of humility as we go about our business,” Mr. Peters said. “It has been painful, but it’s getting better.”

Microsoft has also transferred some of its top engineers to the phone group from other divisions, hoping they could provide inspiration and structure to the processes needed to make a polished product on time.

With months to go before phones based on the new software go on sale, Microsoft has provided its rivals with a valuable peek at its plans. Still, Mr. Ballmer pledged that Microsoft’s engineers would continue tweaking the software and that they would soon have more surprises about how developers could build applications for this latest version of Windows.

1416 2010-02-17 By Any Means Necessary, an affirmative action group, is renewing efforts to overturn the state law that prohibits public universities from considering race in admissions. The group filed a class-action lawsuit on Tuesday in federal court in Oakland, challenging the constitutionality of a ballot measure approved by California voters in 1996. Both a federal appeals court and the California Supreme Court have rebuffed earlier challenges to the law, Proposition 209. The complaint says two United States Supreme Court rulings in affirmative action cases since those earlier decisions warrant another effort to invalidate the part of Proposition 209 that deals with university admissions.
1417 2010-02-17 In 2004, three years before the New Jersey Legislature abolished capital punishment, she ruled that the state’s procedures for carrying out the death penalty were insufficient to guarantee the rights of the condemned and that they had to be re-examined before the state could perform another execution by lethal injection.

“It is one thing for proponents and opponents to talk about capital punishment as an abstract proposition,” Judge Pressler wrote. “It is quite another to see it carried out.”

But she was best known for her decision in the Little League case, which she made before she was elevated to the bench. This was in 1973, when discrimination cases in New Jersey were heard by the Division of Civil Rights before government-appointed examiners, of which Sylvia Pressler, then a lawyer, was one.

The previous year, a 12-year-old girl, Maria Pepe, had played three games for a Hoboken Little League team before national Little League officials learned of her participation and threatened to revoke the local league’s charter if she continued to play. The National Organization for Women brought suit on behalf of the girl and all others in New Jersey. Ms. Pressler’s ruling in favor of them was upheld by the New Jersey Appellate Court, and in 1974 Little League Baseball agreed to allow girls to play on its teams and to start a softball division especially for girls.

“The institution of Little League is as American as the hot dog and apple pie,” she wrote in her ruling. “There is no reason why that part of Americana should be withheld from girls.”

Sylvia Diane Brodsky was born in New York City — either in Upper Manhattan or the Bronx, her husband said — on April 10, 1934, and grew up in the Bronx. (Professionally, she used the initial of her maiden name as a middle initial.) Her parents were Jewish immigrants, her mother from what is now Belarus and her father, who came to New York via Argentina, from what is now Poland. For a time he was an owner of a parking garage; he died when his daughter was a young girl.

Judge Pressler graduated from Hunter College High School in Manhattan and then attended Queens College before transferring to Boston University, where her future husband was in school, and where she received a bachelor’s degree. Her law degree was from Rutgers School of Law — Newark. Before becoming a hearings examiner, she worked in private practice and was the Englewood city attorney.

She was named to the bench in Bergen County Court in 1973 by Gov. William T. Cahill; Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed her to the state’s Superior Court in 1976, and she was assigned to the Appellate Division the following year. In 1997 she was named presiding judge for the administration of the Appellate Division. She retired in 2004.

Judge Pressler was at the center of a controversy in 1983, when a state senator, Gerald Cardinale, invoked the privilege known as senatorial courtesy to block her reappointment to the Superior Court. Mr. Cardinale claimed that she lacked a judicial temperament, but the Senate overwhelmingly approved her reappointment anyway, after it was disclosed that Mr. Cardinale had appeared before Judge Pressler as an unsuccessful litigant.

In addition to her husband, whom she met in 1953 when both were working as waiters at a Jersey Shore hotel, she is survived by a daughter, Jessica Pressler of Tenafly, N.J.; a son, Noah, of Englewood; and three grandchildren.

“She was not a good waitress,” her husband said in an interview on Tuesday. “She was very good at other things — almost everything else.”
1418 2010-02-17 Re “From Right of Radio Dial, a Challenge to McCain” (front page, Feb. 9):

1419 2010-02-17 Later, Mike Richards and Ryan Getzlaf scored against Grotnes before he was taken out with 15 minutes left because of a leg cramp, having stopped 28 of 32 shots. The last four goals came against the fill-in Andre Lysenstoen.

Canada Coach Mike Babcock said the game went “a lot like what we expected.” He praised the Norwegians for playing with “good energy,” particularly forwards Patrick Thoresen and Mats Zuccarello Aasen, who play in the Russian K.H.L. and Swedish Elitserien.

Roberto Luongo turned aside all 15 shots he faced for Canada. Luongo, the Vancouver Canucks’ goalie, was saluted by hometown fans for every save with bellowing shouts of “Luuuuuu.”

Those included some difficult saves. In the third period, Luongo had to be ready for a point-blank shot by Tore Vikingstad on a power play and was lucky when Thoresen lifted the rebound over the crossbar.

Nevertheless, while the Norwegians played bravely for much of the game they were no match for Canada, a tournament favorite alongside Russia.

Babcock was able to send out line after line of all-star-caliber players. Joe Thornton centered his San Jose teammates Heatley and Patrick Marleau. Corey Perry, Getzlaf and Eric Staal skated together.

Crosby started the game centering Rick Nash and Patrice Bergeron, but later Iginla took Bergeron’s place to add what Babcock called a “physical presence.” Bergeron took Iginla’s place alongside Richards and Jonathan Toews.

The defense pairings were Scott Niedermayer and Shea Weber; Chris Pronger and Dan Boyle; Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook; with Drew Doughty rotating into the mix.

The game was played before a crowd ready to party, in a nation that did not really believe the Olympics had begun until the Canadian men’s team had taken its first face-off. The fans cheered every goal with equal fervor.

The Canadians finished with 42 shots, with five players contributing four shots each. Boyle’s plus-4 was the best plus-minus mark, and his 20 minutes 12 seconds of ice time led the team.

Babcock rolled his lines evenly and frequently. Marleau led the forwards with 16:51 on the ice. Crosby skated for 15:30, an unusually low figure for him, but then again he is not nearly as dominant a figure on Team Canada as he is on the Pittsburgh Penguins.

“These guys are used to 21 minutes and here they’re getting 13 or 14, and what happens then is the shifts start to get long,” Babcock said about the need to properly manage his players’ ice time. “As a group we have to understand there’s not enough minutes for everyone.”

The Canadians’ next game is against Switzerland on Thursday. Norway will face the United States on Thursday.
1420 2010-02-17 It is not often that prosecutors ask that a Ferrari be included in a bail package. Then again, the criminal case of Steven Mandala is nothing if not unusual.

Mr. Mandala, 29, is accused of lying about his qualifications to get a job with Merrill Lynch in April 2009. He greatly inflated how much money he brought in for the brokerage firm he had worked for, providing forged pay stubs and tax returns to back up his lies, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement Tuesday.

On the basis of those lies, Merrill Lynch hired Mr. Mandala and gave him a $780,000 loan, a perk customarily extended to lure top-flight traders and brokers, Mr. Vance said.

Mr. Mandala promptly used the loan to buy a $245,000 Ferrari, a purchase that bothered prosecutors so much that they made the unusual move of asking a judge to force him to turn over the car as part of his bail.

The judge, Daniel P. FitzGerald of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, ended up setting bail at $500,000, Ferrari not included.
1421 2010-02-17 NORTHFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Kraft Foods said Tuesday its fourth-quarter profit more than tripled on strength in developing markets and continued benefits from its overhaul plan to focus on its most profitable products.

Kraft, which is buying the British candy maker Cadbury, said that it expected long-term earnings growth at the high end of its previous forecast of 7 to 9 percent. Kraft, whose brands include Maxwell House, Oreo cookies and Kraft cheese, said profit surged to $710 million, or 48 cents a share, from $178 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.

Sales rose 3 percent, to $11.03 billion from $10.68 billion largely as a result of currency exchange effects, Kraft said.

Shares in the company, which is based in Northfield, fell 12 cents, or 0.41 percent, to close at $28.97 on Tuesday.

Kraft said revenue in the United States continued to fall in the quarter, as consumers bought less expensive store brands, forcing Kraft and other name brands to cut prices. Lower prices drove revenue down 1.2 percentage points in the quarter, Kraft said.
1422 2010-02-17 Last Wednesday, the Dallas Fed president, Richard W. Fisher, said that interest rates on Treasury securities had been kept unnaturally low by the willingness of the Chinese to buy American debt and by shaky European economies, like Greece’s.

“We cannot count forever on the largess or the misfortune of others to mask our own imbalances here at home — for fiscal profligacy in Washington today hinders our ability to address fiscal challenges tomorrow,” Mr. Fisher told the World Affairs Council of Dallas-Fort Worth.

The Fed has just two main responsibilities — keeping inflation low and promoting maximum employment — but balancing them is perhaps its greatest challenge. With unemployment at 9.7 percent, few expect the Fed to start raising interest rates for at least several months.

For now, Mr. Bernanke, who was granted a second four-year term last month after a contentious Senate debate, has shown little appetite for applying brakes on the economy, though he has outlined a strategy for the Fed to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet, in part to reassure the markets that he is mindful of the threat of inflation.

Mr. Hoenig was the sole dissenter last month when the Fed’s key policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted to keep short-term interest rates near zero, where they have been since December 2008. Specifically, Mr. Hoenig objected to the panel’s statement that “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” were still warranted.

Mr. Hoenig is known for his wariness of inflation, so his dissent was not entirely a surprise. But other members of the committee, while using more cautious language, appear to share at least some of his concerns.

In a speech last month in Arlington, Va., the Fed’s vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said “the deficit is on track to remain quite large even as the economy recovers, pushing up the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product substantially.”

Mr. Kohn added: “Unless the trajectory is changed, the competition for savings between the government, on the one hand, and households and businesses, on the other, could be significant as households and businesses begin to borrow and spend in the recovery, putting upward pressure on interest rates.”

And James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said in an interview last week that it made sense for the Fed to think about withdrawing from what he called its “unprecedented monetary policy” since 2008: the combination of near-zero interest rates and huge purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities.

The expansion of the balance sheet helped drive down long-term interest rates and support economic recovery. But Mr. Bullard said the idea that “the worst part of the crisis is over, so maybe it’s time to start adjusting” was sensible, adding, “I’m sympathetic to that argument.”

Not all of the Fed’s leaders are preoccupied about the prospect of inflation; some consider it remote and are more focused on the weak job market.

“I do think the news is mostly good on the inflation front, although the need for careful policy choices is even more critical than usual,” Narayana R. Kocherlakota said Tuesday in his first speech as president of the Minneapolis Fed.

Mr. Kocherlakota told the Minnesota Bankers Association, in St. Paul, that the decline in gross domestic product during any recession was not felt evenly across the population.

“Some workers — those who lose their jobs — suffer much bigger falls in income,” he said. “For this reason, many macroeconomists now believe that the true cost of a recession is not the fall in G.D.P. per se, but the associated increase in the risk of people becoming, and staying, unemployed.”

Mr. Kocherlakota noted that employment was slow to recover after the last two recessions, in 1990-91 and in 2001, and that unemployment — still at its highest level since the early 1980s — has leveled off only because fewer employees are getting laid off or quitting.

“To get a true expansion in employment and in the economy, the hiring rate has to pick up — and we have yet to see evidence that it will do so in the immediate future,” he said.
1423 2010-02-17 A New York Times reporter accused of plagiarizing portions of several articles resigned from the newspaper on Tuesday, according to two people briefed on the matter.

The reporter, Zachery Kouwe, who had already been suspended, met late Tuesday afternoon with representatives of The Times, The New York Times Company and the Newspaper Guild of New York. The participants were to discuss possible disciplinary action, including dismissal, but instead Mr. Kouwe resigned.

Participants were told that the meeting had to remain confidential, but the events were described by the two people who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Last Friday, the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, Robert Thomson, sent a letter to editors of The Times saying that portions of an article written on Feb. 5 by Mr. Kouwe were identical or nearly identical to a Journal article published online hours before Mr. Kouwe’s. The Times editors investigated and found other examples.

The Times made the matter public on Monday, when it published an Editors’ Note stating that Mr. Kouwe had copied passages from Wall Street Journal and Reuters articles, and used them “in a number” of his articles and in blog posts, without attribution. It did not say how many times that had occurred.

“The Times has dealt with this, as we said we would in our Editors’ Note, consistent with our standards to protect the integrity of our journalism,” Diane McNulty, a spokeswoman for the company, said Tuesday. “Beyond that, we don’t comment on personnel issues.”
1424 2010-02-17 Merck posted quarterly revenue above analysts’ estimates on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of its diabetes and allergy drugs.

Merck said fourth-quarter net income was $6.5 billion, or $2.35 a share, including about two months of results from Schering-Plough, a merger completed in early November. The results include a big gain tied to the transaction. A year earlier, Merck reported net income of $1.64 billion, or 78 cents a share.

Excluding deal-related and other special items, earnings were 79 cents a share, matching analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.

Revenue was $10.09 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of nearly $9.7 billion.

Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, said the company remained firmly committed to its financial targets from the $41 billion Schering deal. This month, Pfizer, which is digesting its own huge takeover of Wyeth, lowered its 2012 financial forecasts as analysts cited unexpectedly high spending.

Combined sales of the Merck diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet jumped 43 percent in the fourth quarter to $760 million, even as the products began to face competition from a rival drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.

Sales of Merck’s Singulair allergy pill rose 12 percent to $1.3 billion. Combined sales of its cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia, which have faced questions over safety and effectiveness, rose about 6 percent to $1.19 billion, helped by strong growth outside the United States.
1425 2010-02-17 HATTIESBURG, Miss.  Scott Phillips had to close his small plumbing company after the housing bubble burst and his business dried up. Roshonda Bolton lost her job when the garment and uniform factory where she had worked for 16 years shut down last August.

Hunting for work just as the nation’s economy was shedding eight million jobs, they found little besides discouragement.

“I applied for everything, found nothing,” said Ms. Bolton, 37.

That finally changed when the two were hired by a paper-napkin factory here last month, placing them in the vanguard of a new approach that Mississippi and a growing number of states are taking to get people working again. Their salaries will initially be paid by the State of Mississippi, which is tapping into a relatively small pot of welfare money in last year’s stimulus package that can be used to subsidize jobs directly.

Now they are being trained on the machines here at the Hattiesburg Paper Company, learning to turn mammoth rolls of paper into folded dinner napkins and toilet paper. The general manager, Steve Swiggum, said the state’s offer to subsidize the salaries helped push the company to accelerate its hiring.

“We kind of held back a little bit in the midpart of the fall,” he said, “just to wait to really see what the economy was going to do.”

The debate over a new jobs bill in Congress  where the Senate is considering a wavering agreement supported by the Obama administration  largely centers on other approaches, like modest payroll tax breaks for businesses that hire and more spending on infrastructure.

Lately, however, with the unemployment rate stubbornly hovering near 10 percent, some liberal economists have urged the Obama administration to take a more direct tack: they want the government to spend money directly to create jobs, much as it did during the New Deal. Some call it the most cost-effective way for the government to create jobs.

The idea has gained little traction in Washington. But on a small scale, some 21 states are already taking the direct approach, using a sliver of the $5 billion in welfare money in last year’s stimulus act that can be used to pay governments and private employers to hire people.

Florida recently announced that it would use up to $200 million to create thousands of jobs in the public and private sectors. Los Angeles County set itself a goal of putting 10,000 people to work with its money. Tennessee focused its initial efforts on Perry County, a small rural county where the unemployment rate rose above 25 percent after an auto parts plant closed.

After Perry County paid for roughly 400 jobs, as varied as road workers and pie bakers, the unemployment rate dropped to 18 percent. But local officials worry about what will happen when the subsidies end.

Here in Mississippi, state officials have come up with a novel approach that they hope will improve the chances that the jobs they create will outlast the subsidies. Labor experts say the experiment is being watched with interest by other states.

The Steps program, as Mississippi calls it, focuses on private-sector jobs. There are limits as to what kinds of work can qualify  no strippers or bartenders need apply. And the program is set up to reduce the subsidy for each new worker over time: employers will be reimbursed for each new worker’s full salary for the first two months of work, and then the monthly reimbursement will be scaled back gradually until it drops to just a quarter of the salary in the sixth month. After that, the employer must pay the full salary.

The program is basically open to almost all for-profit businesses and nonprofit groups, as well as public hospitals, that are in good standing with the state. To increase small-business participation, officials said they were giving priority to employers with 25 employees or fewer, and barring companies where the work force has gone on strike or been locked out. No more than half of a business’s work force can participate.

For now, stimulus money is paying the salary of Edgar Herring, a 49-year-old who lost his job of 18 years when a local lumber company shut down last fall, at his new job on the housekeeping staff at King’s Daughters Medical Center in Brookhaven.

It is also paying the salary of Roger Thomas, 36, who lost his job as a car salesman, at his new sales job with National Collection Systems, a locally owned waste management company in Jackson.

And it is paying Johnny B. McGowan, 59, Curtis R. Williams, 43, and John McCoy, 46, to install metal studs and Sheetrock in the old Standard Life building in downtown Jackson, an Art Deco tower being converted to apartments.

The challenge with subsidized work programs is to make sure that the government does not wind up paying for jobs that would have been created without public money, said Richard A. Hobbie, the chief executive officer of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, which represents state labor departments.

The last big federal subsidized jobs program, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon, ended during the Reagan administration after critics charged that it was paying local governments for jobs they would have filled in any case.

If the idea of subsidized jobs is seen as liberal in some circles, it seems to have bipartisan appeal at the state level. Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, one of the nation’s most prominent Republicans, said he saw the state’s program as being in the spirit of the welfare overhaul.

“It’s welfare to work,” he said.

The state can spend up to $43 million on the program, which officials estimate could create as many as 3,500 jobs  the equivalent of several factory openings, but only a small dent in the problem for a state that had 133,000 unemployed residents in December. Only a few dozen workers have been hired since the program began last month after receiving federal approval.

Mississippi’s decision to pay for jobs in the private sector means that the public is paying to create jobs that will provide little public benefit. But Mr. Barbour said he believed it to be the best way to improve the economy.

“The real economy that generates jobs generates private-sector jobs, from whence come taxes and quality of life for people,” he said in an interview in his office in Jackson. He added that he believed it would be self-defeating to try to spur economic development by using taxpayer money to create more public-sector jobs. “That’s like a dog chasing its tail, except sooner or later there’s no tail left,” Mr. Barbour said.

Now the problem facing Mississippi and other states is the calendar: the welfare money in the stimulus bill must be in the process of being spent by the end of September. Mr. Barbour said he hoped the program would be extended so more jobs could be created.

For the workers, there is another deadline: six months from now, when the subsidies wind down. But Wanda Lindsey, 39, who was hired to help a Jackson construction firm, Garrett Enterprises, manage projects and bid on new ones, said she expected to more than pay for herself.

“I fully intend to make them a lot more than that in the first six months,” she said.
1426 2010-02-17 Microsoft eventually came to dominate the market for PC operating systems, prompting armies of programmers to write software for Windows machines. But on the desktop, operating systems have become less important in recent years as more computing has moved to the Internet, which is built around open standards.

In the mobile world, the operating system market is fractured, and the mobile Web is not yet developed enough to handle many things people want to do on mobile devices. Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone and its App Store have turned the once-obscure field of mobile applications into a lucrative market, prompting other companies to mimic that model.

Last year, $4.2 billion in mobile applications were sold, almost all of those iPhone applications, according to figures compiled by the research firm Gartner. After splitting the revenue with developers, Apple pocketed an estimated $1 billion in 2009.

With sales of mobile applications expected to rise 62 percent this year, to $6.8 billion, according to Gartner, Apple’s rivals are working to grab a piece of the pie.

Nokia, the leading cellphone maker, said consumers were downloading more than one million applications a day from its Ovi service. Google, Samsung, LG and Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, have all reported strong traffic at their application stores.

Big network operators are also forging alliances to push their own standards for applications. But perhaps the most unlikely entrant in the field is Alcatel-Lucent, the maker of network equipment.

In December, Alcatel-Lucent, based in Paris and New Jersey, began hooking up network operators with software developers and retailers to build mobile applications for multiple networks and operating systems. More than 50 operators have expressed interest in the program, according to the company, and applications are in development.

In Barcelona on Tuesday, Alcatel-Lucent announced that it was expanding its role as an application broker by setting up a development laboratory based on cloud computing that it called a “sandbox in the sky” to speed development of broader applications.

The company also began an exchange to meld existing applications into new ones, drawing in third-party investors to help finance the creative process.

“We’re in this to help everyone in the application ecosystem make money,” said Johnson Agogbua, who is in charge of the application program at Alcatel-Lucent.

Mobile operators are also organizing among themselves, not content to leave the applications game to the phone makers. Last year four operators with a combined one billion customers — China Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Vodafone and SoftBank Mobile of Japan — formed the Joint Innovation Lab, or J.I.L., to develop applications for handsets on their networks. The group has published a specification for a mobile “widget,” a simple type of phone application that displays live updates of limited data, like the current temperature.

LG, Samsung, Research In Motion and Sharp are making phones using the lab’s widget format.

“We believe this will be good ultimately for the consumer because it will give them more choices,” said Peters Suh, the J.I.L. chief executive. “It is also an opportunity for operators to take back the initiative.”

But these alliances, which are proliferating, are also complicating matters.

On Monday, 20 operators, including AT&T, Sprint Nextel, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, América Móvil, NTT Docomo of Japan and Bharti Airtel of India, created the Wholesale Applications Community, another group with the aim of developing common standards. The four operators in J.I.L. also joined, but both efforts will continue to run in parallel, at least for now.

Some question whether close rivals in the United States, like Sprint and AT&T, which pay developers to create applications unique to their networks and phones, will end up using a common standard, which could allow customers to more easily change carriers.

“Most operators are selling the same phones for roughly the same price,” said Thomas Kaehler, the founder of Communology, a mobile application developer in Cologne, Germany. “They seek unique applications for differentiation, but it has fragmented the market.”

Besides joining the new operators’ alliance, Sprint is also participating in Alcatel-Lucent’s cross-platform effort.

Sprint was the first wireless provider in the United States to develop its own set of mobile applications, using a stable of independent software developers. But the demands of sustaining the solo effort became too great.

“We are now no longer a walled garden, but an open marketplace,” said Len Barlik, a Sprint Nextel vice president for product development. “We can’t do it all ourselves.”
1427 2010-02-17 The Fox Business Network hired Charlie Gasparino, the veteran financial reporter, on Tuesday, in an attempt by the struggling unit of the News Corporation to improve its standing.

The well-known and volatile Mr. Gasparino, who played a pivotal role in CNBC’s coverage of the financial crisis in 2008, will be a senior correspondent for Fox Business, appearing on a range of programs, the network said in a statement.

In the competitive world of TV business news, Mr. Gasparino is one of a handful of on-camera correspondents who regularly break market news.

“We are tremendously excited to have Charlie join the Fox Business family. His breaking news reports during the most recent economic crisis have proved invaluable and we look forward to adding his in-depth reporting to the network,” said Kevin Magee, an executive vice president at Fox Business.

Having Mr. Gasparino working the Wall Street beat could garner more attention for Fox Business, which made its debut two and a half years ago but has gained little traction. Ratings for the network remain feeble; it does not subscribe to overnight numbers, so the Nielsen Company would not provide any information about its audience on Tuesday.

Fox Business is available in about 50 million households, while the dominant business network, CNBC, is in more than 90 million households.
1428 2010-02-17 Ryan scored unassisted with 1 minute 1 second left in the first period after cleverly outdueling the Swiss defenseman Thierry Paterlini from his knees for a loose puck along the boards. The puck bounced off a group of players in front and fell to Ryan in the high slot. He snapped a shot over the right shoulder of goalie Jonas Hiller, an Anaheim teammate of Ryan’s, to put the Americans in front.

Backes scored in the second period, also unassisted, on a Bobby Orr-like rink-length dash. Picking up a rebound near his net, Backes accelerated down the left-wing boards and went right around defenseman Yannick Weber, beating Hiller as he cut across the goal mouth.

Weber is not a player in the Swiss National League A, as 17 of his Olympic teammates are. He is a Montreal Canadien, one of three N.H.L. players on the Swiss team. Ralph Krueger, the Swiss coach, said he was pleased with his team’s playing “eye to eye” with the Americans.

The players from the Swiss league were strong, led by forwards Julien Sprunger of Fribourg-Gotteron and Ivo Ruthemann of S.C. Bern.

Another, Roman Wick of Kloten Flyers, pulled Switzerland to 3-1 halfway through the third period when his centering pass was accidentally knocked in by United States goalie Ryan Miller.

“In the first and second period, we were running around a little and maybe ran out of gas,” Wilson said.

The United States, which is the youngest team in the tournament and whichhad only one practice together, on Monday, looked more cohesive as the game went on.

Wilson put together line combinations consisting of Zach Parise, Paul Stastny and Patrick Kane; Ryan Malone, Joe Pavelski and Phil Kessel; and Jamie Langenbrunner, Ryan Kesler and Dustin Brown; along with tandems consisting of Backes and Ryan — whom he called the team’s best combination — and Ryan Callahan and Chris Drury.

“We’re a chemistry experiment, and it’s going to take time,” Wilson said.

CANADA FLEXES MUSCLE Norway goalie Pal Grotnes stood up against wave after wave of attackers but failed to hold back the red tide of Team Canada as the Canadians skated to an 8-0 victory.

Grotnes, who stopped 51 Canadian shots in a 2-1 loss at the 2008 World Championship, stymied the Canadians in the first period with 14 saves. But early in the second, he was beaten by Jarome Iginla’s power-play slap shot and Dany Heatley’s tip-in at even strength. Grotnes made 28 saves before being taken out with 15 minutes left.

U.S. WOMEN ROLL AGAIN Jenny Potter scored three goals for her second straight hat trick and Natalie Darwitz had 5 points as the United States women (2-0) routed Russia (0-2), 13-0. . The Americans, who beat China, 12-1, in their opener, formally earned an expected berth in the playoffs. (AP)
1429 2010-02-17 On Sunday, Company K had been in its fighting positions a couple of hundred yards away from the family’s mud-walled compound when the rocket or rockets struck it. Since then, several versions of what happened have emerged.

Eager to demonstrate the coalition’s commitment to avoid civilian casualties, and to take responsibility for them when they do happen, the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, immediately issued a statement saying that 12 civilians had been accidentally killed, that the rocket launcher had missed its target by 300 meters and would be suspended from service, and that apologies had been conveyed to President Hamid Karzai. An investigation was ordered.

The investigation found that the targeting system — the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System — had not been defective, a spokesman for the NATO-led coalition force, Lt. Col. Todd Vician of the United States Air Force, said Tuesday. He said the suspension was lifted, allowing the system to be returned to use as a defensive weapon. As to what did happen, however, he said, “We are still waiting for those results and hope to have an answer soon.”

To the Marines of Company K, and an embedded reporter accompanying them, one thing seemed clear: the company had not ordered a rocket strike on that house. At the time they were taking fire from many houses in the area.

“The original target of the two rockets was a compound where insurgents were delivering accurate, direct fire on an Afghan-ISAF joint team,” according to a Sunday news release by the NATO-led force, the International Security Assistance Force.

That team was Company K, with an Afghan Army unit attached to it. “The compound that was hit was not the one we were targeting,” the company commander said that day.

After the Marines saw children stream out of the ruined house, the company commander immediately ordered a cease-fire. With Taliban snipers still trying to pick them off, his men raced across the flat, open expanse between their positions and the house, where medics rendered what first aid they could.

They initially counted 11 dead, because one woman was still alive. Marine Corps medics worked to stabilize her condition, although she had lost three limbs. A helicopter came in to evacuate the wounded, but took so much Taliban ground fire that it had to lift off again before the wounded could be loaded on board. The woman died, making the death toll 12.

There may be a 13th, because one of the men in the family is still missing, and the Marines said Tuesday that his body might be under the mass of rubble. “You hope the individual was not in the building,” said Capt. Christopher M. Hoover, the battalion’s judge advocate. “It’s uncertain right now.”

While the American military methodically worked to figure out what happened, by the next day the Afghan authorities had announced their findings.

At a news conference on Monday, the Afghan interior minister, Muhammad Hanif Atmar, flanked by the Afghan minister of defense and the army commander for Helmand, said that only 9 of the 12 dead in the house were civilians, and that the other 3 were Taliban insurgents who had forced their way into the house and used it as a fighting position.

He said local tribal leaders were “deeply saddened,” but not angry. “I will quote one of them,” Mr. Atmar said, “ ‘We are very sad about the civilian casualties but if nine civilians have died, hundreds of thousands will get freedom.’ ” Marja has 80,000 residents.

The Afghan government’s account seemed at best debatable on Tuesday. For one thing, if there had been weapons in the house, the Marines would most likely have found them.

At this point, though, the Americans are not jumping to any conclusions.

Colonel Vician, the military spokesman, said that the tempo of the fighting had slowed in Marja by Tuesday, although two more ISAF service members, neither American, were killed on Tuesday, one by a homemade bomb, the other by small arms fire.

“There are pockets of resistance that continue to engage combined forces, but it’s sporadic, at times intensive, but sporadic,” he said.

In the mud-brick charnel house where the Afghans were killed, Hajji Karim, the local elder, took up Colonel Christmas’s offer of assistance on Tuesday.

The victims had already been dead for more than two days. Muslims believe in prompt burial, but the family had no way to carry the bodies through the battlefield to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, 17 miles away. Would the Americans take them?

Within hours, a Marine Corps Osprey, a transport aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter, put down nearby, taking enemy fire as it came in, and the Marines grimly loaded the bodies aboard for the trip to the cemetery.
1430 2010-02-17 JIDDA, Saudi Arabia — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke to young women at a Saudi women’s college here on Tuesday, the site of a spirited exchange five years ago with a female official of the Bush administration over the rights of women in Saudi Arabia.

But despite Mrs. Clinton’s invitation to raise the issue, none of the women in the audience asked her about it. The discussion, while lively, focused on the same foreign-policy and security themes that have dominated her visit to the Persian Gulf, notably Iran and the Middle East peace process.

Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to hear the views of the students on women’s rights, noting that “American media presents a very unidimensional portrayal of Saudi women,” focusing on the black veils most wear.

She called for women to get better access to education and to play a bigger role in society. But she avoided criticism of Saudi Arabia, instead praising King Abdullah for his support of coeducational and women’s-only institutions, like the one that played host to her visit, Dar al-Hekman College.

None of the students picked up on Mrs. Clinton’s observation about how the American media portrays Saudi women, which had been a point of contention when Karen Hughes, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy in Bush administration, visited this college in 2005.
1431 2010-02-17 JIDDA, Saudi Arabia  The confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program appeared to deepen Tuesday as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton escalated her verbal assault during a Persian Gulf visit and Russia joined the United States and France in bluntly questioning Iran’s ultimate intentions in enriching uranium.

Speaking in Jidda as she prepared to end a three-day regional visit, Mrs. Clinton said that it would create “quite dangerous” problems if Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, potentially setting off a nuclear arms race.

Mrs. Clinton offered a list of Iranian actions that, she said, contradicted its protestations of peaceful intent, including the disclosure last year of a hitherto secret nuclear facility near Qum.

“You have to ask yourself: why are they doing this?” Mrs. Clinton said. Referring to Iran’s insistence that it is not seeking nuclear weapons, she said, “The evidence doesn’t support that.”

Only last week, Iran said it had begun enriching uranium to a higher level, ostensibly to feed a medical reactor in Tehran.

At a news conference in Tehran on Tuesday, reports said, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reiterated that Iran was ready to suspend enrichment if it could exchange its low-enriched uranium stockpile for processed fuel rods from abroad. But he said the swap should be “simultaneous”  a demand already dismissed by the United States and its allies.

“We are still ready for an exchange, even with America,” Mr. Ahmadinejad said, according to Reuters.

Mrs. Clinton’s comments seemed to amplify the verbal sparring that began Monday when she said Iran was drifting toward a military dictatorship with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps gathering ever greater political, military and economic power.

By way of a response, the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said Tuesday that America itself answered to the description of a military dictatorship.

And as the exchanges intensified on Tuesday, Russia also entered the debate about Washington’s campaign to secure stricter sanction against Iran, saying penalties could not be ruled out if Iran did not persuade world powers that its intentions were peaceful.

Russia also joined the United States and France in signing a letter to the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, asserting that Iran’s uranium enrichment and its failure to notify the I.A.E.A. beforehand were “wholly unjustified, contrary to U.N. Security Council resolutions, and represent a further step toward a capability to produce highly enriched uranium.”

The letter, dated Feb. 12 and obtained from diplomatic sources in Washington, said that if “Iran goes forward with this escalation, it would raise new concerns about Iran’s nuclear intentions.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, visiting Moscow, on Monday urged Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to support stiffer sanctions against Iran, but Mr. Medvedev withheld public support.

On Tuesday, Natalya Timakova, Mr. Medvedev’s spokeswoman, said Russia’s position had not changed and the Kremlin believed Iran should have “broader and more active cooperation” with world powers on its nuclear program.

“The international community needs to be certain that Iran’s nuclear program is peaceful,” she said, “but no one can rule out the use of sanctions if these obligations are not fulfilled.”

Iran has reacted sharply to the latest American criticism.

Mr. Mottaki “raised questions about the United States military dictatorship in the region,” the English-language broadcaster Press TV said on Tuesday, and accused Washington of practicing “modern deceit,” using “fake words” to disguise its intentions in the Persian Gulf area.

“We are regretful that the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tries to conceal facts about the stance of the U.S. administration through fake words,” Press TV quoted him as saying.

Mr. Mottaki was speaking at a news conference alongside his visiting Turkish counterpart, Ahmet Davutoglu.

He also accused Washington of interfering in the internal affairs of other states by undermining their “scientific and technological achievements,” an apparent reference to Iran’s nuclear program which Iran says is for peaceful purposes permitted under international law.

“Those who have been the very symbol of military dictatorships over the past decades, since the Vietnam war until now, see everyone else in the same way,” The Associated Press quoted Mr. Mottaki as saying. Mrs. Clinton’s current visit to the region, he said, was “overflowing with contradictions and incorrect actions.”

On Monday, Mrs. Clinton encouraged Iran’s religious and political leaders to rise up against the Revolutionary Guards, coming as close as any senior administration official has to inviting political upheaval in the country. She chose to issue the call in Doha, Qatar, just across the waters of the Persian Gulf from Iran itself.

“We see that the government of Iran, the supreme leader, the president, the Parliament is being supplanted and that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Her visit was seen as part of the Obama administration’s attempt to shore up support for more stringent sanctions directed at the Revolutionary Guard Corps. But Mr. Mottaki urged Russia and China not to follow Washington’s lead, The A.P. said.

While China has offered steady resistance to the idea of stricter sanctions against Iran, which supplies oil to Beijing, Russia’s stance has seemed slightly more ambivalent. Russia has appeared in recent weeks to be edging closer to supporting stricter sanctions, but still seems to have reservations. Unlike other permanent members of the Security Council, Russia has a regional relationship with Iran that it does not want to inflame.

1456 2010-02-18 Maybe e-book prices won’t be rising so much after all.

Since Apple announced plans to sell digital books on its forthcoming iPad, it has been cast as something of a savior of the publishing industry for allowing e-book prices to go above the $9.99 that Amazon charges for e-books on its Kindle device, a price that publishers say is too low to sustain their business.

But as more details come to light of the actual negotiations between Apple and publishers, it appears that Apple left room to sell some of the most popular books at a discount.

When Steven P. Jobs showed off the iPad last month, he announced agreements with five of the six largest publishers to offer their content through a new iBooks application. Those publishers — the Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan, the Penguin Group and Simon & Schuster — agreed to terms under which they would set e-book prices and Apple would serve as an agent to sell the books to consumers. Apple would take 30 percent of each sale, leaving 70 percent for publishers to split with authors.

Publishers indicated that e-book editions of most newly released adult general fiction and nonfiction would sell in a range from $12.99 to $14.99, under a complicated formula that pegs e-book prices to the list prices of comparable print editions. Publishers liked Apple’s deal because it resulted in a marked increase above Amazon’s $9.99 price for most new releases.

But according to at least three people with knowledge of the discussions, who spoke anonymously because of the confidentiality of the talks, Apple inserted provisions requiring publishers to discount e-book prices on best sellers — so that $12.99-to-$14.99 range was merely a ceiling; prices for some titles could be lower, even as low as Amazon’s $9.99. Essentially, Apple wants the flexibility to offer lower prices for the hottest books, those on one of the New York Times best-seller lists, which are heavily discounted in bookstores and on rival retail sites. So, for example, a book that started at $14.99 would drop to $12.99 or less once it hit the best-seller lists.

Moreover, for books where publishers offer comparable hardcover editions at a price below the typical $26, Apple wanted e-book prices to reflect the cheaper hardcover prices. These books might be priced much lower than $12.99, even if they did not hit the best-seller list.
1457 2010-02-18 A New York judge refused on Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit that claims MBIA took illegal steps to cut the chances that it would have to pay off on bond insurance policies.

The suit, brought by the Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, UBS and 15 more of the world’s largest financial companies, challenges MBIA’s move a year ago to split its insurance business into two companies after it sustained record losses in the mortgage market and lost its top credit rating.

MBIA created the National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, which assumed $5.4 billion of the MBIA Insurance Corporation’s assets and its public finance obligations. MBIA’s structured finance guarantees, including those related to mortgage securities, remained the obligation of the MBIA Insurance Corporation.

The split, which was approved by the New York State insurance superintendent at that time, Eric Dinallo, was intended to allow MBIA to get back in the business of insuring municipal bonds, the company said.

Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for MBIA, said the company would appeal the decision, which was made by Justice James Yates of New York State Supreme Court.

In May 2009, 18 financial institutions filed suit to overturn the split, arguing that MBIA had inappropriately stripped assets from the MBIA Insurance Corporation, making it insolvent.
1458 2010-02-18 A state court judge has refused to dismiss civil fraud charges filed by the New York attorney general against a hedge fund manager whose clients, including Yeshiva University and New York University, lost more than $1 billion in Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme.

The attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, accused J. Ezra Merkin, a prominent Wall Street figure and former chairman of GMAC Financial Services, of deceptive, negligent and reckless conduct in his financial relationship with Mr. Madoff, who pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison term.

While holding himself out as his funds’ investment manager and collecting more than $470 million in management fees, Mr. Merkin had in fact simply handed his clients’ money over to Mr. Madoff without adequate investigation or supervision, Mr. Cuomo contended in the complaint, which referred to Mr. Merkin as “just a glorified mailbox.”

Lawyers for Mr. Merkin had asked Judge Richard B. Lowe III to dismiss the complaint, arguing that it did not meet the standards required under the Martin Act, the state’s antifraud statute, and failed to make valid legal claims under other provisions of New York law, including statutes protecting nonprofit organizations and establishing fiduciary duties.

In the ruling, dated Feb. 8 but made public on Wednesday, Judge Lowe denied all of Mr. Merkin’s arguments for dismissal, noting that the court was obliged at this stage of the case to presume the accuracy of Mr. Cuomo’s accusations.

He noted that defense lawyers had submitted e-mail messages from “about 10 investors” who apparently were aware that Mr. Merkin was forwarding his clients’ money to Mr. Madoff. That is in contrast to Mr. Cuomo’s assertion that Mr. Merkin had concealed Mr. Madoff’s role, and those e-mail messages “fail to demonstrate that dismissal is warranted at this early state of this action,” Judge Lowe said.

Andrew J. Levander, a lawyer for Mr. Merkin, said the ruling was “only a decision on the adequacy of the attorney general’s allegations. It does not address the facts of this case.”
1459 2010-02-18 In what appeared to be the first burst of activism in months not related to the disputed presidential election, about 1,200 Iranians signed a statement against a bill that would further curb women’s rights, the feminist Web site Change for Gender Equality reported.

The statement, issued Wednesday, calls for other groups to protest the bill, which would give men the right to take additional wives without having to tell the current wives under certain conditions and would impose restrictions on alimony for women. The bill was approved last month by Parliament’s legal committee.

In Iran, men can have several wives, but they are generally supposed to get permission from their current ones.

“We issued the statement because we are worried that various groups, including women, can lose civil rights under tense political times like now,” said Asieh Amini, a lawyer and women’s rights advocate living in Oslo. “We have no doubt that democracy will not be implemented without taking women’s rights into consideration.”

Women have played a major role in the protests since the election in June, which the opposition claims the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stole. Many women have been jailed and at least several were killed in the government crackdown on street protests that followed the vote.
1460 2010-02-18 Legislation passed by the House in December to reshape the regulatory system gave the Fed more input on systemic risk than the Senate concept would.

Officials said that Mr. Bernanke, who survived a contentious Senate reconfirmation process last month, was focused instead on preserving the Fed’s supervision of the largest bank holding companies, which include , and , as well as houses like and , which converted to holding companies during the crisis.

“The idea of having a council, with the secretary of the Treasury as chair, and the Fed chairman or his designee as vice chair, is that you’re getting an early-warning system,” said the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, , Democrat of .

The idea of the council is similar to a concept the White House proposed last summer. But a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to interfere with the Senate negotiations, expressed concern about reducing the Fed’s powers any further.

“We think it’s really critical that the Fed, as a lender of last resort in the economy, have hands-on supervision of the largest firms in our economy,” the official said.

Mr. Dodd, who had proposed to strip away those powers as part of a regulatory consolidation, said the Fed’s authority to oversee bank holding companies remained “an open-ended question.”

Senator Bob Corker, Republican of , said in an interview that the extent of the systemic risk council’s powers — not the council itself — required resolution. “There’s a lot of concern about having a regulator that roves around, picking up companies unaware they were going to be regulated by a new entity,” he said.

Senator , a Democrat who supports the idea of the Treasury-led council, said: “You need a vigorous, focused group. You don’t need to create some massive new bureaucracy, but a place to share information and do some level of analysis.”

Mr. Bernanke said at a hearing in October that he supported a Treasury-led council. In a speech last month, he said the Fed was “working not only to improve our ability to identify and correct problems in financial institutions, but also to move from an institution-by-institution supervisory approach to one that is attentive to the stability of the financial system as a whole.”

Others in the Fed, including , president of the , have argued that the central bank is uniquely positioned to be an overall risk regulator because of its role as the lender of last resort and as the nerve center of capital markets and payments systems.

In a speech on Tuesday, Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Fed, said: “Stripping the Federal Reserve of its role in supervision is a step in the wrong direction. Making it the systemic risk regulator is a step in the right direction.”

If anything, the Senate is moving in the other direction, not only to give oversight of systemic risk primarily to the Treasury but also to rein in the central bank’s regulatory powers.

“Let the other traditional regulators focus on direct banking regulation and have the Fed focus more exclusively on monetary policy,” said one committee member, Senator , Republican of . “It’s not like they have a small or unimportant portfolio.”

Senator , Republican of , disagreed. “I’m in the distinct minority on the committee in that I want the Fed to retain a lot of its powers in regulation,” he said. “I think that’s also Treasury’s position. It’s clearly not Dodd, Shelby or even Corker’s position.”

Mr. Dodd and Mr. Corker, who have been spearheading talks over the regulatory overhaul along with the committee’s ranking Republican, of , left Wednesday on a trip to . While Mr. Dodd said the trip was related to their work on the foreign relations committee, other senators said they hoped the two men would arrive at a consensus by the time they returned Monday.

Even if Mr. Dodd’s committee and the leaders of the two parties in the Senate agree on the systemic risk regulator, there are deep divisions over other components of any legislation, and it is not clear what shape a package might take.

Among them is whether to create a consumer financial protection agency that would regulate credit cards, and other products. The House included creation of the agency, which has ’s support, in its overhaul, but Senate Republicans have balked at the idea.

Also under discussion are two recent White House proposals to rein in the size and scope of banks, but some senators have suggested they are aiming to defer debate on them for now.

Representative , a Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, predicted that the consumer agency would be the chief sticking point as the Senate talks proceed.

“There will be an entity in charge of systemic risk — which no one now has the responsibility to do — and the consequence of identifying systemic risk will be immediate remedial action to put that institution out of its misery,” Mr. Frank said.

But some in the Fed remain skeptical. James Bullard, president of the Fed, said in an interview that Mr. Bernanke had been “too kind” in accepting blame for regulatory failings, given the failings of other regulators, from the to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .

“If he’s giving up, it’s because he’s somehow making some calculations about what the realities are,” Mr. Bullard said.

“But I’m telling you, this business of how we’re going to give this to a committee and we’re going to have an effective response to the next crisis. That is a joke.”
1461 2010-02-18 For months, Mr. Zapatero called the crisis “a slowdown,” a term many Spaniards thought vastly underestimated its scope. Now, critics and defenders alike say the government’s response has been belated, incoherent and erratic, even as markets are paying increasingly close attention.

Elected in the boom year of 2004 promising social change, Mr. Zapatero has watched his credibility sink amid the economic anxiety. Polls have lately shown him trailing the opposition Popular Party, even though it is embroiled in corruption scandals and has not presented a coherent competing economic plan. In Parliament on Wednesday, the leader of the opposition, Mariano Rajoy, reiterated his call on the Socialists to pick a new leader.

In his speech, Mr. Zapatero offered few new details on the austerity plan he announced in January to cut Spain’s deficit in half, to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product by 2013.

Experts agree that Spain is not Greece, and is unlikely to need similar help from the European Union. Its public debt is at 55 percent of gross domestic product, far below the 80 percent average for the European Union. Its banks have never needed a bailout, and its infrastructure is widely considered the best in the Mediterranean.

Spain has nevertheless become the biggest euro-zone economy to stumble, brought low by the collapse of a housing boom that has left 800,000 newly built homes sitting empty. Analysts worry that Spain’s recovery will be delayed or undercut by a rigid labor market and generous unemployment compensation — and a government that has yet to tackle the problem.

Instead, the government is banking on growth. “We went through a period of large change in the cycle, and the economy underwent last year a period of shock. Now, we’re reaching normalization,” José Manuel Campa, a deputy finance minister, said last week in an interview.

Mr. Campa, who is expected to travel soon to New York to speak to investors, said there was “broad consensus” in the government that economic growth was expected to be flat this year, but that it would start to rise “very slowly” next year.

Yet some saw Mr. Campa’s reassurances as at odds with Mr. Zapatero’s approach.

“Mr. Campa goes on a road show one day to reassure European investors that if the Spanish economy has to cut government spending in order to grow, it will,” the columnist Joaquín Estefanía wrote in El País this week.

“The next day,” he continued, Mr. Zapatero announces “that he will extend unemployment benefits to workers who aren’t already enrolled.”

Experts say that waiting for growth is not an effective strategy for fighting the economic downdrafts, and argue that Spain needs a radical structural overhaul of the labor market. To dismiss an employee, to cite one example, Spanish companies must pay 45 days for every year worked. The government and labor unions have begun talks to lower that number to 33.

As a result of that and other rigid labor laws, in the past decade Spain has had one of Europe’s largest rises in pay but one of its lowest increases in productivity. In the past, that gap might have been closed through a currency devaluation. But that avenue is closed for members of the euro zone, so instead Spain faces a grinding process of wage deflation.

In the meantime, the unemployment payments have helped create a class of the comfortably unemployed. In a cafe near the Prado museum on a recent afternoon, José Díaz, 45, said he was fired in December from his job in an electronics store in Gerona, in Catalonia, but was in Madrid on vacation. “I’m taking advantage of the fact that I’m on a break,” Mr. Díaz said.

He said that he had paid off his mortgage, that his wife had a job and that he was only two months into two years of unemployment benefits, which equaled about 25 percent of his salary. “I’m privileged,” he said.

In addition to busting the federal budget, the generous job benefits make businesses wary of taking on full-time employees. Instead, they favor temporary contracts that have become common among younger workers and the newly hired, who absorb the brunt of the crisis. A full 40 percent of Spaniards between the ages of 16 and 25 are unemployed, which many fear is causing long-term damage to the country.

Some argue that as a socialist, Mr. Zapatero is in a better position to tackle reform than are the conservatives. He could say that “the current system is socially divisive” and “mainly penalizes the young, women and immigrants,” said Charles Powell, a history professor at CEU San Pablo University in Madrid.

Instead, analysts say, he is dancing around the issue.

“Nobody is being realistic about this,” said Ms. Allard, the Spanish labor market expert. “No one is saying publicly that this is a system where 70 percent are overprotected, underproductive and overpaid and the rest of them are paying for it.”
1462 2010-02-18 The easiest way to employ the collar options strategy is to buy a mutual fund. The Collar Fund, whose ticker is COLLX, and the Gateway Fund, whose ticker is GATEX, are good candidates. While these funds are certainly not immune to market downturns, they do provide a fairly effective hedge. The Gateway Fund lost about 14 percent in 2008, compared with the almost 18 percent loss of its peers. The broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 37 percent that year.

Michael Chamberlain, a fee-only certified financial planner based in Santa Cruz, Calif., uses the Collar Fund for his most risk-averse clients, who range in age from their 20s to 70s.

“Asset allocation used to be the primary way to limit risk,” Mr. Chamberlain said, “but the Collar Fund seems like a reasonable way to decrease risk while providing exposure to the stock market.”

With the Collar Fund, options are bought and sold on approximately 75 stocks, representing 300 of the largest United States companies. Although it is less than a year old, its managers, Summit Portfolio Advisors, have been managing money using collar strategies in separate accounts for years. The fund charges about 1 percent annually to investors for management fees and has a $2,500 minimum investment.

Having employed options strategies since 1988, the Gateway Fund also focuses on risk-adjusted returns, but with a larger, more diversified stock portfolio. Instead of hedging a few stocks, it uses market indexes to get a bigger slice of the market.

Like many hedge funds, though, Gateway will lag the broader stock market on the upside. It rose about 6.6 percent last year, compared with a 16 percent gain for the S.& P. index. It carries a 5.75 percent sales charge (for A shares), 0.94 percent in annual expenses and a 0.25 percent 12(B)1 fee. The minimum investment is $2,500.

Keep in mind that neither fund can completely suit your specific needs. If you want to tailor a collar strategy to your company stock position or your specific portfolio mix, you can buy and manage options yourself or hire an investment adviser to do it for you.

Collar strategies may not work as a long-term play over decades. They are most useful if you are in or near retirement and you need to hedge a large stock position. If you do not have confidence with options strategies — or do not have a full understanding how they work — the mutual funds offer a way to participate in this protective strategy.

“You need something customized to your needs,” said Zvi Bodie, a financial economist at Boston University and a co-author of “Worry-Free Investing” (Financial Times Management, 2008). “Collar funds are a safe substitute for target-date mutual funds, which don’t protect you at all from the downside risk.”
1463 2010-02-18 The Kentridge show will fill one of the museum’s largest temporary exhibition spaces, off the second-floor atrium, the same space that accommodated Richard Serra’s colossal spiraling sculptures in 2007. As envisioned by Mr. Kentridge and the show’s curators, Klaus Biesenbach, Judith B. Hecker and Cara Starke, it will try to join the two deeply intertwined elements of Mr. Kentridge’s work, his charcoal drawings and the animated projections he makes using them, so that the audiovisual is not cordoned off and relegated to theater rooms with small doors and dense crowding as it often is in museums.

Taking advantage of the galleries’ size and soaring height — 20 feet — the aim has been to encourage viewers to look across long stretches of space lined with drawings, directly into several almost-open rooms where the animations will be playing, projected in some cases at movie-house scale. One danger, of course, is that the drawings could end up feeling marooned in the process.

“I think the shift in scale is a benefit, really, but it’s got to be done the right way,” Ms. Hecker said, walking through the space last week. “The whole idea of the design of the show is based on the long view.”

And that is where Mr. Neuner and his five-member staff — particularly Lana Hum, the exhibition designer assigned to oversee the Kentridge show — come in. They have figured out ways of using sound-dampening and insulation so that the theaters can remain remarkably open while allowing viewers, once inside, to hear only the projections playing within them, and to feel as if they have left the rest of the exhibition behind. But when visitors leave, in some cases, the sounds will follow them, bleeding out to mingle where the drawings hang.

For the drawings, lighting is being used to pull viewers’ eyes back down from the heights of the projections into what the curators and designers hope will feel, in spite of its large size, like a much more intimate gallery space, thanks in part to the use of gray instead of white for the walls. (Mr. Kentridge’s sooty films play better against gray walls than against white ones.)

Mr. Biesenbach, the museum’s chief curator at large, who has worked many times with Mr. Neuner, calls the designer’s role one of “double translation,” in which he first interprets a curator’s sometimes abstract vision of how to present an artist’s work to the public and then translates that vision into sheetrock and spotlights. “The goal is something that comes together in a design as if there was no other way to do it, as if there was no other alternative,” he said, adding that with Mr. Neuner’s help, if often does.

“Jerry has a very, very elegant mind,” Mr. Biesenbach said.

Mr. Neuner, a soft-spoken man with the genial but authoritative manner of a small-town doctor, studied to become an artist, earning an M.F.A. from Columbia University, but then took a job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in its exhibition design department, purely to pay the bills. He later spent several years in an architectural woodworking shop in New York, which he left after five years, “really knowing how to make stuff, with my hands.”

When he came to the Museum of Modern Art, it was in the middle of preparing its landmark 1980 Picasso show, which filled every gallery. But his first real immersion came later that year, with a show of the work of Joseph Cornell organized by Kynaston McShine. Mr. McShine wanted to find a way to avoid isolating Cornell’s delicate, poetic shadow boxes in cases or cabinets, and Mr. Neuner devised a plan for hanging most of them on the walls, as if they were paintings or sculptural reliefs.

Over the years, Mr. Neuner said, the curators he has worked with have run the gamut from near complete inflexibility to near complete freedom.

“It’s very difficult when you’re dealing with the ego of someone who’s not going to give an inch,” he said. “There’s nobody who’s perfect, except maybe Mondrian. Mondrian I would have let get away with that.”

“The curator always has the first and last word relating to everything in his show,” he added. “But having said that, there are times when they know I understand what they need and what the artwork needs well enough that I can look back at a show and say, ‘I did that,’ which is nice.”

When the Kentridge show opens next week, as many as 10,000 people a day could crowd through it, Mr. Neuner estimates, closer to a rock concert than to the kinds of shows that the museum presented in his early days.

“But if it works,” he said, “what will draw all of them through the space is the art, not the architecture. And I will have done my job.”
1464 2010-02-18 One of Abbey Road Studios’ most famous clients hopes that the facility, which has reportedly been put up for sale, can be saved. Paul McCartney, speaking to the BBC’s Newsnight television program on Tuesday, said there have been efforts to save Abbey Road by “a few people who have been associated with the studio for a long time,” although he did not name those people or include himself among them. “I have so many memories there with the Beatles,” he added. “It still is a great studio. So it would be lovely for someone to get a thing together to save it.” The Financial Times, citing anonymous sources, has reported that EMI, the longtime owner of the studio, in North London — home to most Beatles sessions — had put the building on the market. The National Trust, nationaltrust.org.uk, a British preservation charity, said on its Web site, that it would consider buying the complex.
1465 2010-02-18 David C. Vladeck, director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the schemes “take advantage of consumers in times of economic misfortune.”

Since last spring, the commission has brought 11 cases against illicit job placement operators, including the seven announced on Wednesday.

In one of the largest schemes, officials said, Real Wealth Inc., of Lee’s Summit, Mo., sold booklets to more than 100,000 people — many of them elderly and disabled — telling them they could make money from home by mailing postcards and envelopes and seeking government grants. Among other assertions, Real Wealth said customers could “rake in up to $1,500+ per week or more in solid cash” by learning “secrets” about the “$700 billion banking industry bailout.”

Reached by phone, the company’s owner, Lance Murkin, said only, “I’m denying all charges.”

Officials offered these accounts of other schemes that are the subject of the civil complaints:

¶An Arizona company called Government Careers Inc. charged customers $119 for study materials that it said would help them pass exams for jobs with the Postal Service, the Border Patrol and other agencies. The customers were charged though they had been told they would not have to pay until they found a job. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

¶A Florida business called Darling Angel Pin Creations charged $22 to $45 to customers for a starter kit to assemble angel pins, work that was said to generate up to $500 a week. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment, insisted on approving the pins, but it rejected nearly all of the pins submitted, no matter how well made.

¶Also in Florida, Entertainment Work charged customers $80 “memberships” in a Web site that supposedly listed jobs in the film and television industry and the print media. The company failed to disclose that canceling would require paying another fee or going through a burdensome process. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

¶In Texas, Abili-Staff Ltd. billed $30 to $90 for what were described as prescreened work-at-home jobs. A lawyer for the company said that only a minuscule fraction of its customers ever complained and that the company had issued hundreds of refunds to dissatisfied customers.

¶In New Jersey, a company called Independent Marketing Exchange offered stay-at-home mothers jobs as “mystery shoppers” or envelope stuffers. A lawyer said the company’s offerings “were properly presented.”

¶Also in New Jersey, a husband-and-wife team, doing business as Preferred Platinum Services Network, face civil charges as well as criminal mail-fraud charges on claims that they billed consumers for an opportunity to make money by sending postcards offering a fictional product called a mortgage accelerator. The couple, Philip Pestrichello and Rosalie Flores, did not respond to a phone message.

The Justice Department, the Postal Inspection Service and several state attorneys general are helping the commission.

Last August, a federal court in Florida shut down Career Hotline, the company accused of cheating Ms. Willburn, and froze its assets.

The court subsequently issued a default judgment and ordered the company to pay $75,000. Its owner, Susan Bright, was barred from deceiving customers about job listings, but the judgment was suspended because she was unable to pay. Ms. Bright could not be reached for comment.

Ms. Willburn filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau after her experience. She has since found a job at a distribution center in Mansfield, Tex., through the Texas Work Force Commission.

“I don’t want this to happen to other people,” she said. “Everybody is seeking employment, but you just can’t trust anybody. It’s really sad.”

1484 2010-02-19 An Orthodox rabbi who runs a respected Jewish day school in Brooklyn was charged on Thursday with trying to extort $4 million from a Connecticut hedge fund.

The rabbi, Milton Balkany, the dean of the Bais Yaakov day school in Borough Park, is an influential fund-raiser and community leader known for his access to a wide circle of politicians. Mr. Balkany was accused, among other things, of trying to use his influence to extort the fund.

He was charged with wire fraud, extortion, blackmail and making false statements. The wire fraud count alone carries a sentence of up to 20 years.

In a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, prosecutors said that Mr. Balkany, 63, had recently been serving as a “spiritual adviser” to a federal inmate who told him that a Connecticut hedge fund had used inside information to profit from a number of stock trades.

The hedge fund was not named in the complaint, but prosecutors said that Mr. Balkany went to lawyers for the fund and told them that unless they handed over $4 million — $2 million of which would go to Bais Yaakov — he would instruct the inmate to tell the authorities about the insider trades.

According to the complaint, Mr. Balkany told the lawyers that government officials were eager to speak with the inmate — something prosecutors said was a lie. But Mr. Balkany called the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan in January and encouraged officials to speak with the inmate, prosecutors said.

On Thursday, Mr. Balkany received two checks totaling $3.25 million, the complaint said, adding that the rabbi told a hedge fund representative that the inmate would not discuss the fund with the government.
1485 2010-02-19 The New York Police Department says its “stop-and-frisk” program — under which officers investigating crimes, or working to prevent crimes, briefly detain or pat down people on the streets — has played a pivotal role in driving down crime levels to record lows.

But civil rights groups and some criminologists are understandably troubled by new statistics showing that police officers stopped a record 575,000 people last year — nearly 90 percent black or Hispanic — and that the number of stops is growing as crime falls. Instead of dismissing such complaints, the Police Department should re-evaluate the program.

Credible questions about the racial fairness of stop-and-frisk were raised in 1999 in a study released by the state attorney general, then Eliot Spitzer. Conducted by a Columbia University statistician and reviewed by the editor of a reputable journal, it found that the program had disproportionately higher stop rates for blacks and Hispanics. The rates remained elevated even when they were adjusted to take account of higher crime rates and arrest rates in minority neighborhoods.

The Center for Constitutional Rights, which has sued the city, charging it with racial profiling, recently raised similar complaints. In an analysis released last year, it said that police officers used physical force more often against blacks and Hispanics than whites during stops. The group described 2009 as the worst year for the program on record, saying that “heavy-handed policing” in minority neighborhoods was promoting fear of police officers, which makes law enforcement more difficult.

The Police Department says the stops are necessary and that they make up a small fraction of the 23 million contacts that members of the force had with citizens last year. Police officials say minority citizens are more often stopped because many live in high-crime neighborhoods, where officers are often intensively involved in efforts to thwart car thefts, muggings and, especially, shootings. The department points with pride to the fact that the murder rate has reached an all-time low.

But the department’s statistics suggest that the stop-and-frisk tactic may be reaching a point of diminishing returns. In 2009, only 1.3 percent of the nearly 600,000 people stopped were caught with weapons. Just 6 percent were arrested. If the number of stops keeps going up — and officers begin to be seen as acting recklessly and unfairly — the department will risk permanently alienating an entire generation of people in the very neighborhoods where trust in the law is most needed.
1486 2010-02-19 WASHINGTON — President Obama on Thursday officially established a bipartisan commission to propose ways by December to rein in the growing national debt, despite reluctance in both parties to tackling the politically charged issue in a midterm election year.

The Congressional Republican leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, after weeks of criticizing the idea as a door to tax increases, signaled in separate statements that they would participate in forming the commission without setting preconditions. Each will name three lawmakers to the 18-member panel next week, aides said.

Mr. Obama signed an executive order establishing the panel three weeks after the Senate rejected bipartisan legislation to create a similar panel. As he did so, he was flanked at the White House by his choices for co-chairmen, Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican Senate leader from Wyoming, and Erskine B. Bowles, a centrist Democrat from North Carolina who was President Bill Clinton’s White House chief of staff.

“There are some on the left who believe that this issue can be deferred,” Mr. Obama said. “There are some on the right who won’t enter into serious discussions about deficits without preconditions. But those who preach fiscal discipline have to be willing to take the hard steps necessary to achieve it.”

Republicans have complained that Mr. Obama is trying to make it appear in an election year that he is doing something about high annual deficits, which have become a big issue for independent voters especially. Yet whether or not the commission succeeds in sending proposals to Congress after Dec. 1, its deliberations will force both parties to address whether to raise more revenues and make long-range reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security — the tough steps many economists say are essential to controlling a debt growing larger than the economy.

The president’s economic advisers were the main supporters of a commission; his political advisers initially were opposed. So were liberal Democrats in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, largely out of protectiveness over entitlement programs. But Mrs. Pelosi and the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, have agreed to put any commission plan to a vote, though the House would vote only if the Senate first approved a package.
1487 2010-02-19 Last summer, Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, unveiled the city’s Housing Asset Renewal Program, or HARP, setting aside $20 million for developers who agreed to drop the prices of unsold market-rate condos. But the program drew far fewer applications than the city had expected — just five by the Dec. 31 cutoff — so the deadline was extended.

City housing officials and developers said the reasons for the slowdown were clear. Financing for new buildings has dried up. The HARP program has yet to catch on because developers and lenders were unwilling to cut into profits they were expecting to make. Would-be homebuyers remained hesitant to make the leap, and, crucially, mortgages were harder to get.

Developers of higher-priced affordable housing were especially hurt by the housing crash, which caused price differences between their units and market-rate homes to narrow. In addition, market-rate homes do not have the resale restrictions that the affordable homes often have.

Rafael E. Cestero, the city’s housing commissioner, said that during the housing boom, when financing for many projects was lined up, higher-priced units like those at Waters Edge “were deeply affordable” compared with what was then on the market. “We had no idea what was going to happen,” he said.

Denise Scott, managing director for New York’s Local Initiatives Support Corporation, said her agency’s nonprofit partners were struggling to sell 95 refurbished houses and condos in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, Jamaica in Queens, and Morrisania in the Bronx, all city subsidized and costing $250,000 to $350,000. Some have been sitting on the market for 18 months, she said, even though their prices were cut from 15 percent to 30 percent.

Ms. Scott said that demand was down but that the biggest impediment was banks’ unwillingness to issue mortgages.

Samuel G. Gaccione, executive vice president for the TNS Development Group, said his group planned upgrades at the Shelton, a subsidized building under construction in Bedford-Stuyvesant — granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, hardwood floors — to prepare for a bad market and buyer trepidation.

But the fact that some homes are standing vacant in struggling neighborhoods has caused some to question the wisdom of putting them there in the first place. Waters Edge occupies the highest strata of what the city defined as affordable: Three-bedroom units are going for up to $344,000 in a neighborhood where the median income is $45,221, according to census data.

Javier Valdés, deputy director of the community advocacy group Make the Road New York, based in Bushwick, Brooklyn, said the city should change how it calculated affordable income limits. Generally, people eligible for low-income subsidized units can earn up to 80 percent of what is known as the region’s “area median income,” which in 2009 was $76,800. Moderate-income housing is open to people earning from 80 percent to 120 percent, and middle-income housing is open to people earning 120 percent to 175 percent.

But those income figures are based on a broad region that includes Long Island and Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties. Mr. Valdés said affordability should be determined by neighborhood. In Bushwick, the median income is $32,328, according to census figures.

“We understand the difficulty and the balancing act the city has to play, to provide affordable housing to middle and lower income,” Mr. Valdés said. “But if condos are sitting unsold, we do want them given to people who are from the community.”

Mr. Cestero, the housing commissioner, said the city had long worked to create economically diverse neighborhoods and could not have anticipated the housing bust. He said only a few hundred homes remained unsold and noted that the foreclosure rate among city-subsidized homes was just 0.06 percent. “I don’t look back and think our strategy was wrong,” he said. “I think our strategy was exactly right.”

Some projects are doing well, especially lower-priced ones. At the Solara, which Briarwood put up in the South Bronx, 151 of the 160 units are under contract, after a year and a half on the market. Prices there range from $108,815 for a one-bedroom apartment to $202,217 for a three-bedroom.

Seeing this trend, one development switched midstream. The Atlantic Terrace, an 80-unit building in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, built by the Fifth Avenue Committee, a community development group, was originally going to sell 59 units to families earning up to 165 percent of the area median income.

After the market collapsed, the group lined up an additional $2 million in subsidies to make the homes affordable to people earning far less. The lottery for the units drew 4,881 applicants.

“We read the tea leaves,” said Michelle de la Uz, the group’s executive director.

Despite the troubles, the city said that it was nearing the 100,000 mark in the number of affordable units created or preserved and that it was having little difficulty creating and filling rentals, which tend to be aimed at lower-income families and constitute two-thirds of the total.

Given the market, Mr. Cestero said, the city plans to concentrate on preservation and building mixed-income rentals.

In Arverne, Mr. Riso said he was almost certain that the last 22 condos at Waters Edge would sell by summer.

On a recent day, with an Arctic wind whipping off the Atlantic, a rare sight came into view: a new buyer. Ronald Fields, 46, his wife, Naomi, and their 4-year-old son, Taiga, dropped by to see the three-bedroom home they were expecting to close on this month.

Mr. Fields, who works at the cable channel truTV, could not quite believe he was about to become a homeowner, after saving for a down payment for many years.

“Two blocks from the beach, a new development, you can’t beat it!” Mr. Fields said.

And, he added, he was looking forward to that free TV.
1488 2010-02-19 “It will aid the federal stimulus efforts by providing access to the credit markets to fund shovel-ready infrastructure development,” he said of the reorganization, “and it will help taxpayers by lowering the cost of that borrowing.”

MBIA suffered setbacks this month in both state and federal court. The latest came this week, when a state judge in New York refused to dismiss a suit against MBIA filed by a large group of banks that own securities with MBIA guarantees and want to reverse the company’s reorganization. That opinion came a week after a federal judge refused to dismiss a similar suit filed by two hedge funds.

The rulings, unless reversed on appeal, mean that discovery will proceed in the suits, with trials likely later. It is far from easy to answer the simple question of whether MBIA is adequately capitalized, or even if it is solvent.

If you believe current financial market values for the assets MBIA has insured are accurate, then the company will face severe problems in years to come. In an interview this week, the company’s chief financial officer, C. Edward Chaplin, said the company was solvent and said market values were now depressed largely due to illiquidity.

“From a business or economic standpoint, that number is meaningless,” he said.

Before the reorganization, all of MBIA’s policies were backed by the unified MBIA — one whose cherished AAA rating had descended to junk. After the reorganization, the muni bond policies continued to be backed by the full company. But the other policies, including those insuring foreign securities, are now backed by a separate subsidiary that cannot call on a large part of the company’s assets, which support only the munis.

The bond rating agencies think that the backing of the munis now is good enough for an investment grade rating, assuming the other policies are really fenced off. But they think it is questionable whether all those other policies can be honored. Court victories might clear the way for MBIA to start selling insurance again.

Whatever the merits of the cases, MBIA’s legal battles show just how concentrated and convoluted the financial industry has become. Some of the banks suing MBIA are also being sued by it, on claims that they defrauded MBIA by getting it to insure securities backed by mortgage loans that never should have been made.

And MBIA is using some of the same banks to provide opinions that justify it showing smaller losses than it would have to do if it marked some assets all the way down to market value.

The banks also find themselves taking positions that they might not embrace in other contexts. When discussing their own balance sheets, they are more than happy to agree that the prices of some securities are far lower than will ultimately be justified by their cash flows. But they cite those same market values to argue against MBIA.

To prevail, the opponents of MBIA will have to persuade the courts that the reorganization was “one of the world’s largest fraudulent transfers,” as Gandolfo V. DiBlasi, a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell representing the banks, said in one court filing.

These cases are being treated as if state secrets were at stake, even if it is hard to understand why the solvency of a major insurance company, and the way it is regulated by the department, known as the N.Y.I.D., should be an area closed to public scrutiny. But some documents have been filed under seal, with only edited portions released to the public.

“The N.Y.I.D. now admits that it conducted no —— ,” Mr. DiBlasi states in one filing. The next line and a half are blacked out, so we don’t know what it admitted. But the portions that are shown make it clear that the banks think the department conducted a rushed and inadequate review.

The two hedge funds that filed the other suit, Aurelius Capital Management and Fir Tree Partners, at first tried to persuade the insurance department that it had been misled by MBIA. They pointed to rapid increases in loss estimates last year — changes that Mr. Chaplin attributes to a worsening economy — as evidence. “It is simply not believable that MBIA discovered these massive additional loss payments only after the department approved the February 2009 transactions,” they wrote in a letter to the department.

But after the department strongly backed MBIA in the litigation, the funds wrote that “a reasonable observer could easily conclude, as we have” that department officials were helping MBIA “cover up its wrongful conduct.”

The other possibility, of course, is that the department really believes, as it says, that MBIA is solvent and able to pay its claims, even after the reorganization, and that it has done the right thing in trying to revive the muni bond insurance business. If it is right, it will have helped muni bond issuers and investors without really hurting anyone.

But it is hard to escape the suspicion that the department thinks some policyholders — the proverbial widows and orphans who invest in muni bonds — are more deserving of protection than the others, the hedge funds and financial institutions that invested in all those strange concoctions MBIA foolishly insured.

If these cases go to trial, we may get some insights into whether the department’s desire to protect the most worthy investors caused it to fail in its duties to the other policyholders.
1489 2010-02-19 Daimler, the second-largest automaker in Germany after Volkswagen, said there would be no dividend for 2009, after paying 60 cents a share for 2008. It was the first time the company had canceled its annual dividend in 14 years.

“That was a surprise for the market,” said Aleksej Wunrau, an analyst at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. Daimler’s failure to more fully explain why it was not paying a dividend suggested the company might be girding for another tough year, he said.

Otherwise, “everything was very solid,” Mr. Wunrau said.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley lauded Daimler’s focus on preserving its cash rather than rewarding shareholders. The decision to cancel the dividend was “a brave but appropriate move in our view,” the Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to investors.

In a statement, Daimler said that all its divisions would report an operating profit for 2010 of at least 2.3 billion euros. “After playing a calculated defensive game in 2009, we will once again go on the offensive in 2010,” Daimler’s chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said. The company would also resume paying a dividend for 2010, he said.

Mr. Zetsche said that the company was well positioned with new products like its E-Class sedan, introduced last year, and fuel-efficient luxury cars like the hybrid S-Class. In addition, Daimler should be able to hold down costs even as sales increase, he said.

Daimler should benefit from a wage agreement Thursday between the IG Metall union, which represents workers at the company, and employers in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The agreement, which will serve as a benchmark for other regions, will give workers an effective pay raise of 1.5 percent a year through mid-2012, the lowest increase in 30 years, according to calculations by economists at Royal Bank of Scotland in London.

Mr. Zetsche said the pay deal was “certainly in the interests of companies and workers and makes a substantial contribution to job security.”

On Wednesday, Daimler’s supervisory board extended Mr. Zetsche’s own contract until the end of 2013, ending speculation that he might be replaced.

For the full year, Daimler said, the net loss was 2.6 billion euros, compared with a profit of 1.4 billion in 2008. Full-year sales plunged 20 percent, to 78.9 billion euros.

Daimler, based in Stuttgart, is the first of the big German automakers to report fourth-quarter earnings for 2009. BMW’s chief financial officer, Friedrich Eichiner, said last week that the carmaker, based in Munich, would report a profit for the fourth quarter, without giving specific figures.

Daimler struggled more than the other German carmakers during the downturn because, unlike BMW, it has a large truck division which is highly vulnerable to economic cycles. “In commercial truck markets, demand practically evaporated during some months of last year,” Mr. Zetsche said.
1490 2010-02-19 Tracy McGrady is headed to New York, and the Knicks hope even bigger names are coming in July. The Knicks acquired McGrady on Thursday in a swap involving the Houston Rockets and the Sacramento Kings. The Knicks are on the verge of being able to offer two maximum-salary contracts to 2010 free agents, who could include LeBron James. Chicago, Washington and Sacramento cleared enough salary in moves before the deadline to be able to afford one maximum-salary player, and the Los Angeles Clippers got close.

McGrady’s $22.5 million contract expires after this season, and the Knicks could have about $32 million in salary cap space. They sent Jared Jeffries and the rookie Jordan Hill to Houston plus 2011 and 2012 draft considerations. The Rockets will receive guard Kevin Martin and forward Hilton Armstrong from Sacramento. The Kings received Larry Hughes from the Knicks and Carl Landry and Joey Dorsey from Houston and sent guard Sergio Rodriguez to the Knicks.

The Bulls sent forward Tyrus Thomas to Charlotte for a first-round pick and guards Flip Murray and Acie Law, and dealt guard John Salmons to Milwaukee for Hakim Warrick and Joe Alexander.
1491 2010-02-19 Geng He, the wife of Gao Zhisheng, a prominent Chinese dissident who disappeared in February 2009, said late Wednesday that she had not heard from her husband even though Chinese officials told a human rights group recently that Mr. Gao, left, who is presumably being detained by security forces, had been in touch with his wife. Ms. Geng made her comments in a written statement after the Dui Hua Foundation said last weekend that the Chinese Embassy in Washington had told the group that Mr. Gao was working in the Xinjiang region and that he had been in touch with Ms. Geng, who fled to the United States a year ago.
1492 2010-02-19 “I’m afraid we’re causing a little trouble for the establishment,” said Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina conservative who has created a committee that is financing conservative challenges to some Republican incumbents. “You see, I believe in holding incumbent senators accountable to the principles they say they believe in. When Republican senators don’t do the things they say they believe in, voters should have a choice of a new Republican — a real Republican.”

The session offered more tangible evidence, if Democrats needed it, of the emerging energy in the conservative movement. “Hey guys, the conservative movement is alive and well; you can see it here,” said Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential candidate, as he surveyed the huge ballroom with most seats filled.

Dick Cheney, the former vice president, drew a lengthy standing ovation after his daughter Liz introduced him as a surprise guest. But the crowd applauded just as loudly when Marco Rubio — a Tea Party hero, who is challenging Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida for the Republican Senate nomination — offered a 30-minute indictment of Mr. Obama’s policies that summed up Tea Party views on taxes, federalism, Mr. Obama’s health care plan and the handling of terrorists.

“They have used a severe economic recession as an excuse to implement the statist policies they have longed for all this time,” Mr. Rubio said. “They are using this downturn as cover not to fix America, but to try to change America.”

Similarly, Senator Scott Brown, the Republican who pulled off an upset victory in Massachusetts and who in many ways has become a symbol of the Tea Party success, was greeted as nothing short of a conquering hero when he made a surprise visit.

The remark about Mr. Obama’s experimentation with cocaine came from Jason Mattera, author of a forthcoming book called “Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation,” as he likened the CPAC gathering to “our Woodstock.”

“Except that unlike the last gathering, our women are beautiful, we speak in complete sentences and our notion of freedom doesn’t consist of snorting cocaine,” Mr. Mattera said, “which is certainly one thing that separates us from Barack Obama.”

Evidence of the influence of the Tea Party appeared at a panel featuring lessons from Tea Party activists, and another on the 10th Amendment and protecting state sovereignty, which are central causes of the Tea Party groups.

What was billed as a “Real Tea Party” was scheduled for Friday, Day 2 of the conference. There was a discussion on the “rant heard ’round the world,” which is how many Tea Party activists refer to the call by Rick Santelli, a CNBC reporter, a year ago Friday for a new Tea Party, which started the first mass rallies.

But the conservative celebration does not necessarily translate into Republican power. If anything, it may complicate things for Republicans, as Mr. DeMint noted.

FreedomWorks, the advocacy group led by the former House Republican leader Dick Armey that has been an incubator for Tea Party groups, held a news conference to endorse a primary challenger to Senator Robert F. Bennett in Utah, even as Mr. Armey pleaded with the group not to get torn up in power struggles.

“Please don’t let us get into a contest to see who’s top dog,” Mr. Armey said. “We don’t need a top dog, we’re all pulling together. Please let’s stay focused.”

Still, while he urged people to “stay civil among each other,” Mr. Armey also reminded conservatives not to let themselves be silenced. “Be assertive and let them know we mean business.”

And some of those at the conference advocate positions that might be problematic for more mainstream Republicans.

At one point, Mr. DeMint attacked the federal income tax, noting that the Constitution did not originally allow it. (The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, did.)

“The Constitution, when it was signed, it did not even allow a federal income tax,” he said.

“Right!” shouted one man in the audience.

“And that sounds like a good way to limit the size of the federal government,” Mr. DeMint said.
1493 2010-02-19 Dozens of auto repair shops and service stations in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County faked the results of emissions tests, giving nearly 21,000 cars and light trucks passing grades, state environmental officials said Thursday.

Officials with the State Department of Environmental Conservation said they had issued citations to 40 of about 3,500 inspection sites in the region for granting inspection certificates for vehicles that were not tested.

To pass the annual state emissions inspection, a car or truck is connected to a machine that checks the vehicle’s computerized emissions control system and sends the information to the State Department of Motor Vehicles. But the repair shops and service stations that were cited attached the inspection equipment to an electronic device that simulated the test.

“New York State does this program because we want clean air and because we need to comply with the federal Clean Air Act,” said Steven E. Flint, a director with the Environmental Conservation Department’s air resources division. “When people start cheating the system,” Mr. Flint said, “it deprives air quality of that benefit.”

The emissions testing is part of a program instituted in 2005 that seeks to keep tailpipe gases and other pollution within regulated standards by checking that a vehicle’s emissions monitoring computer system is in good working order. State officials said this was the first time they had encountered electronic devices simulating the inspections since the program, for vehicles manufactured in 1996 or later, started. Earlier testing monitored emissions directly from the tailpipe.

Although the emissions testing costs $37, repairs to vehicles that fail the test can cost much more.

Investigators for the Department of Motor Vehicles flagged 20,773 cases of fraudulent inspections from March 2008 to September 2009 at 27 sites in the Bronx, 4 in Manhattan, 4 in Suffolk County, 3 in Nassau County and 1 each in Westchester County and Brooklyn. The stations face potential fines of $375 to $15,000 for the first offense and up to $22,500 for each ensuing offense.
1494 2010-02-19 VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Commissioner Gary Bettman on Thursday offered the most publicly detailed list of reasons yet for the National Hockey League’s longstanding position not to commit to participation in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

“It costs us money; it disrupts our season,” Bettman said about the N.H.L. shutting down for two weeks every four years to take part in the Winter Games. “The value of the contracts of our players who are here: $2.1 billion. To be at these Olympics we must basically hand over control of our most important asset, our players.”

Speaking at a joint news conference with René Fasel, the president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, Bettman stressed that the league had not decided about allowing its players to participate in the Sochi Games.

While praising the atmosphere at the Vancouver Games, he said that a number of issues had arisen over which the league had no control.

“We’re hearing complaints from people about our broadcast schedule, where games are being carried,” he said, referring to NBC’s practice of shuttling hockey coverage among channels like MSNBC, CNBC and USA, sometimes in the middle of games.
1495 2010-02-19 A former senior executive at the Swiss banking giant UBS has agreed to pay a $2.75 million settlement to resolve claims of insider trading in auction-rate securities, the New York attorney general’s office saidThursday.

The executive, David Shulman, was formerly the global head of the municipal securities group and the head of fixed income for the Americas unit of UBS Securities.

The New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, and regulators in other states are conducting civil and criminal investigations to determine whether Wall Street firms that sold auction-rate securities did so improperly by portraying them as safe when they were not. The securities, which are typically sold to corporations, wealthy individual investors and municipalities, are debt instruments issued by nonprofit groups, cities and loan companies.

Mr. Shulman is the second former UBS executive to be identified in Mr. Cuomo’s investigation. In October 2008, David Aufhauser reached a $6.5 million settlement with Mr. Cuomo’s office to resolve claims of insider trading in auction-rate securities. Mr. Aufhauser was general counsel of UBS’s investment bank, and before that was the top in-house lawyer at the Treasury Department and served on the Justice Department’s corporate fraud task force.

The attorney general’s office said that its investigation into UBS included an examination of Mr. Shulman’s personal trading of auction-rate securities. It said that from August 2006 to August 2008, Mr. Shulman was UBS’s highest-ranking executive with daily responsibility for the Wall Street firm’s auction-rate securities program. Mr. Shulman left UBS in August 2008, after being placed on administrative leave a month earlier.

Mr. Cuomo’s office said that in early December 2007, Mr. Shulman discovered that the value of auction-rate securities, in particular for those tied to student loans, was tottering, even as the bank continued to sell them to investors. It said that Mr. Shulman instructed his broker to sell, ahead of auction for the securities, $1.45 million in student-loan auction-rate securities that he held. The securities were sold to UBS’s short-term trading desk, which Mr. Shulman oversaw. Two months later, in February 2008, the $300 billion market for auction-rate securities came to a standstill.

Mr. Cuomo’s office has barred Mr. Shulman from working in the securities industry until January 2011.
1496 2010-02-19 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo have received clearance from regulators in Washington and Europe to proceed with a search partnership intended to challenge Google.

Microsoft and Yahoo announced on Thursday that the partnership had been approved without restrictions by the Justice Department and the European Commission. Under the 10-year agreement, Microsoft’s Bing search engine will process search requests and steer search-related ads on Yahoo. Yahoo will get 88 percent of the revenue generated from the ads placed alongside the search results on its sites.

The companies said they would begin carrying out the deal by shifting Yahoo’s search platforms to Microsoft. They hope to move most advertisers and publishers before the 2010 holiday season, but may wait until 2011 if necessary, and expect to complete the process by early 2012.

This deal came about after the Justice Department indicated in 2008 that it would fight Yahoo’s plan to team up with Google on search. That rejection led Yahoo to turn to Microsoft, which had once offered to buy Yahoo in its entirety.

A statement from the European Commission said the Yahoo-Microsoft partnership “would not significantly impede effective competition.”
1497 2010-02-19 With interest rates at low levels, inflation hawks have warned that price increases may be around the corner. While a government report on Thursday heightened those concerns, economists said inflation still remained largely in check.

Producer prices in the United States increased 1.4 percent in January — outpacing expectations of a 0.8 percent jump — mostly because of an increase in gasoline prices. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the increase was 0.3 percent, compared with a forecast of 0.1 percent.

Even the small fluctuations in price levels were enough to prompt talk of creeping inflation. While economists emphasized the need to remain vigilant about prices, they agreed that inflation was not an immediate concern.

In addition, the Federal Reserve took its first step to normalizing lending on Thursday by raising the interest rate it charges on emergency loans to banks.

“We’re going to be generally grinding toward higher inflation,” said Conrad F. DeQuadros, an economist for RDQ Economics. “Will it hit problematic levels in 2010? I don’t think so. But it does have the potential for uncomfortably high inflation readings down the road.”

Economists attributed much of the rise in wholesale prices, measured by the government’s Producer Price Index, to an 11.5 percent jump in gasoline prices, the result of rising fuel costs.

The unexpected increase in nonfood and energy prices was partly caused by a 1.9 increase in the cost of light trucks. Those prices tend to be volatile, economists said.

1502 2010-02-20 Ridership on New York City’s buses and subways declined last year for the first time in six years, apparently a victim of the economic downturn.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority recorded 2.31 billion rides in 2009, officials said Friday. Since the late 1960s, only one other year has seen higher demand for the system: 2008, when about 63.5 million more trips were taken. The 2.7 percent drop was the first decline since 2003, another period of economic trouble.

Subway ridership fell the most in Manhattan, particularly in the Midtown business district, a drop that transit officials attributed in part to higher unemployment fueled by rounds of layoffs in the major industries, like media and finance, that have headquarters in the area. All five boroughs saw small declines in bus and subway ridership.

“I don’t think people have left the system because they don’t like the system; I think it’s all economic-based,” said Andrew Albert, the chairman of the New York City Transit Riders’ Council. “It’s very small, considering the job losses.”

Buses and subways did better than the region’s other mass transit options. Weekday ridership fell 5 percent on the Long Island Rail Road, 4.2 percent on Metro-North and 3.6 percent on PATH trains. The Staten Island Ferry, however, enjoyed 5.3 percent more trips than in 2008.

Still, the news was not good for the transportation authority, which is weighing service cuts as it struggles with a budget shortfall of about $400 million. Lower ridership meant $2.1 million less fare revenue than projected, straining a crucial source of financing.

The popularity of unlimited-ride MetroCards, which reduce the price of a single ride, meant that, on average, subway rides cost only 8.5 cents more last year than in 2008, despite a June fare increase that raised a single ride to $2.25 from $2. The average fare across the system rose to $1.41 from $1.33 in 2008.
1503 2010-02-20 The Blackstone Group has reached a deal to reorganize the debt load of Hilton Hotels, shoring up the finances of one of its crown jewels, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday. The deal would cut Hilton’s debt burden to about $16 billion from $20 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Blackstone will inject an additional $800 million of capital to buy back Hilton’s debt at a discount, this person said. The maturities of some of Hilton’s debt will also be pushed back. A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment. Blackstone agreed to acquire Hilton in 2007 for $26 billion. Negotiations with Hilton’s lenders have been going on for months. One complication is that several billions of dollars of Hilton debt is held by an unusual entity: the Federal Reserve, which assumed loans to Hilton made by Bear Stearns when it helped rescue the investment bank almost two years ago. News of the deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal online.
1504 2010-02-20 Aid groups are trying to address the problem by distributing more than 10,000 latrines and portable toilets, and employing dozens of new desludging trucks to empty the toilets. But these solutions seem to be a stopgap measure, at best.

“It’s a drop in the ocean of what’s needed,” said Jessica Barry, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is distributing latrines with special sludge pumps. “You can have 100,000 latrines, but you need a way to remove the excrement.”

With the number of people displaced here by the earthquake estimated at 700,000, emptying the latrines from one location creates a new problem when the waste is disposed in another. Haiti, a nation of 10 million, does not have a single sewage treatment plant. Trucks often simply take the waste to the Troutier trash dump near the slums of Cité Soleil on this city’s edge.

The trucks empty into pits filled with medical waste like intravenous bags and garbage. Smoke billows from burning piles of trash. One truck from a private company, Sanco, with its motto “Fighting for a Clean Environment” emblazoned on its side, did not bother to go to a pit, dumping its cargo of human waste on the open ground.

A squatter community of a dozen families, including some new arrivals whose homes were destroyed in the earthquake, tries to eke out its survival by scavenging in this setting.

“There’s food to be found here, and sometimes wood to cook with,” said Mackinson Charles, 14, who wandered around the pools of waste with his brother, Mickenson, 12, as dusk fell here one day this week. Four other boys accompanied them, including two who were barefoot. “This is where we live,” Mackinson said.

The human waste problem was daunting even before the earthquake. Lacking a municipal sewage system, many families here employ a socially scorned class of nocturnal latrine cleaners known in Creole as the “bayakou.” They descend into latrines to clean excrement with their hands, before transporting it in carts to improvised disposal sites.

The current problem is part of a politically delicate debate over the future of the camps themselves. Even as many of those living in the camps dig in, building wooden shacks instead of resigning themselves to living in tents or under sheets, some here are calling for the camps to be broken up.

“We need to acknowledge that the sanitation problems cannot be solved in the current camp structure, and that what’s needed is to resettle people in cities outside Port-au-Prince,” said Peter Haas, executive director of A.I.D.G., an American nonprofit group that does development work in Haiti.

Viva Rio, a Brazilian nongovernmental group, has begun operating a project in the Kai Nou slum in this city’s central commercial district that turns human excrement into a biogas used as fuel for cooking and electricity.

“This crisis can trigger innovation for Haiti, allowing us to move beyond the desperation you see now,” said Volmir Fachini, the director of the project, which the group hopes to emulate in a sprawling tent camp of about 3,500 families adjacent to Kai Nou. “The solutions to the waste problem are within our grasp.”

Still, disease specialists fear that the scale of the problem could soon overwhelm such projects.

Robert Redfield, a co-founder of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, cited the example of a 1994 outbreak of cholera in refugee camps in Congo among the hundreds of thousands who fled Rwanda at the time.

“The real culprit right now is the flies, which become vectors by taking fecal waste from one place to another,” said Dr. Redfield, who got sick himself with salmonella typhi while working in Haiti this month. “This means you can control what you eat and still get something,” he said. “The arrival of the rains could make malaria and dengue more problematic as well.”

Some families seeking shelter have nowhere else to turn. “This is my life now, my family’s life,” said Sindia Michel, 33, who moved to the Troutier trash dump after her shack collapsed in the earthquake. She scavenged for firewood with one of her five children near the pits of excrement.

“I do what it takes to endure,” she said.
1505 2010-02-20 Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, seeking to overturn her loss in the presidential election, urged judges on Friday to scrutinize evidence that she said showed voter fraud. Ms. Tymoshenko is challenging the Feb. 7 election, which the opposition leader, Viktor F. Yanukovich, won by 3.48 percentage points. The Higher Administrative Court in Kiev is expected to rule in the next few days. Mr. Yanukovich’s inauguration is scheduled for Thursday.
1506 2010-02-20 The chief executive of the General Motors Company, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., will receive a salary of $1.7 million this year, and stock awards that will bring his total pay package to $9 million at a later date, the automaker said on Friday.

G.M. also said a former chief executive, Fritz Henderson, who was forced out of the job in December, had been rehired as a consultant and would be paid $59,090 a month. He will work 20 hours a month, the company said.

Mr. Whitacre’s total compensation is larger than Mr. Henderson’s was when he was the chief executive. Mr. Henderson received a total pay package worth nearly $5.5 million.

In addition to the cash salary that took effect Jan. 1, Mr. Whitacre’s pay package includes $5.3 million in stock to be awarded in increments starting in 2012, plus another stock award worth $2 million. Details including the timing of the $2 million stock award still need to be worked out, a G.M. spokeswoman said.

Initially named interim chief executive by the board of directors in December, Mr. Whitacre was officially awarded the title in January.

At the time, Mr. Whitacre, who is also chairman, said the reason he was taking the job was to bring stability to the top of the struggling automaker.
1507 2010-02-20 While most major card lenders sharply cut back on direct mail last year, almost nine out of 10 new card offers were attached to a rewards program that appeals to big spenders, according to Synovate, a global marketing research firm. Only six in 10 applications were for a rewards card program in 2007, before the financial crisis struck.

Typically, basic credit card perks like frequent-flier miles and cash-back bonuses can be had for no annual fee to around $75. Chase Card Services, for example, long promoted a United Mileage Plus Signature Visa card with a $60 annual fee that offered customers one mile for every $1 spent. In August, it started a new blitz to convince people that it would be worth paying annual fees of up to $315 more for a host of glittering perks.

For a $130 annual fee, United Select cardholders can receive double or triple miles on ticket purchases. For a $375 annual fee, United Club cardholders can get added bonuses, like access to airport flight lounges.

American Express has been testing a new Zync charge card since December modeled after the way iPhone users customize the device. For a $25 annual fee, cardholders will be enrolled in a basic rewards program. Then, for around $20 each, they can choose from a number of different “packs” carrying additional benefits, like one offering double points on travel-related purchases or another offering discounts on mobile phone accessories and bonus points on paying their monthly bill. More packs are coming.

Some liken the changes to the marketing sleight-of-hand of the airlines, which have kept their base fares low while tacking on new fees for pillows, peanuts and baggage. The risk is that banks will alienate customers who notice that they are paying more for the total cost of the flight.

“That is the tightrope that banks are walking right now, and it is a real high-wire act,” said Robert K. Hammer, a longtime investment banker who specializes in the credit card industry.

Along with other measures, he estimated that the renewed focus on annual fee income — which totaled $6 billion in 2009 and is likely to climb higher — might help lenders recoup about one-third of their projected shortfall.

Other card lenders are cutting costs by making it harder to earn rewards points for airline tickets, big-screen TVs and other prized items. Banks have also ratcheted up the use of blackout periods, redemption fees and other restrictions that frustrated customers whose loyalty they wanted. The average rewards point, once worth as much as 1 or 2 cents, was effectively devalued to less than a penny by 2008, industry experts estimate.

Chase, for example, has overhauled its once generous Freedom rewards card no fewer than three times in the last three years.

In 2006, cardholders were offered a 1 percent rebate in cash or points on all purchases, and 3 percent on items bought at grocery stores, gas stations and fast-food restaurants. By last year, Chase’s Freedom program was far more restrictive. Cardholders had to register online to be eligible to receive the 3 percent rebates — and they were available only in three categories that rotated each quarter.

“If Chase doesn’t want to give out as many rewards, fine — but goodbye,” said Scott Friend, a 30-year-old from New York who recently dropped his Chase Freedom credit card for a Capital One card offering cash back.

Chase officials say that they changed the Freedom program to reflect new consumer insights and are planning yet another round of changes. Next month, all Chase Freedom cardholders will give up their existing benefits and be moved into a new cash-back rewards program offering a 5 percent rebate in three categories that change each quarter. (The catch is that cardholders will have to sign up to receive the benefits and will no longer qualify for a coveted $50 bonus.) Meanwhile, Chase is aggressively marketing a more upscale and less lucrative rewards card known as the Chase Sapphire, which offers one rewards point for every $1 of spending.

To further compensate for declining fee revenue, some lenders are simply adding annual charges to cards that did not have them — even if no rewards are attached. Citigroup, for example, will begin charging many cardholders a $60 annual fee in April unless they cancel their account by next month. (The fee will be credited back if they spend more than $2,400 over the next year.) Bank of America similarly notified tens thousands of customers that they would start seeing an annual fee of $29 to $99 on their February statements.

Credit card companies also reap a big portion of their income from the transaction fees that merchants pay each time a customer swipes a credit card. And the more upscale rewards credit cards in use, the more money they can make.

Retailers pay about 2.1 percent of the transaction value on a purchase made by a high-end rewards cardholder, compared to around 1.47 percent for an ordinary customer, according to Visa data. For a typical $40 purchase with a rewards card, for example, a retailer would pay about 94 cents, compared with a 67- to 70-cent fee if an ordinary card is swiped. The retailers also may increasingly finance extra card benefits themselves, instead of splitting the cost with the banks.

But merchants warn that the shift to more rewards will raise the cost of goods as they pass along the fees. “It’s like this huge, secret annual fee for credit,” said Mallory Duncan, the chief lawyer for the National Retail Federation. “It’s not good for us, and it is not good for our customers.”
1508 2010-02-20 Not everyone apparently thinks the Chicago Cubs are lovable losers deserving of sympathy — and tax dollars.

The Chicago White Sox, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Major League Baseball are opposing a bill that would add a proposed 8 percent ticket surcharge on all Cactus League games to help pay for the Cubs’ new spring training facility in Mesa, Ariz. They said their fans should not have to pay more for their tickets to help a rival team.

The surcharge, plus an extra $1 fee on cars rented in Maricopa County, home to 13 of the 15 Cactus League teams, was included in a bill approved this week by the Arizona House’s commerce committee in Phoenix.

A sponsor of the bill said the Cubs deserved the $58 million that the state would spend on the team because thousands of Cubs fans visit Arizona every spring. He also said the other teams that train in Arizona would benefit because money from the fees would be directed to the Cactus League and because plenty of Cubs fans visit their stadiums, too.

“When the Cubs play in their stadium, they sell out and when they play elsewhere, they sell out,” said the state representative John McComish, one sponsor of the bill. “The Cubs benefit the entire Cactus League.”
1509 2010-02-20 For example, the letter states that when the child said that he didn’t know the British system of naming musical notes, he was told by the production staff member the names of four specific notes that “he needed to know,” including semibreve for whole note, crotchet for quarter note and quaver for eighth note. “He told us that it was very important to know that the hemidemisemiquaver is the British name for the sixty-fourth note,” the letter says.

For privacy reasons, the F.C.C. redacted the names of the author of the letter and the child contestant. The letter states that the child went to the studio for a taping on Dec. 8, but after a meeting with an attorney for Mark Burnett Productions, at which one of the child’s parents raised issues about some of the planned questions and the contest’s rules, the child’s appearance on the show was canceled.

Section 508 of the Communications Act of 1934 makes it illegal for anyone to give, with the intent to deceive the viewing or listening public, assistance that will affect the outcome of a “purportedly bona fide contest of intellectual knowledge or intellectual skill.” That issue was behind the quiz show scandals of the 1950s.

Whether that occurred with the Fox game show, which has not been broadcast, is the subject of the F.C.C.’s inquiry, according to a person involved in the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. As a matter of practice, the F.C.C. will neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.

A spokeswoman for Fox Broadcasting said the network would not comment beyond its January statement.

An assistant to Mr. Burnett said on Friday that he was traveling overseas and unavailable for comment. Other officials at Mark Burnett Productions did not respond to a phone call and an e-mail message asking about the allegations in the letter.

The letter also alleges that a day before the contestant’s scheduled taping, the producers issued a rule change giving a player a second chance, or “reload,” if he failed to successfully answer any of the first four of 10 rounds of questions.

Attached to the letter is a document titled “Addendum to the Series Rules,” which states that “in the event the Little Genius answers question 1, 2, 3, or 4 incorrectly, the contestants will be entitled to the one (1) time opportunity, but not the obligation, to restart game play with a new question set.”

The troubles are a rare setback for Mr. Burnett, who is one of the most prolific producers of reality programming. He has created programs for all four major networks, including “Survivor,” “The Apprentice,” “Shark Tank” and “Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?”

In an interview last fall, he spoke confidently of his close involvement with every show. But in recent years he has been spreading himself more thinly, taking on numerous cable series and producing television events, including the MTV Movie Awards and the People’s Choice Awards.
1510 2010-02-20 The next few years are expected to be bad for commercial real estate largely because the rosy predictions made when the buildings were purchased in 2005 and 2006 have not come true. First, the values of those buildings have plummeted, as much as 45 percent in some instances. That is going to make it difficult for the owners to refinance their mortgages over the next few years. Second, the recession has reduced the rents and occupancy rates on which those inflated values were based.

But what’s bad for an owner may be good for an investor.

STATE OF PLAY The opportunities in commercial real estate run the gamut of risk, from buying undeveloped land to buying stock in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which invest in property and mortgages.

Mike Ryan, head of wealth management research for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management, said while there were risks in commercial real estate, they would not be as bad as many bearish analysts had predicted and certainly not on the level of the residential real estate crash.

“The notion that the other shoe is about to drop and we’ll see a wholesale liquidation of property is overdone,” he said. But, he added, “We’re not saying people should plow in.”

Yet Mr. Frame said he saw the coming refinancing crisis in commercial real estate as a continuum of what has been happening with other securities in the last 18 months. “Our job has been to look through the capital markets and identify where there’s been a scarcity of capital,” he said, meaning where investors sold their positions quickly and fearfully. The first opportunities to take advantage of a turnaround were with convertible bonds and private equity. “Now,” Mr. Frame said, “we think the opportunity in real estate is much broader than it was 12 months ago.”

OPTIONS So how are people seeking to profit in commercial real estate? This depends on whether they are passive investors, who want to allocate some money to real estate, or entrepreneurs seeking to buy buildings.

Many investors who did not make their fortunes in real estate remain cautious. “You have to help them view real estate as private equity because you’re locking up your money for some period of time,” said Joanne Jensen, a private banker at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management.

But if they’re going to invest in real estate, they want the security of high-quality investments. “I’m speaking to a lot of real estate investors, and what they’ve been telling me is there’s been a bifurcation between the ‘A’ quality buildings and everything else,” Ms. Jensen said.

One intriguing strategy is to buy the underlying mortgage debt of buildings whose value was inflated. The debt is now trading at a deep discount. This may sound risky, particularly if the owner walks away from that debt, as happened with Stuyvesant Town. But Mr. Frame sees it as a way to make either a little or a lot of money.

He described one possibility: a building was purchased for $100 million in 2006. It is now worth less, but the underlying mortgage is still $50 million, and it is coming due next year. The owner is probably going to have a tough time refinancing the mortgage without putting in more money. That uncertainty is reflected in the price of the debt.

“Say it’s 70 cents on the dollar, or $40 million for the first-lien mortgage,” he said. “If, in the next year, I get paid off, I get a 12 percent return. If not, I own the building at 60 percent off the original purchase price.”

In many cases, he said, clients are hoping they do not get paid back because the return from owning the building could be far greater. But the risk is they may have to hold that property for at least several years.

Some of his other ideas carry the same caveat: they require time. In this category, he included buying land prepared for developments that have stalled or buying loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The agency acquired these from banks and has bundled them into packages to be sold off.

Hotels are one area in which the investment turnaround could come faster. Their occupancy rates plummeted in the recession, and many were further hurt by having too much debt. “The most upside can come from hotels, if we get an uptick in the economy,” Mr. Frame said. “But the risk is high.”

Still, he said he believed that all these seemingly risky investments were actually predicated on caution. “We’re not taking an optimistic view of the recovery,” he said. “As long as it doesn’t get dramatically worse, we’ll be O.K.”

REIT stocks are a more liquid alternative. They went through their own steep decline last year. In March 2009, REIT stocks were down 75 percent from their February 2007 high, according to the leading REIT index. The index had rebounded to half of its peak, but REIT stocks slid again after the Federal Reserve raised its lending rate to banks on Thursday. This is not necessarily a bad thing for long-term investors.

“We think REITs are trading roughly at the net-asset value” of the properties they own, said Thomas N. Bohjalian, a portfolio manager at Cohen & Steers, a real estate investment firm. “And that is not the ceiling; it’s the floor.”

What is more significant than stock price, he said, is Cohen & Steers’s prediction that dividends on REIT stocks will grow by an average of 12 percent over each of the next five years. REITs are legally required to pay out 90 percent of their taxable income annually. In flush times, they were paying out a good portion of their cash flow as well. As income from REIT-owned properties rebounds, so will the dividends.

CAUTION All these investment ideas are predicated upon patience and a healthy stomach for risk. With REITs, for example, Mr. Bohjalian said he did not expect double-digit dividend growth to start until 2011.

This patience works two ways. Ms. Jensen has several clients who have made their fortunes in real estate but have struggled to find properties at the discounts they expected. “They’re not willing to do a deal that doesn’t make sense,” she said.

That may be a good mantra for any investor.
1511 2010-02-20 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A missile believed to have been fired Thursday from an American drone killed the younger brother of a top militant commander in the North Waziristan tribal area, according to several Pakistani security and intelligence officials, residents in Waziristan and a friend of the commander’s family.

The militant commander, Sirajuddin Haqqani, appeared to have been the target of the attack. Mr. Haqqani, who the Americans say operates from a base in North Waziristan, took over major responsibilities for the family’s militant network in recent years from his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, who has been reported to be ill. The Americans blame the Haqqani network for helping plan the suicide bombing against the C.I.A. base in Afghanistan in December in which C.I.A. operatives and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed.

The brother, Mohammad Haqqani, was killed along with three others when their white station wagon was hit by a missile in Dande Darpakhel, a village in North Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan. Americans believe that Sirajuddin Haqqani is closely affiliated with Al Qaeda and that his network is the most potent one working against international forces in eastern and central Afghanistan.

Dande Darpakhel is just north of Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan, and is considered the main base of the Haqqani network and family. It has been a repeated target of missile strikes, one of which was believed to have killed several members of the clan last year.

According to a family friend of the Haqqanis, Mohammad Haqqani was killed on his way to see his brother, the commander. The family friend in the village said that Mohammad Haqqani, who was about 20, was not an active member of the militant network and that his brother had wanted him to pursue religious studies away from the area so he could lead a more normal life.

1520 2010-02-21 After the publication of an article about Metho Nelson, a formerly homeless 23-year-old who has been working and attending school while living in a shelter, Mr. Nelson’s dearest wish came true. He was offered a scholarship to Brooklyn College.

An article about Wayne Knight, who fell behind on his bills after being severely injured at work, prompted a donor to come forward to help him pay $1,200 in back rent and $3,000 toward a hospital debt. Ms. Raaum from the Brooklyn Bureau reported that he was surprised and humbled by the gift.

Readers were particularly moved by the plight of Essence Griffin, 8, abandoned by her mother and cared for by her terminally ill grandmother. Essence had repeated kindergarten once and was in danger of slipping behind further. After reading her story, Barnes and Noble Corporate Communications donated a $500 gift card for new books.

An elementary school teacher in Binghamton pledged to send books and art supplies, and a professor from Rockland County pledged money.

Suman Rai, a pro-democracy organizer in Nepal, was driven out of his country by sword-wielding Maoists who tried to persuade him to join their cause. His wife, Saraswati, and 4-year-old daughter, Fortune, remained behind. Unrelated to his story being told in The New York Times, but still a welcome development, they have since received approval to come to the United States. Saraswati and Fortune arrived on Feb. 13.

Despite the second year of an economic downturn that has led to double-digit unemployment and shuttered storefronts from the Bronx to Madison Avenue, Neediest Cases articles attracted $6,280,242 in donations through Feb. 9. However, that was significantly less than last year’s campaign, which netted $6,964,031 . This year, 10,428 readers donated, 400 fewer than last year.

In the 98 years that the Neediest Cases Fund has operated, it has taken in a total of $182,196,757 from 1,085,957 gifts, ranging from just a few dollars to pledges of $100,000.

Wall Street continued its 19-year-old tradition of giving. Citibank and Goldman Sachs raised a combined total of $157,963.26 for the fund, through interoffice weight-loss contests, dress-down days and bake sales. That was a $17,257 increase from last year. This was particularly heartening news for the financial sector; last year, the first of the financial crisis, saw a $40,000 drop-off in contributions compared with the year before.

But Amanda Tobin, a second-year analyst in risk management at Goldman Sachs, speculated that the industry might be recovering.

“Things are looking up. I’m optimistic,” she said at a meeting at The New York Times building this month when she dropped off the check.

The New York Times Company Foundation will make up the shortfall in donations — average annual totals for the last decade were closer to $8 million — by drawing down $6 million from the Neediest Cases Fund endowment. This is an unusually large amount — typically, the endowment augments the fund with $1 million annually.

“This fund, of all funds, should be countercyclical,” said Jack Rosenthal, the departing president of The Times Company Foundation. “If you’re not going to use these funds when people are really hurting, when are you going to use them?”
1521 2010-02-21 You write that Democratic leadership legislation to address the recent Supreme Court decision in Citizens United is needed “to help keep special interest money in check” until some future court reverses this decision.

But special interests haven’t been in check for a very long time, long before this decision by the court, and they won’t be in check even if the fixes advocated by Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Chris Van Hollen are enacted tomorrow.

The “fund-raising Congress” has a trust problem. Voters believe that money buys results in Congress. They don’t believe that politicians are looking out for the public’s interest.

That’s why part of the legislative response to Citizens United ought to include putting elections into the hands of voters through citizen-financed elections like the bipartisan Fair Elections legislation now advancing in Congress. Nothing would do more to both blunt the influence of special-interest money and repair the broken public trust than its passage.

1522 2010-02-21 Cindy Warren has lived in the wine country town of St. Helena for more than 20 years, raised three children there and served on the school board since 2005. So it came as something of a shock when, one day after church, she bumped into a longtime acquaintance at the grocery store who gave her an ice-cold reception.

“She literally turned on her heels and walked away,” Ms. Warren, a former fashion model, said last week in an interview.

The problem? Ms. Warren and her erstwhile friend are on opposite sides of a bitter fight over public schools in St. Helena, a picturesque village of about 6,000 near the northern end of the Napa Valley.

The battle over an election to recall four of the five members of the school board has pitted neighbor against neighbor and friend and against friend, driving a wedge through a small school district that has slightly fewer than 1,400 students. The factions have taken to sitting on opposite sides of the high school gym and staking out separate bleachers on the Little League field. Several pro-recall parents took their children off a swim team after the coach sided with the board members.

“It has torn this community apart,” said Ms. Warren, who sells real estate in the valley.

It is too soon to tell whether the effort to oust Ms. Warren and three colleagues is an aberration prompted by the community’s peculiar politics or a sign of things to come in the Bay Area and the rest of California. As education budgets are squeezed by the recession and its effect on tax revenues, parents across the state are bound to question the judgment of those they have elected to run the schools.
1523 2010-02-21 “The bigger the machine, the more Truth they knew; and the more Truth they knew, the more they could bet,” he writes. Along with their lust for the Truth, many of the quants shared a love of poker.

In 1962, Mr. Thorp, a former mathematics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote a best-selling book, “Beat the Dealer,” which laid out a math formula for winning at blackjack. Three years later, he was a co-author of “Beat the Market: A Scientific Stock Market System,” which showed how to use math formulas to identify and profit from short-term discrepancies in prices of stocks and bonds. Both books became quant bibles.

Successive generations of quants celebrated Mr. Thorp’s dual legacy at the annual Wall Street Poker Night Tournament at the St. Regis Hotel, a charity event started in 2003 to benefit math programs in New York City public schools.

“Skill at poker meant skill at trading,” Mr. Patterson says. “And it potentially meant something even more: the magical presence of alpha,” a quant word for individual skill at beating markets.

The virtually exclusive use of mathematical models, Mr. Patterson says, was what separated the younger cohorts of quants from their Wall Street forebears. Unlike Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch, the quants did not focus on so-called market fundamentals like what goods or services a particular company actually produced. Seldom if ever did they act on old-fashioned gut instinct. Instead, they focused on factors like how cheap a stock was relative to the rest of the market or how quickly its price had risen or fallen.

Therein was the quants’ flaw, according to Mr. Patterson. Pioneers like Mr. Thorp understood that while the math world and the financial world have much in common, they aren’t always in sync. The quant traders’ model emphasized the most likely moves a stock or bond price could make. It largely ignored the possibility of big jolts caused by human factors, especially investor panics.

“The model soon became so ubiquitous that, hall-of-mirrors-like, it became difficult to tell the difference between the model and the market itself,” Mr. Patterson declares.

Move ahead to August 2007 and beyond, when markets swooned on doubts about subprime mortgages. Stocks that the model predicted were bound to go up went sharply down, and vice versa. Events that were supposed to happen only once in 10,000 years happened three days in a row.

With huge amounts of cash on the line in highly leveraged trades, the quants were crushed. Mr. Muller’s unit at Morgan Stanley, for example, which had accounted for up to a quarter of the firm’s annual profits from 1996 to 2006, lost $300 million in a single day, Mr. Patterson writes.

According to Mr. Patterson, Mr. Weinstein’s formula-driven trades left Deutsche Bank in a gigantic hole. Mr. Griffin converted his nearly toppled hedge fund, the Citadel Investment Group, into an investment bank, and Mr. Asness, who lost an unspecified amount, turned to investing in relatively low-risk mutual funds.

MR. PATTERSON’S compelling account is marred by some poor editing and sloppy fact-checking. Several chapters and subsections begin with historical flashbacks that are both jarring and confusing. Harry Reid is a United States senator from Nevada, not Arizona. And the late Texas Congressman Charles Wilson was tall and lean, not “heavyset.”

But Mr. Patterson is onto a big story that already begs follow-up. He warns that quants have recently begun tracking highly leveraged exchange-traded funds, applying similar math models they once used to trade stocks and bonds.

Perhaps even more worrisome, he says, is the advent of computerized stock exchanges called dark pools, which, unlike the publicly visible New York Stock Exchange, match buy and sell orders anonymously in cyberspace. Who knows? Mr. Patterson may soon be writing a sequel: “The Quants Strike Back.”
1524 2010-02-21 I agree with Gretchen Morgenson that policy makers should calculate and disclose the cost of the subsidies and implicit guarantees that government bailouts entail (“Future Bailouts of America,” Fair Game, Feb. 14).

The full amount, however, is much greater than the dollars we must pay directly. We must also consider the tremendous costs in terms of both moral hazard and opportunity cost.

The first is the increased risk we face by shielding larger firms from the consequences of profligate risk-taking. If we send gamblers into a casino with a guarantee that they can keep their winnings while taxpayers will cover their losses (provided they’re large enough), what kind of behavior should we expect?

The opportunity cost is the price of keeping top-heavy incumbents in the market when efficiency alone would dictate that more prudent, leaner competitors devour their assets and market share.

We might enhance the political will necessary to resist bailouts with wider recognition that not only is no concern “too big to fail,” but that the bigger an incompetent institution is, the larger the social benefit of allowing it to fail.
1525 2010-02-21 Even when the Olympics isn’t shining a spotlight on it, skiing is a robust industry. Ski resorts in the United States have shown steady increases in revenue over the last five years, according to the research firm IbisWorld.

Even in 2009, as most industries were in a recessionary trough, ski resort revenue rose 2.3 percent from the year before, IbisWorld says. Revenue for 2010 is forecast to rise almost 6 percent, to $2.72 billion.

The industry has consolidated in recent years, and some small resorts have been pushed out of business, or bought by larger ones, IbisWorld says. Two companies — Intrawest and Vail Resorts — now attract 51 percent of industry revenue.

Despite a positive outlook, the ski industry is vulnerable to forces it cannot control — most notably the weather. One season of poor snowfall can take a big toll in the account books. And you can be sure that many an owner of a ski resort is wondering if climate change will affect the bottom line.
1526 2010-02-21 There are no shortages of ironies in Iraq. Some border on the surreal. In today’s politics, it is erstwhile Baathists and the Communist Party that speak a secular language more familiar to Americans. Yet the Americans have empowered ardently religious Shiite parties; one longstanding Shiite partner of the United States here was reported to have laid a wreath on the grave in Lebanon of Imad Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah figure accused of planning the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983.

But Order No. 1 may be the biggest irony. It was the first step in fashioning a system that seems to embrace brinkmanship, populated by once-exiled figures whom the United States brought to power. And in that system, perhaps only the United States can act as a broker to cut through the crisis and deadlock.

In that, it is a corollary of the apocryphal but often cited china-shop rule: you break it, you own it. These days, as the end draws near, the apt adage might be: you build it, you own it.

It is remarkable how much the American role here has changed over the years.

In 2003, American officials showed a singular ability to alienate people. One United States official back then dismissed Muktada al-Sadr, a radical Shiite cleric, as “big smoke, no fire.” That was before his followers launched two uprisings in five months against the American military. Hume Horan, a storied diplomat who died in 2004, was once tasked with telling tribal elders that the Americans had begun an occupation. Mr. Horan, who read the medieval poetry of the fourth Shiite imam in his off hours in Baghdad, delivered the news in flawless Arabic. But he well remembered the reaction of the tribesmen, almost choking on their sweet tea. “Ihtilal” evokes an occupied Palestine, not postwar Germany or Japan.

Even friends of America, sweltering in summer blackouts, marveled at its representatives’ incompetence: Was this really the same country that defeated Saddam Hussein in a few weeks?

These days, nearly everyone in Iraq deems the United States an arbiter. Iraqi politicians ritually bristle at its intervention, especially when it runs against their interests. But even they acknowledge the role it plays, one that has in some ways grown even as the Obama administration signals that Iraq will not be this president’s war.

The crisis over de-Baathification that started last month is a prime example. A commission that remains the legacy of Mr. Bremer’s order disqualified 511 parliamentary candidates for ties to the Baath Party. Secular and Sunni figures denounced the move as score-settling by Shiite parties. Those parties claimed they were simply following the law — which, these days, tends to be interpreted in the most pliable and opaque way. Those parties soon whipped up an anti-Baathist frenzy as cynical as it was effective among their core voters.

American officials expressed cautious concern, then worked zealously behind the scenes to find a solution, all the while claiming not to undermine Iraqi sovereignty.

“We do not have the power to be a Jedi knight and say to the Iraqis, ‘These are not the droids you are looking for,’ ” Mr. Hill said. “You can try it, but it usually doesn’t work.” But, he added later: “This is the kind of country that if you are not active, you are not there.” Its people, he said, “want to see that you care.”

At times, the Americans and United Nations personnel seemed more determined to resolve the crisis than Iraqi officials themselves. The notion of legitimacy has long bedeviled the political process here. For years, Sunnis contested it. So did Mr. Sadr and his followers. Now both are crucial constituencies in the electoral process. The de-Baathification move threatened to unravel those hard-won gains of inclusion, and threats of boycotting the vote soon followed.

Behind the crisis, some Iraqis soon said, lurked the Americans. Ali al-Lami, the head of the commission that barred the candidates, demanded that the American Embassy “stop its interference and pressure,” and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki bluntly warned Ambassador Hill not to overstep his place. Those on the losing side accused the Americans of not doing enough. Yet, with either fear or anticipation, most of them viewed the Americans as the single player with the power to intervene in a political process where crises seem the norm.

Sometimes that appreciation of American power was greater than the power it actually wielded; it remains to be seen whether the United States can help blunt the crisis’ impact on the credibility of the elections. “Iraqis need the Americans as mediators,” said Qassem Daoud, a Shiite lawmaker, former minister and candidate.

Not too far west, America may find a sobering lesson in another body politic shaped by another occupier.

In politics byzantine even by Middle East standards, competing sects in Lebanon — Maronite Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Sunni Muslim, Shiite Muslim, Druze — struggle for accommodation under a notion of consensus. That is almost always fleeting. Instead, politics is usually zero-sum across a landscape that, in the words of an architect there, offers no community “guarantees of its survival.” For years after the civil war, Syria, often brutally, reigned supreme, arbitrating the disputes. In 2005, it withdrew and, since then, the Lebanese system, without a kingmaker, has endured more years of deadlock than not. Few miss the Syrians there, but many long for the stability.

Mr. Bremer and his officials played a decisive role in fashioning an Iraqi political system redolent of Lebanon’s brand of confessionalism. Quotas are obligatory; power is rigidly contested on sectarian and ethnic lines. Deadlock often ensues, with each community seeing politics as winner-takes-all. It is resolved only when a kingmaker’s pressure finds a last-minute solution.

In America’s twilight in Iraq, the imperial role of arbiter, in a system that may yet prove unworkable, still belongs to it.

“I am not here to resolve that issue,” Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in Baghdad last month during the de-Baathification crisis. “This is for Iraqis to do, not for me.”

Perhaps. Still, someone would have served him well by mentioning an Arabic proverb.

“Kul ma qulna assa Allah, kul ma jadda al-rahil,” it goes. Loosely translated, it says, “Every time we say that we’re on our way, something new comes up.”
1527 2010-02-21 In contrast, the risk of taking action should frighten no one. Essentially, the risk is that if current estimates turn out to be wildly pessimistic, the money spent to curb greenhouse gases wouldn’t have been needed to save the planet. And yet that money would still have prevented substantial damage. (The M.I.T. model estimates a zero probability of the temperature rising by less than 3.6 degrees by 2100.)

Moreover, taking action won’t cost much. According to estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a tax of $80 a metric ton on carbon dioxide — or a cap-and-trade system with similar charges — would stabilize temperatures by midcentury.

This figure was determined, however, before the arrival of more pessimistic estimates on the pace of global warming. So let’s assume a tax of $300 a ton, just to be safe.

Under such a tax, the prices of goods would rise in proportion to their carbon footprints — in the case of gasoline, for example, by roughly $2.60 a gallon.

A sudden price increase of that magnitude could indeed be painful. But if phased in, it would cause much less harm. Facing steadily increasing fuel prices, for example, manufacturers would scramble to develop more efficient vehicles.

Even from the existing menu of vehicles, a family could trade in its Ford Explorer, getting 15 miles per gallon, for a 32-m.p.g. Ford Focus wagon, thereby escaping the effect of higher gasoline prices. Europeans, many of whom already pay $4 a gallon more than Americans do for gasoline, have adapted to their higher prices with little difficulty.

In short, the cost of preventing catastrophic climate change is astonishingly small, and it involves just a few simple changes in behavior.

The real problem with the estimates is that the outcome may be worse than expected. And that’s the strongest possible argument for taking action. In a rational world, that should be an easy choice, but in this case we appear to be headed in the wrong direction.

This strange state of affairs may be rooted in human psychology. As the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert put it in a 2006 op-ed article in The Los Angeles Times, “Global warming is bad, but it doesn’t make us feel nauseated or angry or disgraced, and thus we don’t feel compelled to rail against it as we do against other momentous threats to our species, such as flag burning.”

People tend to have strong emotions about topics like food and sex, and to create their own moral rules around these emotions, he says. “Moral emotions are the brain’s call to action,” he wrote. “If climate change were caused by gay sex, or by the practice of eating kittens, millions of protesters would be massing in the streets.”

But the human brain is remarkably flexible. Emotions matter, but so does logic. Even though we did not evolve under conditions that predisposed us to become indignant about climate change, we can learn to take such risks more seriously. But that won’t happen without better political leadership.

Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, has said that “the claim that global warming is caused by man-made emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science.” On compelling evidence, he’s wrong. Yet he and his colleagues have the power to block legislation on greenhouse gases.

WE don’t know how much hotter the planet will become by 2100. But the fact that we face “only” a 10 percent chance of a catastrophic 12-degree climb surely does not argue for inaction. It calls for immediate, decisive steps.

Most people would pay a substantial share of their wealth — much more, certainly, than the modest cost of a carbon tax — to avoid having someone pull the trigger on a gun pointed at their head with one bullet and nine empty chambers. Yet that’s the kind of risk that some people think we should take.
1528 2010-02-21 Emily Fong Mitchell and Stephen Samuel Fleming were married Saturday on the Island of Maui in Hawaii. Judge Joel E. August of Hawaii’s Second Circuit in Maui officiated at the Olowalu Plantation House in Lahaina.

1530 2010-02-21 PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) — Suzann Pettersen had her third straight bogey-free round Saturday, shooting a four-under-par 68 and opening a five-stroke lead in the season-opening Honda PTT L.P.G.A. Thailand.

The 2007 champion from Norway, Pettersen said she drank 12 bottles of water in the extreme heat during Saturday’s round on the Siam Country Club Pattaya Old Course. She is 18-under 198 for the tournament. after shooting a 66 and a 64 in the first two rounds.

“I’m playing very solid, gave myself some good chances on the greens,” she said. “I’m playing very good going into the last round.”

After a sluggish start, Song-Hee Kim of South Korea birdied three of the last four holes for a 68. She is 13-under 203.

“I played pretty good today, but it was hard on the front nine,” Kim said. “I didn’t get many birdies. On the back nine, I got more birdies and more confidence.”

After two error-free rounds, Ai Miyazato of Japan bogeyed twice to offset four birdies and finished with a two-under 70 for a share of third place at 204 with her compatriot Momoko Ueda (69) and Yani Tseng of Taiwan (68), the 2008 L.P.G.A. Championship winner.

Cristie Kerr, the 2007 United States Women’s Open champion, made eagles on 7 and 18 and shot a 66. She is tied for sixth place at 11-under with Hee Young Park (72) and Sweden’s Maria Hjorth (70).
1531 2010-02-21 “Innuendo and ridicule and false rumors can leave a long and lasting effect,” he said. “And it’s no surprise that this comes in the middle of a budget process, when special interests have a lot to lose, and at the beginning of a campaign, when other candidates will do anything to win.”

Those remarks hinted at Mr. Paterson’s strategy: to turn political weaknesses — he has few endorsements and just $3 million in the bank, while Mr. Cuomo has a campaign treasury five times the size of the governor’s — into strengths.

Mr. Paterson will remind voters that he has confronted obstacles since he was a boy, when his parents moved to Hempstead because the public schools in could not guarantee him an education without placing him in special education classes.

“I wanted to come back here to Hempstead, which is where I was taught to stand up for myself and to believe in myself,” Mr. Paterson said, “in spite of all the voices around me: You can’t play sports — you’re blind. You can’t go to law school — you’re handicapped. You can’t go into public service — you’re disabled.”

With little formal support from Democratic officials or labor unions, Mr. Paterson hopes to run as the anti-establishment candidate fighting for New Yorkers against Albany insiders, despite the more than two decades he spent in the State Senate. Against Mr. Cuomo’s Goliath, Mr. Paterson intends to play David.

The site Mr. Paterson chose to make his announcement illustrated the underdog nature of his campaign. Forgoing a more formal setting, the governor opted for a multipurpose room at Hofstra’s student center, a dimly lighted hall where his supporters sat on metal folding chairs.

Some of them said Mr. Paterson’s determination was the quality they admired most about him.

“He’s spoken very candidly about not giving up, not quitting,” said Darrin Green, 42, of Islip Terrace, N.Y. “You’ve got to fight the fight, stay true to what you believe in. It’s very easy to give up. The hardest thing is to stay in the fight.”

No statewide elected official joined the governor on Saturday. The rally included officials from Hempstead and members of the Nassau County Legislature, and Mr. Paterson was introduced by the town’s mayor, Wayne J. Hall Sr.

A spokesman for , whom Mr. Paterson appointed to the , said she had two prior commitments: a fund-raising run for in Central Park and the annual Chinese New Year parade in Queens. Thomas N. Suozzi, the former Nassau County executive, who is sometimes mentioned as a running mate for Mr. Paterson, was traveling in .

, whom Mr. Paterson appointed as lieutenant governor last summer, has said he is not interested in being on the ticket. The governor’s campaign manager, Richard Fife, said Saturday that Mr. Paterson had not set a timetable for choosing a running mate.

The rally at Hofstra was the first event in a weekend campaign tour that was to take Mr. Paterson to a union hall in Rochester on Saturday afternoon and a meeting with supporters on Sunday morning at a Greek restaurant outside .

Next Sunday, he will lead a rally in that will feature the campaign’s first major endorsements, Mr. Fife said. It was pushed back a week, he said, to accommodate supporters, although he would not say who they were.

Mr. Paterson is also racing the clock. Three months remain until the state’s Democratic convention, where delegates will select the party ticket. Without the support of at least 25 percent of the delegates, Mr. Paterson will be forced to collect thousands of signatures to land on the primary ballot.

“You know, it’s a tough environment out there right now,” said Jay Jacobs, who was appointed as chairman of the state by Mr. Paterson last year. “The mood of the electorate is tough, the current political environment is difficult and the governor is working to ensure that he is getting his poll numbers up and raising money.”

By nearly any measure, Mr. Paterson faces a steeper climb to election than any incumbent New York governor in recent memory.

He is seeking to be elected amid a major fiscal crisis, high unemployment and pervasive public disgust with Albany. And because he has spent most of his adult life in elected office, he may find it difficult to remake himself as a political outsider.

The governor remains highly unpopular with voters. According to a recent survey by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, 26 percent of voters approve of his performance as governor, the lowest ratings ever recorded in the poll’s 30-year history by an incumbent governor starting an election campaign. Mr. Paterson has lower job-approval ratings now than his predecessor, , did on the day after Mr. Spitzer was implicated in a prostitution scandal.

Many Democrats have already abandoned him, with some party officials and union leaders saying they will support Mr. Cuomo, who has not formally declared his interest in the job and appears in no hurry to do so. Aides to , worried about a weak candidate at the top of the New York ticket, made clear last fall that they would prefer Mr. Paterson step aside. And several weeks ago, representatives of more than a dozen county Democratic organizations met in Albany to discuss the governor’s prospects in open defiance of Mr. Jacobs, who had sought to delay the gathering.

In the months that Mr. Paterson has spent trying to win over his own party, the likely Republican candidate for governor, former Congressman , has steadily accumulated endorsements and support, and the party is rapidly coalescing behind his candidacy.

Assessing the difficulties the governor must overcome to win the nomination, Mr. Jacobs said, “I can’t predict what the ultimate outcome will be.”

Mr. Paterson, however, seemed certain on Saturday that he would prevail.

“I’m not going to give up,” Mr. Paterson repeated at the end of his speech, as the strains of the song “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” by McFadden & swelled over the loudspeakers. “I will win the election for governor this year.”
1532 2010-02-21 “IS this the same place?” my daughter asked.

It was a fair question. We had first gone to Traditions 118 on a busy Saturday night and the restaurant, in Granite Springs, was struggling. Water was not brought to the table until well after the entrees had arrived — despite repeated requests of our waiter, another server and even a maitre d’. Appetizers came out sporadically. The wine list was grabbed away before we had a chance to look at it, without a word. And our waiter felt the need to apologize 13 times, for everything from neglecting to tell us the specials to taking 15 minutes to get the check once we had put down a credit card. The meal took two and a half hours — and not because we were having fun.

The next time we went it was a weeknight, it was not crowded, and the experience could not have been more different. Food was served in a timely, orchestrated way. Water glasses were filled as needed and we heard the specials as soon as we sat down. No need for a single apology.

That made it a lot easier to enjoy the food, and there are some dishes to revel in at Traditions. A special of rigatoni stuffed with ricotta in a creamy tomato sauce was surprisingly light and redolent of fresh basil. Lobster ravioli, which came in a similar sauce with shrimp mixed in, had a delicate taste. The pasta in both dishes was firm but yielding.

As the restaurant’s name implies, the menu offers traditional fare, leaning toward Italian. When it sticks to that mission, it does well. So a New York strip steak was delicious, seasoned just right and cooked with care. A Caesar salad was crisp and nicely dressed, and the strawberry apple salad came topped with gorgonzola, walnuts and an unfussy, tasty strawberry vinaigrette.

But when the kitchen tries too hard, things can go wrong. Coconut-crusted shrimp were big, sweet and not at all greasy — but I’d advise against dipping them in the overly sweet, gelatinous raspberry sauce that accompanies them. Desserts are nearly all gooey messes. Chocolate lava cake had no “lava” and way too much whipped cream. The recommended ice cream crepe, covered in maple syrup, chocolate and raspberry purée and whipped cream, was tough and tasteless. The kitchen should just retire its whipped cream can: nearly all the desserts are covered with it, and none are improved by the practice.
1533 2010-02-21 “I did close my eyes, for a second. For a minute. Not long,” he said. “I kept them open most of the time.”

This is not a comment on the film; it just happens to be the first moment of peace for adults tramping through the city who have to make sure that the kids in their charge do not slip beneath the waves, and for whom the bedlam of a museum food court offers hardly any respite.

New York has pride of place as a world capital for culture and art. That also makes the city a strong contender for world capital of sleeping in public, thanks to the opportunities presented by dozens of theaters, opera and dance companies, and orchestra and chamber music performances. Each one presents a moment of blessed stillness, in the dark.

Normally, museums cannot compete with other venues on the nap front, because 1. the visitors must stand just about the entire time, and 2. the lights are on. All this is true at the American Museum of Natural History and its exhibits on dinosaurs and whales and meteors. Yet it also has a secret weapon: the Hayden Planetarium, with its sky theater and semi-reclining chairs. In surveys by the museum, the planetarium films are among the most frequently cited reasons for a visit.

No one surveys those visitors to see how many nodded off during the movie, but many, many people leaving the theater this week conceded that they had.

“I went down for a minute or two,” said Kevin Vail, who was visiting from Massachusetts with Beth Thompson.

Alas, there is some guilt associated with dozing off during a film that tells all about the origins of everything, everywhere. Ms. Thompson offered mitigating circumstances.

“We are trying to cram a lot into four days,” she said. “We had a late night last night. Plus, we had to stop and get a bite just before we came in. And Whoopi’s voice is like a lullaby, it’s so soothing.

“I was fascinated,” she added. “I didn’t miss any of it.”

The anticipation of coming into the city from Selden, Long Island, had kept Courtney Morelli, 7, and her sister Caitlin, 9, up well past their bedtime. “They were supposed to nap on the train, but they were too worked up,” said their mother, Joanne Morelli.

“We slept during the movie,” said Courtney.

“I kept my eyes open,” said Ms. Morelli. The quality of the film, with its three-dimensional panorama, kept her engaged, she said, but the price of admission — $24 for an adult, and $14 for each child — also made her determined to stay with it to the end. “When I get discount theater tickets, that might be a different story,” she said.

Alan and Anne Dunning, with grandson Griffin, said they, too, had not missed a minute. “I checked on him because he’s usually a candidate for dozing off,” Ms. Dunning said of her husband. “But he didn’t.”

“It was probably the right length,” Mr. Dunning said. “But just get me to the opera.”

Jonathan Dempsey, visiting from Liverpool, explained the hypnotic quality. “You’re lying back and it starts to go black,” he said.

One of his companions, Mike O’Rourke, said he, too, found it relaxing, but had fought back. Not that he hadn’t fallen asleep at his share of movies.

“A few years back, on a first date with a girl, I went right out during ‘Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,’ ” Mr. O’Rourke said. “Suffice to say, there wasn’t a second date.”
1534 2010-02-21 And the benefit for agents is obvious: instead of being on call continuously, they have teammates to provide relief. “If you have strep throat and your doctor is out,” Ms. Blair said, “his partner is there to take care of you.”

Eight years ago, as new agents for Century 21 AA Realty in Lindenhurst, Steve McGrath and Teresa Langan started helping each other out. Their catalyst at the time was the need for Mr. McGrath to attend a wedding out of town. But soon they decided to combine efforts formally, and “share everything,” Mr. McGrath said.

“Weekends you can be in two different places each day,” said Mr. McGrath, who is going 50-50 with Ms. Langan on 10 listings in the $250,000-to-$500,000 range. “If you need to go to a closing, the partner can be doing other work.”

At listing appointments, Ms. Langan leads the conversation, offering a family perspective; Mr. McGrath’s handyman expertise takes precedence when a house needs work.

She is better at getting to know new buyers and negotiations; he has a background in marketing, and is handy at creating brochures and virtual tours. “You have to be good at sharing,” he said.

In the Garden City office of Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty, home of the quad, 18 of the 32 agents operate in teams. “It seems to be a very successful pattern,” said Dougal Fraser, the manager. The setup gives homeowners different personalities to pick from and helps them “see the reality of the current pricing,” he added, pointing out that agents can “be in more places, meet more people and do more business.”

In their previous lives as solo agents, the quad members in the Byrneses’ team recalled, it was often a challenge juggling other obligations. “All four of us have very busy lives,” Ms. Breslin said. In her case, there is travel over spring weekends to watch a college-age son play lacrosse. Ms. Rich and Ms. Blair have four young children apiece. Ms. Donlon spends part of her time building homes in Saratoga, N.Y.

With the group, “we can actually have a life outside of real estate,” said Ms. Breslin, adding, “You know you have three other people with a vested interest in watching your customers and clients.”

Commissions are split four ways, but there is no downside for homeowners, Ms. Donlon said, because they are “getting four for the price of one.”

Since it started, the quad has been involved in 10 transactions, four of them sales of their own listings. Gross sales on these were $14.5 million, including two homes that sold for over $2.8 million each. The group currently has six listings.

“We are all pulling on the same oar,” Ms. Breslin said. “We are all working toward one common goal, and we follow the concept that there is no ‘I’ in team.”

Frank Dell’Accio, the president of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, said that for a team to be effective the right mix of personalities and skills was crucial.

“When the strengths and weaknesses are complementary, it works out very well,” Mr. Dell’Accio said. “On some teams, some people are better on the telephone than others. Some are better with the sellers, and some are better with the buyers.”

When Greg and Kathleen Kennedy listed their Huntington split-level, Donna Spinoso of Daniel Gale held open houses, and her teammate, Phyllis Gelormino, took the couple hunting for a larger home.

A few days ago, less than a month after Ms. Spinoso and Ms. Gelormino secured the listing, the Kennedys’ home went to contract for $611,000.

“They were very professional and gave us a lot of insight, what we needed to do to sell the house,” Mr. Kennedy said, noting that the home had previously been on the market for two years with an individual broker. “They didn’t want to be my friend; they just wanted to sell my house.”

Ms. Spinoso didn’t think she would have been as effective alone.

“If you are an active agent and want to meet the needs of the customer,” she said, “it is great having that other person there.” Together they are able to take out larger advertisements in magazines and promote each home more effectively. They sell about 25 homes a year.
1535 2010-02-21 “I was aware that houses weren’t selling any too quickly, so I took their advice and was pleasantly surprised,” said Ms. Noble-Morrissey, who has lived in the five-bedroom house for 43 years. It went into contract in less than a week. It came on the market on a Wednesday afternoon; by Friday the first bid was proffered; a second followed two days later.

Because the closing has not yet taken place, the brokerage would not reveal the final sales price. But last year, homeowners in Pelham received on average only 91 percent of their asking prices, said Margaret Nicholson, the listing broker, citing sales statistics compiled by the pricing team. “That’s why we decided the time had come for a different approach,” she said.

In the Ossining/Briarcliff market in 2009, homeowners received about 94 percent of their asking prices, according to Mr. Seiden. But he said the actual percentage was probably even lower, as the official one was calculated using the most recent listing price — very likely reduced from the original.

In Larchmont, meanwhile, savvy pricing resulted in the quick sale of a 1950s three-bedroom two-bath colonial. “We wanted buyers to see this as such a good deal that they wouldn’t think they had to wait for the spring market to check out the choices,” said Mark Nadler of Prudential Centennial Realty, which has offices in Larchmont and Scarsdale.

The colonial came on the market in December at $649,000. Mr. Nadler said that figure was influenced by the higher prices of houses on the same street that had had spent nine months or more on the market. A bidding war began within a week, and the house sold for $1,000 over asking.

Mr. Nadler cited another Larchmont example: a three-bedroom two-bath prewar condo listed at $1.2 million whose owners “needed to be convinced” to drop the price. After generating only weak interest and unacceptable offers, they finally agreed to lower the price to $999,000 and then to $985,000. At that point, Mr. Nadler said, “the floodgates opened.” It sold for close to the final asking price, he said.

Larchmont sellers last year ended up with 90 percent of their asking prices, Mr. Nadler said. In Scarsdale the figure was 87 percent — because, he said, brokers there tend to price houses higher.

Price, of course, is not the only variable when selling a house in a down market. “Location, location, location still counts,” said Ms. Nicholson in Pelham, noting that Ms. Noble-Morrissey’s colonial is a block from a Metro-North station and within easy walking distance of the village’s business district.

The first impression also still counts, which is why Richard and Marilyn Wishnie of Briarcliff Manor employed a home stager to help market their four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath 1960s colonial.

“The stager said to us, ‘Come with me to the front door and look at your house the way a buyer might,’ ” recalled Mr. Wishnie, a former county legislator. They did, and subsequently spent $2,500 to remove old wallpaper in the kitchen, replace carpeting in one bedroom and retile the floor in the front entrance.

“She also told us to get rid of the clutter,” Mr. Wishnie said. “We had to realize that what made our home warm for us wasn’t going to sell the house to someone else.”

But it was pricing that may ultimately have turned the tide in their favor. They listed the house at about $619,000 — far less than they had originally hoped — but it sold quickly, for $10,000 over asking. “We knew this was the worst possible time to try and sell a house, but it all worked out,” Mr. Wishnie said.

Given the economy, now may indeed be a less than ideal time to sell. “That’s why we’re seeing a lot of analysis being done for clients by Realtors these days,” said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the listing service.

That a well-priced property will sell more quickly is not a new concept. “That’s true in boom years, too,” Mr. Mercurio said, “although that applies more than ever now.”
1536 2010-02-21 The French critic Jacques Lourcelles has described “Make Way for Tomorrow” as “a masterpiece of the cinema of cruelty, surpassing in its almost unbearable intensity the best works of the greatest specialists in the genre (for example, Buñuel).” But this is a clear-eyed cruelty, without sadism, developed as a controlled stylistic alternative to the unbridled pathos with which the cinema habitually treats the subject of old age.

The very model of classical Hollywood’s “invisible” filmmakers, McCarey doesn’t work through grand gestures and bold compositions, but rather through carefully judged ellipses and unobtrusive metaphors. Structurally, the film is a marvel of efficiency and expressiveness. After the opening scene that lays out the situation, McCarey jumps ahead by several weeks, to find Lucy living tensely with George’s family on Riverside Drive and Bark sleeping on his daughter’s couch in the country. They will not be reunited in the same frame until the film’s final 30 minutes, a crescendo of rising emotion that ends with the couple’s definitive separation.

In New York, Lucy discovers that she “just won’t fit in at all” with her son’s striving, middle-class family, no more than the heavy old rocking chair (with just the right amount of squeak in its springs) that she has brought with her from home. Bark spends his time at a country store, conversing with the proprietor, Mr. Rubens (Maurice Moscovitch), who has had the wisdom to set something aside for old age. McCarey carefully divides his sympathies in these scenes between the parents and their children. Lucy may be loving and responsible, but she is also judgmental and manipulative; the more easygoing Bark carries the comedy here (memorably torturing a young doctor), but without Lucy to manage him, he becomes infantile and helpless. There are no victims or villains, only people touched by circumstance.

Finally the children come up with the excuses needed to get rid of their cumbersome parents. Bark will be sent to California to live with another, never-seen daughter, ostensibly for reasons of health; Lucy will go to an old folks’ home, where she’ll have “friends of her own age.” Bark will have to come to New York to catch the train west, giving them one last day together.

And here, McCarey does something amazing. As the two old people move through Midtown, retracing the course of their honeymoon trip 50 years before, the city seems to blossom for them. In a film so far dominated by petty acts of selfishness, they encounter a series of characters, all strangers (the first is even a car salesman), who treat them with kindness and generosity.

A film defined by close, cramped quarters and, for McCarey, an uncharacteristically restrained use of music, suddenly becomes spatially expansive and filled with melody. When the couple enter the lobby of the grand old hotel where they spent their wedding night, the manager treats them to a cocktail; when they take a spin on the dance floor, the orchestra leader obligingly shifts from a Latin tune to “Let Me Call You Sweetheart.”

When the time comes for their farewell at the station, the moment of grace is over. It has become devastatingly clear that no Hollywood miracle is going to occur, and Bark and Lucy say goodbye, holding back their feelings in hope of sparing each other. McCarey moves in for a medium close-up of Lucy as she watches Bark’s train pull away, and the range of emotion that crosses her face, during this extended, wordless take, defies written description. Lucy looks down, up, and down again; the train, which we’ve seen moving in the soft-focus background behind her, is gone, leaving only an empty stillness. She turns, and starts to walk out of the frame.

And that is why I love the movies.

1537 2010-02-21 In revisiting Christopher Lasch’s “Culture of Narcissism” (“The Book of Self-Love,” Feb. 7), Lee Siegel missed the opportunity to critically appraise a work that was unfortunately allowed to pass as both prophetic and profound at the time of its publication. While some critics complained about its being a “hellfire sermon,” there was little if any clarification from the psychoanalytic community regarding Lasch’s misuse of Freud’s concept of narcissism. Lasch chose that concept because it served his purpose: to denounce our culture, and particularly to express his unhappiness and rage at its increasing orientation toward individual self-­actualization rather than obligation to others — a shift that, in his view, weakened the bonds of family and community.

Lasch’s position was based on his stance against cultural progressivism and his deeply held dislike of experts like psychotherapists who indeed dedicated themselves to working with individual patients to free them from neurotic guilt and shame. Freud and psychoanalysts who have followed his approach defined narcissism in technical terms that related to the original libido theory present in the early days of psychoanalysis; the term in no way was meant to carry the pejorative implication that Lasch assigned to it.

Siegel’s apparent endorsement of Lasch gives him far more credit than he deserves for a position that is more pseudo-psychological and personal than it is profound. Siegel says that “passionate excess is often the price of original perception,” granting Lasch a position of creativity that he hardly earned then or now. When he concludes his essay with the statement that “the personality of his time, it seems, is even more the personality of ours,” he perpetuates the myth that Lasch was a social critic to be taken seriously rather than a curmudgeon expressing a personal dislike of and disdain for a society that approved of increased personal freedom.

As a footnote to Lee Siegel’s fine essay, I should like to mention that Mexico’s great poet, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, in her auto sacramental “The Divine Narcissus,” leads us to deduce that God himself is a narcissist. Else, after creating man in his own image, why did he then proceed to fall in love with it? Let the creationists ponder that one.
1538 2010-02-21 It was nice to read your very astute article regarding the inimitable British guitar virtuoso Jeff Beck. His boundless talent and fretboard virtuosity have enabled him to master hard rock, jazz fusion, blues, funk and electronica musical genres. His solo live concert performances are equally spellbinding and evocative. His fingers seem to be hard-wired to his heart and soul.

He’s arguably the greatest guitarist to ever grace the planet, while he’s also inarguably the most overlooked guitar icon.
1539 2010-02-21 “What’s fascinating about Yun-Fei is that he would turn to radical antiquarianism, when the society he’s from really hates that,” said May Castleberry, an editor for the Museum of Modern Art’s Library Council Editions, which recently published a limited-edition book of his new work.

During a recent interview at his New York gallery, Mr. Ji agreed. “When I was growing up during the Cultural Revolution,” he said, “if you were a traditional landscape painter, you could really get in trouble.”

During subsequent decades, as Chinese artists gravitated toward Western approaches to art, “again traditional painting was not fashionable,” he said. In the past couple of years, however, “people in China have become more interested in looking at these traditions,” he said.

In “Migrants of the Three Gorges Dam,” a project that Mr. Ji began several years ago under the auspices of MoMA, he once again uses traditional means to explore contemporary issues. Hand printed from 500 carved woodblocks made by the esteemed Rongbaozhai printing and publishing house, Mr. Ji’s mounted scroll portrays flooded landscapes and dispossessed farmers alongside his calligraphic descriptions of the flooding of the Yangtze River and reports on the displacement of inhabitants of the area based on his own interviews, research and observations.

Yet Mr. Ji said he was less interested in criticizing the world’s largest hydroelectric power plant — long a symbol of progress in China — than he was in revealing the interconnection between humans and their natural environment. “The belief among ancient scholars,” he said, “is that nature offers an ethical model that we should follow in human society. A horizontal line, for example, in Chinese calligraphy, is like a cloud formation, or a natural, living form.”

Having just arrived in New York this month after an eight-month stay in China, Mr. Ji, whose brown tweed cap was offset by a V-neck sweater and sensible sneakers, unrolled a bundle of new paintings, which he had carried on the airplane. One of these, “The Garden Party,” reflected his recent musings on Sade’s work. An apparently bucolic scene based on a recent visit to the ancient gardens of Suzhou, the watercolor contrasts overflowing flowerpots and blooming cherry trees with decadent-looking figures in various stages of dress. Among them a naked figure crawls on all fours through a puddle with a bag over his head and his pants bunched around his ankles. Framing the image are excerpts from Sade’s text rendered into Mr. Ji’s elegant calligraphy. Offering a rough translation, he read: “Your duty is to serve my pleasure, and to take a lot of abuse. If you complain, you’ll be destroyed.”

Reading further, in silence, Mr. Ji, a soft-spoken man with a wry sense of humor, chuckled. “The writing is very vulgar,” he said.

He spent his early childhood at an army base, where his father served as a military doctor. He was 7, he said, when his mother, a draftswoman in an architectural firm, was sent for re-education in a labor camp. “I don’t know what she did,” he said.

During her two-year absence Mr. Ji lived with his grandparents in Hangzhou, which from 1127 to 1279 was the ancient capital city of the southern Song Dynasty. There his grandfather, who taught high school, introduced him to calligraphy. And on hot summer nights, since “we didn’t have a TV or even a radio,” Mr. Ji said, his grandmother would sit outside among their neighbors “sipping a tea and telling ghost stories.” Drowned ghosts, hoping to reincarnate themselves by inhabiting the bodies of living children, figured repeatedly in his grandmother’s many stories. And they clearly struck a nerve; Mr. Ji’s landscapes are often strewn with fantastical chimeras, ghostlike figures with animal bodies and heads.

Mr. Ji attended the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where most of his teachers had been trained at Stalinist art schools in the Soviet Union during the 1950s. Not surprisingly, social realism was the reigning style. Although classical art was dismissed as backward, Mr. Ji said Chung Jun Quai, a costume and lighting designer for films, taught him “that reading a painting is like reading a poem.”

When the University of Arkansas offered Mr. Ji a scholarship in 1986, he said, the decision to leave China was difficult: “There was a lot of excitement when I was in art school. But I also felt this pressure that was really restrictive. Psychologically, it felt very uncomfortable.”

Once in the United States, however, he discovered the German Expressionists George Grosz and Otto Dix, and the American postwar painter Philip Guston, who combined humorous, even cartoony iconography with masterly painting. Remaining in America after he graduated, Mr. Ji was eventually granted citizenship and moved to Brooklyn. Even so, depictions of his native China continue to dominate his work. Referring to “a huge corruption scandal” unfolding in the city of Chongqing during his recent visit, Mr. Ji asked, “What do you do when so much control and power is concentrated in the hands of a few corrupt officials?”

Without waiting for an answer, he added, “That’s why the Marquis de Sade made sense to me as a kind of response.”
1540 2010-02-21 After two sold-out runs in Britain “Enron” begin previews on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theater on April 8. In Britain Ms. Prebble, now 29, was hailed for creating an accessible story about the company despite the forbidding complexity of its financial machinations.

“She managed to demystify a lot of technical terms,” said Nick Mooney, who held senior positions at Enron for around nine years, mostly in London. “It brought a dry subject to life.”

The play traces Enron’s rise, from its heady early days with Kenneth L. Lay as its avuncular founder and Jeffrey K. Skilling as a seductive division head who eventually became chief executive, to its demise when various schemes by the chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, and others to disguise the company’s massive debts unraveled.

Although “Enron” is interspersed with a handful of songs and dances, Ms. Prebble calls it a play rather than a musical. “I originally envisioned the show as having a few numbers, but I think it was taking it into quite a superficial place, in the sense that if you have more numbers, there’s less time for narrative,” she said.

As a result some of the songs were cut. And figurative elements help to make sense of arcane financial transactions, like three prowling, red-eyed velociraptors that represent structures for hiding debt.

Ms. Prebble said that she tried to avoid a preachy or self-righteous tone and that the play is intended to be a view “from inside the bubble.” One ethereal song celebrates the exhilaration of trading and the beauty of commodities like aluminum and gold.

“We’re not interested in taking the standard liberal line,” said Rupert Goold, the director. “We’re trying to be interested in the glamour.”

At the pub Ms. Prebble wore a cheerful green dress with polka dots and was sunny and self-deprecating. After letting slip her original payment for “Enron” — £6,000 (about $9,400 at current exchange rates), and a small percentage of ticket receipts — she exclaimed, “That’s ever so gauche of me, isn’t it?”

Ms. Prebble is often drawn to topics that seem veiled and unexamined, she said, like the urges of pedophiles or the psychology of people in commerce. To set them down in words is to gain a handle on them.

“Mostly what you write is an exploration of something that you’re interested in but can’t quite articulate in any other way,” she said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s born of some great psychological trauma, but there’s some little wound that you’re picking at.”

With “Enron,” two inchoate bundles of ideas intrigued her. One, how culpable we are for the actions of companies we work for and deal with. And two, how intelligence and goodness are intertwined, or not. “I feel uncomfortable about the fact that intelligence isn’t really related to goodness at all,” she said.

For a year Ms. Prebble stockpiled information on Enron: court transcripts, interviews and articles from The Houston Chronicle’s Web site. She interviewed people who worked at or with Enron. Anything that seemed especially interesting went into a sort of scrapbook. Writing and rewriting ate up another two years. The play was first staged last summer at the theater festival in Chichester, England.

While the Enron scandal can seem dauntingly complicated, she said a family background in business made her feel less intimidated. Her father was a director at a software company, and her brother and sister both work at the accounting firm Accenture, though Ms. Prebble said that neither was at the firm when it was a unit of Arthur Anderson, which failed in the Enron scandal.

Storytelling has long featured in Ms. Prebble’s life. She had a middle-class upbringing in Surrey, and as a child regaled trees in her garden with fairy tales. Teenage poetry followed (and still causes her to cringe). She became involved in drama at Sheffield, where she fell in with a group of students who wanted to stage a new play. She had a crush on one of the men, and in a show of bravura volunteered to write it.

That play, “Liquid,” now leaves her cold, but its topic — young professionals forging corporate careers in the corporate sector — was prescient. As for the boyfriend, they eventually broke up.

Her first success was “The Sugar Syndrome,” which had its premiere in 2003 and told of the relationship between a pedophile and a 17-year-old girl with eating disorders who meet in an Internet chat room. As she researched the story, Ms. Prebble contacted convicted pedophiles through a professional. By e-mail she asked them how their desires came to be, and what they thought society should do with them.

The play won awards from the Theatrical Management Association and the Critics’ Circle in London. “At the time I thought I was doing something quite interesting by trying to express a bit of humanity for someone who’s done something quite terrible,” she said, adding that her play now feels less original.

A fallow, difficult period followed. A theater commissioned a play about pornography, then rejected it, rocking her confidence. She took secretarial jobs. Careers in the legal profession seemed increasingly alluring. In the end she focused her efforts on television.

In 2005 she began adapting a blog by a London call girl who went by the pseudonym Belle de Jour. (In November, Brooke Magnanti, a scientist at Bristol University, said she was the author.) Critics were not enamored of the show, “Secret Diary of a Call Girl,” with The Guardian labeling it “shallow and a bit silly.”

Ms. Prebble no longer works on it, and said that her departure was not acrimonious, but that the format was limiting: “I wanted to do something I had control over.”

Today she refers to “Secret Diary” as a learning experience. “Sex, for example, has a really loud volume on screen, which I didn’t quite anticipate,” she said. Plot points that she had hoped would be subtle “were completely obscured” by the sound of actors having sex.

On the back of “Enron,” offers of work have flooded in, Ms. Prebble said. She is producing a screenplay for a film version of “Enron,” which is being made by Sony.

“I’m very keen that it shouldn’t be a dry, biopic version,” she said. “It should retain the surreal and fantastical elements.”

Income from the play has allowed her to pay off her student loan. And “Enron” recently picked up six Laurence Olivier Award nominations in London. But as Broadway looms, her nerves are jangling, and she wonders how audiences will react to an American story told by a British dramatist.

Ultimately, though, she knows that this uncertainty is the writer’s lot.

“It’s a really odd journey, from being completely in control of something that you’ve created to something that is utterly free,” she said. “People come to see it and decide for themselves, and you can’t control that at all.”

1545 2010-02-22 Ilona Copen, a founder of the New York International Ballet Competition and a champion of the exchange of ideas among dance companies around the world, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.

The cause was cancer, said her husband, James A. Goldstein.

Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Copen studied dance at the Juilliard School and performed with small modern-dance companies directed by Myra Kinch, Shirley Broughton, Katherine Litz and Jeff Duncan, among other choreographers. Yet her ambition to be a modern dancer was soon eclipsed by a desire to promote dance as a global art.

In 1983 she and Igor Youskevitch, a distinguished premier danseur who had starred with both American Ballet Theater and the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, established the New York International Ballet Competition, which held its first event the next year and has since become a biennial attraction.

Although there have long been worldwide ballet competitions, the New York one was unusual from the outset because of the way Ms. Copen and Mr. Youskevitch sought to make its young participants, between 17 and 24, feel like colleagues, rather than cut-throat rivals. They also introduced an unusual system. Whereas at some competitions, participants can dance what they wish in whatever choreographic version they choose, the New York competition repertory is never announced until after the dancers have arrived in New York. Then they are taught the same three pas de deux, which they must perform in exactly the same versions, thereby allowing a panel of judges to appraise them without having to take into account any personal or choreographic idiosyncrasies.

Ms. Copen was the competition’s executive director and Mr. Youskevitch its artistic director until his death, in 1994, after which Ms. Copen continued on as executive director. She retired last July.

1566 2010-02-22 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has changed the blueprint of his affordable housing plan to preserve more such homes but build fewer of them, a shift that nonetheless will still cost the city $1 billion more than originally anticipated.

The revamped New Housing Marketplace Plan, as the initiative is called, will now cost $8.5 billion to create or preserve 165,000 affordable homes by 2014, city officials said. Most of the extra funds will come from the city’s Housing Development Corporation, which issues bonds for the housing.

The city plans to ensure that an additional 32,000 units stay affordable for the next 30 years or so, protecting vulnerable lower-income New Yorkers from the next housing boom. In 2005, the city said it would build 92,000 units and preserve 73,000 by 2014. Now, it expects to build 60,000 and preserve 105,000.

The city’s definition of preserving affordable apartments means that its housing agencies refinance and renovate buildings in return for keeping rents locked in for long periods, usually decades, as opposed to letting the units rent or sell at market rates.

Most of the affordable units that the city plans to concentrate on will be occupied by New Yorkers who earn less than 80 percent of the area’s median income. Affordability means that 30 percent or less of their wages would go to rent. Rafael E. Cestero, the city’s housing commissioner, said that mortgages of many of the affordable rental buildings built in the 1980s were coming due, giving the city a chance to issue new ones with long-term affordability as a condition.
1567 2010-02-22 “This is my daughter, I love her and I know she’s not a murderer,” Daniel Walsh, Ms. Lowery’s stepfather, said recently, explaining why the family had been so passionate during the trial. Mr. Walsh had to be led out of the courtroom after he shouted down the judge, Justice Richard D. Carruthers, for not letting Ms. Lowery replace her lawyers midway through the trial.

Ms. Stein’s daughters declined to comment for this article. But two friends who have talked to them recently said they seemed to be holding up well. Danny Fields, who co-managed the Ramones with Ms. Stein, said he saw this firsthand last week when he spoke with Ms. Stein’s daughters while they were sitting shiva for their grandfather, Ira Adler, who died a little more than a week ago.

“More than holding up, they were commanding the room, they were greeting and introducing,” Mr. Fields said. “Linda would have been so proud.”

Summations are scheduled for Monday, after which it will be up to the jury to decide whether Ms. Lowery was guilty of bludgeoning Ms. Stein, who was found dead in her Upper East Side apartment in late October 2007.

The apparent tensions between the Stein and Lowery families first arose in 2007, when, after a bail hearing, members of Ms. Lowery’s family accused Mandy Stein of killing her own mother.

Jitters have also been apparent during the trial. After Mr. Walsh’s outburst over Justice Carruthers’s ruling on Ms. Lowery’s lawyers, a reporter tapped Mandy Stein in court to ask her a question. Startled, Ms. Stein jumped, began to shake and turned red in the face.

“We don’t have no problem with the family,” Mr. Walsh said. “We just want the statements that they told the police to be examined.”

Mr. Walsh pointed to a statement that Samantha Stein-Wells had given the police shortly after her mother was killed; the statement suggested that her husband might be someone to investigate.

Thomas Giovanni, one of Ms. Lowery’s lawyers, asked Mandy Stein whether she at one point suspected her brother-in-law in the murder. Justice Carruthers did not allow the question.

Mr. Fields said that although Ms. Stein’s daughters may have gotten into arguments with her, it was laughable to suggest that they had anything to do with her murder.

One of the most startling pieces of evidence from the trial has not yet been discussed in court.

A close look at surveillance footage from Ms. Stein’s apartment building the day she was killed shows that when Ms. Lowery left, her cargo pants looked different from how they did when she entered. On the way in, large side pockets are visible. On the way out, the pockets are gone and vertical seams are visible, suggesting the pants may have been turned inside out.

The defense has argued that if Ms. Lowery killed Ms. Stein, she would have gotten blood on her pants and it would have been visible in the video. But the prosecution is expected to highlight the discrepancy in the pants, first noted publicly on a blog, goodblogstay, suggesting that Ms. Lowery turned her pants inside out to conceal the blood.

Last week, Justice Carruthers granted the defense’s request to allow the jury to consider first-degree manslaughter in addition to second-degree murder, the top charge that Ms. Lowery faces. It is common for defense lawyers to ask that a lesser charge be included.

This means that if jurors find that Ms. Lowery did indeed kill Ms. Stein, but was not trying to, they could convict her of manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. A murder conviction would mean that Ms. Lowery could get a life sentence.
1568 2010-02-22 President Obama’s call last month for fundamental changes in the mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration seemed to open the door, or roof, ever wider to private industry. Some people here interpreted his words to mean that your seat back and tray table should be in their full upright positions, because commercial space travel is about to blast off.

And this flat, deserted, mostly rain-free stretch of New Mexico is the perfect location, says Will Whitehorn, the president of Virgin Galactic, the spaceport’s anchor tenant. “It is about the closest you get on planet Earth to a Martian landscape,” he says .

Southern New Mexico has long held claim to the skies, thanks in part to pioneers with local ties, like Robert Goddard, a father of modern rocketry; J. P. Stapp, a leader in aerospace safety; and Ham, the space chimp.

You might also include Gary Whitehead, 43, affable car salesman from Truth or Consequences, though not because his family’s dealership was once owned by the former astronaut Frank Borman. Mr. Whitehead, a longtime public servant, has been championing a spaceport in New Mexico since 1994.

Back then he was a freshly elected member of the Sierra County Commission, captivated by an entity that had been created by various visionaries and politicians. Its understated name: the Southwest Regional Space Task Force. Its over-the-top goal: to have a spaceport built in southwestern New Mexico one day.

Mr. Whitehead wanted in, so he created a space task force for Sierra County. Word soon spread that if you wanted a deal on a car, or information about the economic possibilities of the great beyond, Gary Whitehead was the man to see.

Few people in Truth or Consequences dismissed the spaceport plan as “crazy Buck Rogers stuff,” Mr. Whitehead recalls. Then again, this is the sleepy spa city that, in 1950, changed its name from Hot Springs because Ralph Edwards, the host of “Truth or Consequences,” promised to broadcast from the first town to adopt his radio show’s name.

The concept of a spaceport remained just that for many years, even though it seemed to make perfect sense. An 18,000-acre stretch of the Cain family ranch was an ideal location for a spaceport. The restricted airspace of the White Sands Missile Range meant uncluttered skies for launchings. And with the high elevation, you could argue that a space launching’s first mile was free.

Finally, about five years ago, things began to click. Since then, New Mexico has added the spaceport to its economic development plan; Virgin Galactic, the commercial space travel business of the British billionaire Richard Branson, has signed a 20-year lease; construction has begun; and 326 people have placed reservations for their trip to suborbital space. Virgin Galactic says it has received $44 million in deposits so far.

What’s more, most residents here seem open to the idea. Two of three local counties have voted to support a sales tax to help pay for the space project, including Sierra County, where Mr. Whitehead was a co-chairman of a lobbying campaign called People for Aerospace.

By now, Spaceport America has been part of the local conversation for so long that it stirs about as much excitement as a new Applebee’s. Last year, for example, The Las Cruces Sun-News published a headline that read: “Spaceport, Animal Shelter Board Members Chosen.”

Mr. Whitehead, though, has gone from ho-hum to wow. At first he saw the project merely as a way to lift the local economy, he says. But as the project took shape, he felt awe. “It became, ‘Gee whiz,’ ” he says.

Mr. Whitehead, who was recently appointed to the state’s Spaceport Authority, which is overseeing the project, checks in at the village of construction trailers that have cropped up amid the desert brush. Accompanied by Dave Wilson, a marketing consultant, he leads a quick hardhat tour, past signs that say “Caution: Equipment Crossing” and “Authorized Launch Personnel Only.”

Right here, where the ground is being cleared, or “grubbed,” will be the 110,000-square-foot Terminal Hangar Facility, which will also include administrative offices. And here, close to the unfolding ribbon of runway, is where a groundbreaking ceremony in June featured actors dressed as Old World explorers and dignitaries discussing the New World discovery of the heavens.

And here, not far from the home of a ranch hand, is the Vertical Launch Facility, where several space vessels have been shot into the sky. One, in 2007, contained some of the cremated remains of dozens of people, including the astronaut Gordon Cooper and James Doohan, who played Scotty in “Star Trek.”

Of course, the hope is to send people, not ashes, into space. This could — could — happen as early as 2011, although Virgin Galactic says that it is concentrating first on matters of licensing and, especially, safety.

Still. Imagine. A mothership named Eve zooms off the runway and 50,000 feet into the sky, where it releases a smaller spaceship, the Enterprise, that rockets higher still. High enough for the two pilots and six paying customers to see the curvature of the Earth, and hear the silence of space.

Imagining this is not difficult for Mr. Whitehead. His problem, he says, is convincing people that “there’s more to this than rich people flying to space.” These customers, he says, will effectively be underwriting the possibility for space research, space education and all sorts of “space-related businesses.”

The tour ends, and is followed by a long trip back to Truth or Consequences, where the lot at Whitehead Chevrolet is filled with earthbound vessels, new and used. But the artwork on display inside — Van Gogh’s mysterious night skies — reflects the starry, starry dreams of a car dealer in a place known to accept dares.
1569 2010-02-22 With the iTunes pricing debate, the television industry is facing the same question that music labels and publishers are: just how much is our content worth in a digital world?

It is especially complicated for TV, given that most people already pay for TV through their cable or satellite service — and they can watch most network shows free on streaming sites like Hulu, albeit with advertisements.

The notion of selling individual TV episodes straight to the consumer is still a relatively new one. Apple added video to its music store in late 2005 and sold episodes of the ABC shows “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives” without ads for $1.99, twice the price of a single song at the time.

The store soon expanded to include virtually all of the major TV providers, with Apple insisting on a uniform $1.99 price for episodes. NBC Universal bristled and removed its shows at the end of 2007 but returned nine months later, after Apple slightly relaxed its pricing structure.

For the most part, though, standard-definition episodes from NBC and other networks remain $1.99, and high-definition episodes are $2.99, whether it is a brand-new hourlong drama or a five-year-old half-hour sitcom. Movie sales and rentals are more flexible.

But iTunes remains, predominately, a music store. Consumers have downloaded nearly 10 billion songs and about 375 million TV episodes.

Analysts say the TV revenue from iTunes has been marginal for producers and distributors.

“It’s still a niche portion of the marketplace,” said Doug Mitchelson, a television analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities, who characterized iTunes and competing digital stores as an extension of DVD sales of TV shows.

Separately, Apple has proposed to some networks that the store sell a subscription package of popular TV shows. At a price some reports have set at $30 a month, the subscription service would be a direct threat to entrenched cable and satellite providers. Apple has encountered trepidation from some networks, but the proposal is not off the table, according to executives at two of the networks.

What would make the iTunes sales more significant? That is where pricing science comes in. In conversations with networks, Apple representatives have cited 99 cents as the magic price point that brought digital music sales into the mainstream. The company says the same price could propel TV sales, according to the network executives. But the networks have little data about what effect 99-cent sales would have, making them more apprehensive about a change.

“If you took five things at Wal-Mart and sold them for a nickel, they’d sell really well, because they’d stand out. But if you took everything in the store and made it a nickel, nothing stands out anymore. Essentially all you’ve done is lowered the value of your content,” said a senior executive at a TV network owner.

Most other media companies declined to comment on TV pricing at iTunes last week, as did a spokesman for Apple.

Pricing is coming up now in part because Apple is keen — some TV executives privately say desperate — to line up content for the iPad, the tablet computer to be available in March.

Mr. Mitchelson said prices under a dollar were “very appealing to the consumer,” and he said the key for Apple was, “Can you draw in this huge swath of folks who aren’t using iTunes at all to purchase TV shows?”

The networks appear willing to try lower prices in a limited way. The Financial Times reported this month that some networks had agreed to a test of lower prices, but it did not name any.

Asked about iTunes on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Corporation, said that “certain shows” would be sold for 99 cents, but “I don’t know yet which will be.” People in the industry doubt the discounts would apply to the newest episodes of marquee shows like “NCIS” or “Two and a Half Men.” A CBS spokesman said Friday that no new deal with Apple was imminent.

Among the few 99-cent TV shows on iTunes last week were NBC recaps of Olympic events and episodes of the PBS Kids shows “Arthur,” “Martha Speaks” and “WordGirl.”

The PBS pricing is temporary. Andrew Russell, a senior vice president of the service, called it a three-week experiment to “generate buzz.”

“At this point we still feel the $1.99 price point is right for us, our audiences and our producers to help support creation of more outstanding kids’ content,” Mr. Russell said by e-mail. “But we’ll remain flexible in this fast-changing environment.”
1570 2010-02-22 O.K., the beast is starving. Now what? That’s the question confronting Republicans. But they’re refusing to answer, or even to engage in any serious discussion about what to do.

For readers who don’t know what I’m talking about: ever since Reagan, the has been run by people who want a much smaller government. In the famous words of the activist , conservatives want to get the government “down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.”

But there has always been a political problem with this agenda. Voters may say that they oppose big government, but the programs that actually dominate federal spending — , and — are very popular. So how can the public be persuaded to accept large spending cuts?

The conservative answer, which evolved in the late 1970s, would be dubbed “starving the beast” during the Reagan years. The idea — propounded by many members of the conservative intelligentsia, from to — was basically that sympathetic politicians should engage in a game of bait and switch. Rather than proposing unpopular spending cuts, Republicans would push through popular cuts, with the deliberate intention of worsening the government’s fiscal position. Spending cuts could then be sold as a necessity rather than a choice, the only way to eliminate an unsustainable budget deficit.

And the deficit came. True, more than half of this year’s budget deficit is the result of the Great Recession, which has both depressed revenues and required a temporary surge in spending to contain the damage. But even when the crisis is over, the budget will remain deeply in the red, largely as a result of Bush-era tax cuts (and Bush-era unfunded wars). And the combination of an aging population and rising medical costs will, unless something is done, lead to explosive debt growth after 2020.

So the beast is starving, as planned. It should be time, then, for conservatives to explain which parts of the beast they want to cut. And has, in effect, invited them to do just that, by calling for a bipartisan deficit commission.
1571 2010-02-22 Victims of employment discrimination are increasingly finding the courthouse door closed, as conservative judges twist the law to throw out civil rights suits on technicalities. The Supreme Court hears arguments Monday in a discrimination case that African-American applicants to the Chicago Fire Department won on the merits only to have the suit thrown out on the ground that they had complained too late.

Chicago administered a test for firefighters in a way that discriminated against blacks. Instead of designating anyone scoring above 65 — the passing grade — as “qualified,” it adopted a second benchmark of 89 and decided to hire only from this “well qualified” category.

The department was not able to show that doing so produced firefighters who performed appreciably better. But the higher benchmark meant that white applicants were five times more likely than African-Americans to move on to the next stage of the hiring process.

A group of African-American applicants designated as “qualified” filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and then sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The Federal District Court ruled that the city’s hiring practices had discriminated against them.

On appeal, the Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ruling that the applicants had not filed with the E.E.O.C. within the 300-day time limit set by federal law.
1572 2010-02-22 KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — The shuttle Endeavour arrived home late Sunday, dropping out of a partly cloudy night sky to a smooth touchdown, leaving the International Space Station behind in orbit with a new life support module and a bay window observation deck.

Descending at a 21-degree angle after a 5,000-mile glide from space, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marines pulled up the shuttle’s nose and Col. Terry W. Virts Jr. of the Air Force, the pilot, deployed the ship’s landing gear. The Endeavour touched down on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center at 10:20 p.m. Eastern time.

A few minutes later, the craft rolled to a stop on the runway’s centerline, ending a two-week mission spanning 217 orbits since blastoff on Feb. 8.

“Roger, wheels stopped, Endeavour. Welcome home. Congratulations to you and the crew on an outstanding mission, installing the Tranquility node and opening up the cupola’s windows to the world,” Rick Sturckow, an astronaut, replied from Houston.

The Endeavour crew — Colonel Zamka; Colonel Virts; the flight engineer, Stephen K. Robinson; Kathryn P. Hire, a captain in the Navy Reserve; and the two spacewalkers, Nicholas J. M. Patrick and Lt. Col. Robert L. Behnken of the Air Force — planned to fly back to Texas on Monday after reunions with friends and family.
1573 2010-02-22 Prodded by a national commitment to improve public transportation for soccer’s 2010 World Cup, Johannesburg is carrying out the nation’s most ambitious program. The city predicted that buses would be rolling from Soweto, where a quarter of the city’s four million residents live, to Sandton, the region’s commercial and financial hub, by June.

But its bus project is falling short of that goal and has also become a reminder of just how challenging it is for South Africa to transcend its scarred history. Beyond the usual logistical delays and a recession-related slowdown in financing, the project has confronted resistance from both suburbanites in what were once exclusively white enclaves and from some in the black-owned minibus taxi industry that sprang up during apartheid.

Rehana Moosajee, the City Council member who leads Johannesburg’s Transportation Department, ruefully acknowledged that the buses would not reach Sandton before the current city administration’s term expired next year, and she offered no certain prediction about when they would make it there.

“The transport system tells a very big story of the psyche of the nation,” she said, explaining that the country still had a long way to go in bridging racial and class divides.

The city’s first challenge was to win over the formidable minibus taxi industry, which moves 14 million people daily in a nation of 49 million, far more than the bus and rail systems combined. It is perhaps the country’s greatest success story of black entrepreneurship, though with a history of ruthless violence. Experts estimate that hundreds, if not thousands, of people have died in “taxi wars” to control routes.

The city has sought to get the industry involved by offering taxi proprietors ownership of the bus operating company, but negotiations have dragged on, and some in the industry remain fiercely opposed.

After the bus line began running five months ago, along a 16-mile route from Soweto to the central business district, a bus was fired on and a passenger and a policewoman on it were hit. Gunmen shot at the home of Mrs. Moosajee, hitting her security guard in the neck. And Vananda Khumalo, a taxi industry official and advocate for a deal with the city, was killed. There have been no arrests, Mrs. Moosajee said.

The city has also faced steely opposition from suburbanites that some officials describe as a classic case of not-in-my-backyard resistance. At a packed meeting in November 2008, residents from the strand of stately, still mostly white communities along the heavily traveled Oxford Road shouted down city officials who were trying to describe proposed bus routes, including one that would use two of Oxford Road’s four lanes for buses.

“They just stood up and said, ‘No, no, no, no!’ ” recalled Tessa Turvey, a resident married to a mining industry entrepreneur. Mrs. Turvey has since honed a message in defense of her neighborhood, Saxonwold, where jacaranda trees arch over tranquil streets and homes are adorned with rose gardens, swimming pools and lush greenswards.

In a letter to the city, the neighborhood association’s members welcomed a mass transit system but opposed what they considered hastily and ill-conceived routes that they said would pollute the air, cause traffic to spill onto side streets, increase crime and damage property values.

Already, residents are raising money for legal battles.

“We do have individuals in the suburb who would be willing to pay anything to protect it,” Mrs. Turvey said.

Mrs. Turvey, who is white, was dismissive of those who contended that the suburbs were guarding white privilege, noting that much of the black political elite, including Nelson Mandela, now lived in these same neighborhoods. “This is not a race issue,” she said indignantly.

But Shireen Ally, a sociologist at the University of the Witwatersrand and a resident of Killarney, one of the affected suburbs, said race had everything to do with the suburbs’ reaction. At the raucous 2008 meeting, Ms. Ally said she grew angry as resident after resident in the overwhelmingly white audience said the bus project would damage their property values. Ms. Ally, who grew up in Lenasia, a township south of Soweto for Indians, chided residents with cars for not considering the needs of people dependent on public transport.

One in six working women in South Africa is a housekeeper or nanny. Families in the northern suburbs depend on these women, the overwhelming majority of them black, to iron their clothes and clean their toilets. Ms. Ally, who wrote her dissertation on domestic workers, said she was disturbed by “the incapacity of these suburbanites to think about it from the perspective of the women they trust their children and home to, the women they call part of the family.”

Shortly after 5 a.m., while the suburbs slumbered, Mrs. Hanong stepped out from her small, tidy home in Soweto, a pocketbook dangling from her arm, bound for the housekeeping job she has held for a quarter century. She kissed her 14-year-old nephew, Jabu, goodbye. She has cared for him since his father, a taxi driver in Durban, was killed in the industry violence there.

Taxis were already cruising the streets. Their headlights illuminated the tide of people flowing to bus and taxi stops.

Just months earlier, Mrs. Hanong, who has never learned to read, was still catching taxis close to home. But her preference for the new buses is so strong that she walks an extra half hour to reach them. They cost about 65 cents each way, a savings of about 50 cents over taxi fare, a considerable sum, given her earnings of $160 a month.

Even so, she has to transfer to a taxi to get to Sandton. Transportation still gobbles up a fifth of her salary.

On the new Brazilian-made bus, Mrs. Hanong gazed out the window as it rumbled through Soweto, past Soccer City, the World Cup stadium, then deeper into the apartheid era’s “buffer zone” of mine dumps, factories and undeveloped land that separated blacks from whites.

Once downtown, she walked to the vast, grimy minibus depot. Her taxi barreled down Twist Street, pedestrians scattering ahead of it as it accelerated to the rhythm of Zulu pop. Battalions of taxis joined the luxury cars on the highway into the suburbs.

Two hours after she left home, Mrs. Hanong stepped down in Sandton and headed to the townhouse of her employer, who works in a real estate office.

There, she shed her tan dress to reveal a baby blue uniform. She stripped the bedsheets, loaded the washing machine and put the dishes away with a soft clatter. When her boss’s white cat trotted into the kitchen, Mrs. Hanong pleasantly asked him, “Why not have your breakfast?”
1574 2010-02-22 But those with knowledge of the investigation say there are reliable clues that suggest the highly sophisticated attacks may have originated at Jiaotong and the more obscure campus, Lanxiang Vocational School in Shandong Province, an institution with ties to the Chinese military.

Last weekend, the two schools strongly denied any knowledge of the attacks, which singled out corporate files and the e-mail accounts of human rights activists.

A spokesman for Jiaotong told local news outlets that school officials were “shocked and indignant” to learn of the allegations. And a Lanxiang spokesman called the reports preposterous.

But analysts say Jiaotong and Lanxiang are certain to come under close scrutiny.

Jiaotong is one of China’s top universities, and one charged with helping transform this country into a science and technology powerhouse.

The school has exchange programs with some of the world’s leading universities. Early this year, Duke said that with the help of Jiaotong, it would build its own campus near Shanghai.

Michael J. Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke, said on Friday that the university was troubled by the allegations.

“We’re going to have to explore that with Shanghai Jiaotong and understand the situation,” he said. “It’s a very complex situation.”

One of Jiaotong’s strongest departments is computer science, which has garnered support from some of America’s biggest technology companies, including Cisco Systems. Microsoft has collaborated with Jiaotong on a laboratory for intelligent computing and intelligent systems at the university.

Two weeks ago, Jiaotong students won an international computer programming competition sponsored by I.B.M., known as the Battle of the Brains, beating out Stanford and other elite institutions. It was the third time in the last decade that Jiaotong students had taken the top prize.

Jiaotong is also home to the School of Information Security Engineering, which specializes in Internet security. The school’s dean and chief professor have both worked on technology matters for the People’s Liberation Army, according to the school’s Web site.

The school, which has received financing from a high-level government science and technology project, code-named 863, has also regularly invited world-famous hackers and Web security experts to lecture there.

The latest clues do not answer the question of who was behind the attacks. But it is likely to put added pressure on Beijing to investigate a case that has prompted Google to threaten to pull out of China.

Beijing has not announced an investigation, but Web security experts emphasize that the Chinese government would need to be involved to find the ultimate perpetrators of the attacks.

“The U.S. would not be able to trace this” back to the source, said O. Sami Saydjari, the founder of the Cyber Defense Agency, a private Web security firm based in Wisconsin. “We cannot trace it beyond borders. We’d need the cooperation of the Chinese.”

Xiao Qiang, an expert on Chinese Internet censorship and control, says Jiaotong is studying not just Web security but also how to filter content that the government may deem unhealthy.

“Computer security may sound neutral, but in China, it also includes content, including content the government doesn’t like and wants to get rid of,” he says.

Scott J. Henderson, the author of “The Dark Visitor: Inside the World of Chinese Hackers,” said that in 2007, a prominent Chinese hacker with ties to China’s Ministry of Security also lectured at Jiaotong.

“He gave a lecture called ‘Hacking in a Nutshell,’ ” said Mr. Henderson, whose research was partly financed by the American military.

In a statement on Sunday, Microsoft said it could not comment on reports that some hacking had been traced to Jiaotong.

But the statement also said: “We condemn cyberattacks and industrial espionage no matter who is ultimately responsible. We hope officials will conduct a full investigation and cooperate fully with international authorities to get to the bottom of this situation.”

Google and other companies that were victims of the attacks have declined to comment.

Investigators are also looking into whether some of the intrusions originated at Lanxiang Vocational School, in the city of Jinan.

Lanxiang, which has 30,000 students studying trades like cosmetology and welding, was founded in 1984 by a former military officer on land donated by the military, according to Jinan’s propaganda department.

On its Web site, the school records visits to the campus by military officers and boasts of sending “a large batch of graduates to the army” and says “those graduates become the backbone of the army.”

Graduates of the school’s computer science department are recruited by the local military garrison each year, according to the school’s dean, Mr. Shao, who would give only his last name.

School officials also insist that Lanxiang students are not capable of sophisticated hacking.

“It’s impossible for our students to hack Google and other U.S. companies,” Mr. Shao said in a telephone interview. “They are just high school graduates and not at an advanced level.”

Little information is publicly available about the school’s computer science department. But the school says its computer laboratory is so enormous that it was once listed in the Guinness World Records book.
1575 2010-02-22 The bill was drafted with help from the Animal Legal Defense Fund, an animal-protection group based in Cotati, Calif., north of . The group has promoted the registry not only as a way to notify the public but also as a possible early warning system for other crimes.

“We know there’s a link between those who abuse animals and those who perform other forms of violence,” said Stephan Otto, the group’s director of legislative affairs. “Presumably if we’re able to track animal abusers and be able to know where they live, there will be less opportunity where those vulnerable to them would be near them.”

In addition to sex offenders, California lists arsonists in an online registry, and the animal abusers would be listed on a similar site, Mr. Florez said. Such registries have raised privacy concerns from some civil libertarians, but Joshua Marquis, a member of the defense fund’s board and the district attorney in Clatsop County, Ore., said the worries were unfounded.

“Does it turn that person into a pariah? No,” Mr. Marquis said. “But it gives information to someone who might be considering hiring that person for a job.”

He added: “I do not think for animal abusers it’s unreasonable considering the risk they pose, much like the risk that people who abuse children do.”

One supporter of the proposed law, Gillian Deegan, an assistant commonwealth’s attorney in Botetourt County, Va., says such a registry could also be valuable in tracking people who run puppy mills and animal-fighting rings, as well as hoarders, who sometimes collect hundreds of animals, often resulting in neglect.

“A lot of times these people will just pick up and move to another jurisdiction or another state if they get caught,” said Ms. Deegan, who has written on animal welfare laws. “It would definitely help on those types of cases where people jump around.” One Web site — Petabuse.com — already offers a type of online registry, with listings of animal offenders and their crimes.

Such registries have been introduced in other states, but never passed. In 2008, a similar bill in stalled after passing the State Senate.

That legislation was endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States, said Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive of the society.

Mr. Pacelle said that the proposed financing mechanism for the California bill, a small on pet food, was “an extremely controversial idea” and unpopular with the pet food industry.

Taxes are usually opposed by Republicans in California, and that gives Mr. Pacelle doubts about the bill’s prospects.

“The idea of that succeeding in this climate in California is not high,” he said.

But the bill’s sponsor, Mr. Florez, who recently helped establish an Animal Protection Caucus, which includes Republican members of the State Senate and Assembly, says he is confident that he has the votes to move the measure forward and estimates that the registry would cost less than $1 million to establish. He also said his background — he hails from the farming-friendly Central Valley — will help the cause.

“I think people think, well, if Dean is supporting it,” he said, “it can’t be that off the wall.”
1576 2010-02-22 After nearly a week of public protest over reports that Abbey Road Studios, the London recording complex made famous by the Beatles, had been put up for sale, its owner, the financially troubled British record company EMI, has finally spoken. In a statement issued Sunday morning, EMI denied that the studio was being put on the market but confirmed that it was seeking financial help to save it.

In the statement, which raised nearly as many questions as it answered, EMI said it had received an offer for Abbey Road “in excess of £30 million” (about $46 million) in mid-2009 but had turned it down. “We believe that Abbey Road should remain in EMI’s ownership,” the company said.

EMI, which has been struggling under a large debt load since its $8 billion purchase in 2007 by the private equity firm Terra Firma, said that Abbey Road had been losing money for years. In November, the statement said, EMI began holding talks with an unspecified number of outside parties to provide “a substantial injection of new capital” to finance plans to “revitalize” Abbey Road.

The company did not explain those plans but implied that Abbey Road could be maintained as a recording facility while also being opened to the public. An EMI spokeswoman declined to comment further on the company’s plans. In its statement EMI welcomed the reported interest of English Heritage, a government preservation agency, to protect the property with listed status. The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the lyricist Tim Rice separately have expressed interest in buying the studio.

Abbey Road, an extensive complex with room to record entire orchestras, has been used as a studio since 1931, but in recent years, as record companies have slashed budgets, it has become prohibitively expensive for many artists and labels to record there.

1598 2010-02-23 There were scattered references to Ricci and Ledbetter at the argument, but the justices’ questioning suggested that they did not view the new case, Lewis v. Chicago, No. 08-974, as especially dramatic, consequential or divisive.

Both Ricci and Ledbetter were decided by 5-to-4 votes. But most of the justices asked at least some questions on Monday suggesting sympathy for the firefighters’ position.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that adopting the city’s position could allow discrimination not subject to a suit within the first 300 days to persist forever.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said encouraging people to sue before it was plain they would be harmed is “kind of a bad policy.”

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who wrote the Ledbetter decision, sent mixed signals. He indicated that the city may have misled the black firefighters in its communications to them and said their position “may follow from the language of Title VII.” But he said there were good reasons to require prompt resolution of discrimination claims.

John A. Payton, a lawyer for the firefighters, said Chicago could have protected itself from lawsuits at any time by changing the way it used the test.

The city had said that everyone who scored above 65 was qualified, but it limited its initial hiring to a random selection from among candidates who scored 89 or better. That last group was 11.5 percent black, while 37 percent of all applicants were black.

A trial court judge, in a ruling not contested by the city on appeal, found that “the cut-off score of 89 is statistically meaningless.”

Justice Ginsburg said that collapsing the two tiers of qualified candidates would have solved the problem in the case.

Benna Ruth Solomon, a lawyer for the city, said that solution would have done damage to “the opportunities of the people who were at 89 and above.”

Ms. Solomon suggested that the Ricci decision had placed municipal employers in a no-win situation, and Chief Justice Roberts seemed to acknowledge that the court has issued conflicting legal mandates in this area.

“You have just got to get as good legal advice as you can,” he said. The question the city should ask, he went on, is: “Are we going to be in more trouble if we follow the test or more trouble if we take it down?”
1599 2010-02-23 WASHINGTON — Facing wide criticism over their recent finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public welfare, top Environmental Protection Agency officials said Monday that any regulation of such gases would be phased in gradually and would not impose expensive new rules on most American businesses.

The E.P.A.’s administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, wrote in a letter to eight coal-state Democrats who have sought a moratorium on regulation that only the biggest sources of greenhouse gases would be subjected to limits before 2013. Smaller ones would not be regulated before 2016, she said.

“I share your goals of ensuring economic recovery at this critical time and of addressing greenhouse gas emissions in sensible ways that are consistent with the call for comprehensive energy and climate legislation,” Ms. Jackson wrote.

The eight Democratic senators, led by John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, said hugely significant decisions about energy, the economy and the environment should be made by elected representatives, not by federal bureaucrats.

The senators, who earlier questioned broad cap-and-trade legislation pushed by the Obama administration, join a number of Republican lawmakers, industry groups and officials from Texas, Alabama and Virginia in challenging the proposed E.P.A. regulations of industrial sources. Senate Republicans are going a step further, seeking to prevent the agency from taking any action to limit greenhouse gases, which are tied to global warming.
1600 2010-02-23 MOSCOW (AP) — Irina Arkhipova, a Soviet-era diva who sang at the Bolshoi Theater for decades, died here on Feb. 11. She was 85.

The cause was cardiac arrest, said Nadezhda Khachaturova, the director of the Arkhipova Foundation.

Ms. Arkhipova, a mezzo-soprano and later a contralto, joined the Bolshoi in 1956 and went on to sing many leading roles. She reached the peak of her career in the 1960s and 1970s, making guest appearances throughout Europe and the United States.

Her most celebrated roles included Carmen in Bizet’s “Carmen,” Amneris in Verdi’s “Aida,” Marina in Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov” and Marfa in his “Khovanshchina,” and Hélène in Prokofiev’s “War and Peace.”

She was widely praised for the power and intensity of her voice, and for her technically skilled and highly emotional performances.

Ms. Arkhipova is survived by her husband, a grandson and a great-granddaughter.
1601 2010-02-23 Analysts said Apple appeared to be trying to ensure that the App Store would not scare off potential customers as its products become more mainstream.

The iPod Touch is popular with children and teenagers. And the company is hoping that the iPad, due out next month, will be a hit with families and as an educational tool in schools. That could be a hard sell if the catalog of programs available for it is cluttered with racy applications.

“At the end of the day, Apple has a brand to maintain,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who keeps a close eye on the company. “And the bottom line is they want that image to be squeaky clean.”

The iPad will run the same applications that work on the iPhone and iPod Touch, which demonstrated that consumers were willing to pay for software that turned their devices into gaming machines, e-readers and navigation systems.

“The reality is that the iPad is going to be a big platform for apps,” said Mr. Munster. “It raises the bar for Apple in terms of policing what goes into the App Store.”

Last June, Apple introduced parental controls and ratings to help keep sex-themed applications away from children. But Mr. Munster said that the volume of such apps — which he estimated made up as much as 5 percent of the more than 140,000 apps in the App Store — might have surpassed a level Apple was comfortable with.

Many software developers have long complained about Apple’s strict screening process and, at times, seemingly arbitrary decisions about what was acceptable in the App Store. The company’s latest move, which was first reported by TechCrunch, did little to change their minds.

Fred Clarke, co-president of a small software company called On the Go Girls, which made Sexy Scratch Off, said that as of Monday all 50 of his company’s applications were no longer available. They included an application in which a woman wearing a swimsuit appeared to wipe finger marks from the iPhone’s screen with a rag and spray bottle.

“I’m shocked,” said Mr. Clarke, who said the company had not had a problem with its applications since the first one went on sale last June. “We’re showing stuff that’s racier than the Disney Channel, but not by much.”

Mr. Clarke said his company had been earning thousands of dollars a day from the App Store.

“It’s very hard to go from making a good living to zero,” he said. “This goes farther than sexy content. For developers, how do you know you aren’t going to invest thousands into a business only to find out one day you’ve been cut off?”

Mr. Clarke said the company would still continue to develop applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, but would explore alternative platforms, including Google’s Android.

Mr. Schiller said Apple had to prioritize its customers. “We obviously care about developers, but in the end have to put the needs of the kids and parents first,” he said.

Not all developers were critical of Apple’s stance. Wally Chang, founder of Donoma Games, which does not make sexual applications, said he welcomed the changes. He said he hoped the culling of the catalog would improve the visibility of lesser-known apps.

“There just seems to be too many of these really simple applications that do nothing but show pictures of girls in bikinis or in suggestive, adult poses,” he said. “It’s cluttering up the App Store.”

Mr. Chang acknowledged that Apple’s policies were a little opaque at times.

“Apple needs to be more transparent in how they are applying their policies and communicate that to developers,” he said. “Sports Illustrated still has an application available. How come that hasn’t been pulled?”

Indeed, a Sports Illustrated application tied to its annual swimsuit issue was still available for download on Monday, as was one from Playboy.

When asked about the Sports Illustrated app, Mr. Schiller said Apple took the source and intent of an app into consideration. “The difference is this is a well-known company with previously published material available broadly in a well-accepted format,” he said.

Some developers and analysts wonder if the Android Market, Google’s version of the App Store, will end up becoming a haven for sexually themed applications. The store’s programs work only on phones running Android, which so far are much less popular than Apple’s products.

A Google representative said the company wanted to “reduce friction and remove barriers that make it difficult for developers to make apps available to users.” To that end, Android applications are treated similarly to YouTube videos, which are not screened before they are posted. Apps can be removed if they violate various policies, and users can flag material that they deem inappropriate, giving guidance to others.

Daniel Klaus, who recently co-created a multimillion-dollar fund to foster the development of applications for the iPad, said Apple had challenges ahead of it.

“It’s an incredibly fine line they have to walk to keep the developers happy and at the same time grow the ecosystem,” Mr. Klaus said. “It’s going to be very interesting to see how they continue do that while clamping down on some of the areas that are not in line with the direction they want to go.”
1602 2010-02-23 Re “Criticism of Health Analysis That Was Hailed by Obama” (news article, Feb. 18):

The coverage of the Dartmouth health care measures said that I suggested that hospital-level cost measures weren’t reliable. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Our research in The New England Journal of Medicine and elsewhere has demonstrated that hospital costs can be measured reliably, whether for end-of-life patients or heart attack patients.

Moreover, many of the low-cost hospitals we identify provide higher quality care than many of their higher-spending counterparts. These vast differences in spending and quality across hospitals highlight the enormous potential savings that could be realized — without any sacrifice in quality — through implementing the kinds of payment and delivery system reforms proposed in both the Senate and House health care reform bills.

1603 2010-02-23 All along, the Yankees insisted that it was never personal, that they recognized how snugly Damon fit in their lineup and their clubhouse. But they were also confident in their alternatives. They traded for outfielder Curtis Granderson and starter Javier Vazquez, and signed designated hitter Nick Johnson.

For years, the Yankees have talked internally about keeping their payroll around $200 million. Damon’s agent, Scott Boras, believed it was an arbitrary figure. Part of the reason for Boras’s success is the way he convinces owners — not general managers — to extend their budget for his clients.

In Damon’s case, a final push to the Yankees’ managing general partner, Hal Steinbrenner, fell flat in January. General Manager Brian Cashman and the team president Randy Levine had talked of a one-year deal for Damon of $6 million, with half of it deferred. But according to Damon, Steinbrenner told him he could not even do that much.

“When I had a conversation with Hal, it was short and quick,” Damon said. “He said, ‘We can’t do anything.’ I said: ‘Thank you very much. I had a great time playing for you. It’s time for both sides to move on.’ ”

In Mike Ilitch, though, Boras found an owner willing to do what Steinbrenner would not. The Tigers were coming off a devastating end to the 2009 season, when they blew a seven-game September lead and lost the American League Central. Ilitch was more motivated than Steinbrenner to exceed his projected payroll.

The Tigers needed a proven top-of-the-order hitter to boost the offense. They also needed a free spirit to jolt a clubhouse rocked not only by the collapse but by the cost-cutting trades of Granderson and Edwin Jackson.

“If you see them cutting back salary, that kind of tells me they’re not looking for much — and that is not a good attitude to take in,” Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge said. “If they hadn’t done some of the moves they’ve made of late, it would have had that feel to it. That’s just human nature.”

The Tigers started stirring in January, signing closer Jose Valverde. Early this month, they re-signed the ace starter Justin Verlander for five years and $80 million. Now comes Damon, who will split time in left field and at designated hitter.

Verlander said he had met Damon before, and always believed he would be a good teammate. His winning pedigree with Boston and New York will help, Verlander said, but the Tigers already had an edge.

“The guys that have been here have a fire under their butt, and he’ll feel that as well,” Verlander said. “Obviously he didn’t go through what we went through last year, but anybody in baseball can understand.”

Damon joked with Inge and others in the clubhouse Monday morning, and looked perfectly at ease in his first round of batting practice as a Tiger. As he took his turns in the cage, alternating with Miguel Cabrera and Magglio Ordonez, he said he was thrilled to train just 45 minutes from his home in Orlando. The Tigers, Damon said, had been his first choice as a free agent in 2005.

He repeated that at his news conference, which began with Damon saying the Tigers were his first choice “from Day 1.” Asked for context a few minutes later, Damon acknowledged he meant only after the Yankees’ option had closed.

Damon was wearing his Tigers jersey then, and from a distance he seemed to have a World Series ring on his right hand. Actually, it was a ring designed by his wife, Michelle — a silver skull engraved with baseball stitches, with black diamonds for eyes and crossed bats behind it.

Damon was not wearing his lucky necklace; it had snapped apart, Michelle Damon said with a sigh. She needs to design a new one, and there is no better time. Damon has finished his Yankees visit, and he is starting over again.
1604 2010-02-23 The recession can now claim another troublesome record: state tax collections shrank at the end of 2009 for a fifth consecutive quarter, the longest period of continuing state revenue declines since at least the Great Depression, according to a new report.

Over all, state tax collections fell to $134.5 billion in the last quarter of 2009, a 4.1 percent drop from the $140.2 billion collected during the same period a year earlier, according to the report, which will be released Tuesday by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government.

While the drop in tax collections was less severe than earlier in the year — the record for the steepest drop was set last spring when tax collections fell by 16.6 percent compared with the same period in 2008 — the continuing declines are putting even more stress on states.

The revenue decline comes despite the tax increases imposed by many states since the recession began. With less tax money coming into state treasuries and expenses for programs like Medicaid continuing to mount, many states will probably be forced to consider further tax increases, spending cuts and layoffs — actions that some economists warn could put a drag on the nation’s fragile economic recovery.

The Rockefeller Institute report, which was written by Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst, warns, “State tax revenue will continue to be insufficient to support current spending commitments, and more spending cuts and tax increases are most likely on the way for many states.”

Oklahoma reported the largest revenue drop in the quarter, a 26.9 percent decline compared with the same period the previous year, followed by Arizona, which reported a 17.1 percent drop. Seven states reported growth in revenues, but the report notes that the gains “were often driven by legislated tax increases rather than growth in the economy and tax base.”
1605 2010-02-23 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is looking to lay off hundreds of New York City subway station agents, revising an earlier plan under which they would have been allowed to retire, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.

The layoffs are to be announced on Tuesday, along with cuts to the authority’s administrative and managerial staff, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the revised plan had not been formally unveiled.

About $50 million is expected to be saved with the cuts, which would affect about 450 station agents and more than 600 administrative workers.

The cuts are part of a broad belt-tightening at the authority led by its new chairman, Jay H. Walder, who has spoken forcefully about the need to reel in costs as the agency struggles with a perilous financial situation.

The station agents belong to Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, and the layoffs would be the first for members of that union in decades. The local’s president, John Samuelsen, who has been in office since Jan. 1, has said he will vigorously oppose any attempts to lay off his members.
1606 2010-02-23 Suppose, as some experts advise, that the new national dietary guidelines due this spring will lower the recommended level of salt. Suppose further that public health officials in New York and Washington succeed in forcing food companies to use less salt. What would be the effect?

A) More than 44,000 deaths would be prevented annually (as estimated recently in The New England Journal of Medicine).

B) About 150,000 deaths per year would be prevented annually (as estimated by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene).

C) Hundreds of millions of people would be subjected to an experiment with unpredictable and possibly adverse effects (as argued recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association).

D) Not much one way or the other.

E) Americans would get even fatter than they are today.

Don’t worry, there’s no wrong answer, at least not yet. That’s the beauty of the salt debate: there’s so little reliable evidence that you can imagine just about any outcome. For all the talk about the growing menace of sodium in packaged foods, experts aren’t even sure that Americans today are eating more salt than they used to.

When you don’t know past trends, predicting the future is a wide-open game.

My personal favorite prediction is E, the further fattening of America, but I’m just guided by a personal rule: Never bet against the expansion of Americans’ waistlines, especially not when public health experts get involved.

The harder the experts try to save Americans, the fatter we get. We followed their admirable advice to quit smoking, and by some estimates we gained 15 pounds apiece afterward. The extra weight was certainly a worthwhile trade-off for longer life and better health, but with success came a new challenge.

Officials responded by advising Americans to shun fat, which became the official villain of the national dietary guidelines during the 1980s and 1990s. The anti-fat campaign definitely made an impact on the marketing of food, but as we gobbled up all the new low-fat products, we kept getting fatter. Eventually, in 2000, the experts revised the dietary guidelines and conceded that their anti-fat advice may have contributed to diabetes and obesity by unintentionally encouraging Americans to eat more calories.

That fiasco hasn’t dampened the reformers’ enthusiasm, to judge from the growing campaign to impose salt restrictions. Pointing to evidence that a salt-restricted diet causes some people’s blood pressure to drop, the reformers extrapolate that tens of thousands of lives would be saved if there were less salt in everybody’s food.

But is it even possible to get the public to permanently reduce salt consumption? Researchers have had a hard enough time getting people to cut back during short-term supervised experiments.

The salt reformers say change is possible if the food industry cuts back on all the hidden salt in its products. They want the United States to emulate Britain, where there has been an intensive campaign to pressure industry as well as consumers to use less salt. As a result, British authorities say, from 2000 to 2008 there was about a 10 percent reduction in daily salt consumption, which was measured by surveys that analyzed the amount of salt excreted in urine collected over 24 hours.

But the British report was challenged in a recent article in The Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology by researchers at the University of California, Davis, and Washington University in St. Louis. The team, led by Dr. David A. McCarron, a nephrologist at Davis, criticized the British authorities for singling out surveys in 2008 and 2000 while ignoring nearly a dozen similar surveys conducted in the past two decades.

When all the surveys in Britain are considered, there has been no consistent downward trend in salt consumption in recent years, said Dr. McCarron, who has been a longtime critic of the salt reformers. (For more on him and his foes, go to nytimes.com/tierneylab.) He said that the most notable feature of the data is how little variation there has been in salt consumption in Britain  and just about everywhere else, too.

Dr. McCarron and his colleagues analyzed surveys from 33 countries around the world and reported that, despite wide differences in diet and culture, people generally consumed about the same amount of salt. There were a few exceptions, like tribes isolated in the Amazon and Africa, but the vast majority of people ate more salt than recommended in the current American dietary guidelines.

The results were so similar in so many places that Dr. McCarron hypothesized that networks in the brain regulate sodium appetite so that people consume a set daily level of salt. If so, that might help explain one apparent paradox related to reports that Americans are consuming more daily calories than they used to. Extra food would be expected to come with additional salt, yet there has not been a clear upward trend in daily salt consumption evident over the years in urinalysis studies, which are considered the best gauge because they directly measure salt levels instead of relying on estimates based on people’s recollections of what they ate. Why no extra salt? One prominent advocate of salt reduction, Dr. Lawrence Appel of Johns Hopkins University, said that inconsistent techniques in conducting the urinalysis surveys may be masking a real upward trend in salt consumption.

But Dr. McCarron called the measurements reliable and said they could be explained by the set-point theory:

As Americans ate more calories, they could have eased up on some of the saltier choices so that their overall sodium consumption remained constant. By that same logic, he speculated, if future policies reduce the average amount of salt in food, people might compensate by seeking out saltier foods  or by simply eating still more of everything.

The salt reformers dismiss these speculations, arguing that with the right help, people can maintain low-salt diets without gaining weight or suffering other problems. But even if people could be induced to eat less salt, would they end up better off? The estimates about all the lives to be saved are just extrapolations based on the presumed benefits of lower blood pressure.

If you track how many strokes and heart attacks are suffered by people on low-salt diets, the results aren’t nearly as neat or encouraging, as noted recently in JAMA by Michael H. Alderman, a hypertension expert at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. A low-salt diet was associated with better clinical outcomes in only 5 of the 11 studies he considered; in the rest, the people on the low-salt diet fared either the same or worse.

“When you reduce salt,” Dr. Alderman said, “you reduce blood pressure, but there can also be other adverse and unintended consequences. As more data have accumulated, it’s less and less supportive of the case for salt reduction, but the advocates seem more determined than ever to change policy.”

Before changing public policy, Dr. Alderman and Dr. McCarron suggest trying something new: a rigorous test of the low-salt diet in a randomized clinical trial. That proposal is rejected by the salt reformers as too time-consuming and expensive. But when you contemplate the potential costs of another public health debacle like the anti-fat campaign, a clinical trial can start to look cheap.
1607 2010-02-23 The lawsuit by John Ferriter, former head of reality television at the William Morris Agency, against Ari Emanuel and his new William Morris Endeavor Agency, is over, at least for the moment. Judge Elizabeth A. Grimes of Los Angeles County Superior Court dismissed the suit at a hearing on Monday in Santa Monica, Calif., and sent it to arbitration. Judge Grimes said she would retain jurisdiction over the case if all issues were not resolved by an arbitrator. But for now Mr. Ferriter’s far-ranging suit — which had alleged contractual violations and defamation connected with the merger of Morris and Endeavor — will not result in an open-court battle.
1608 2010-02-23 One day before the debut of Pierre Audi’s much-anticipated new production of Verdi’s “Attila” at the Metropolitan Opera, the Met announced a substitution in a key role. Carlos Álvarez, the Spanish baritone who was to sing the role of Ezio, will not perform in Tuesday night’s premiere because of illness, the Met said in a news release on Monday. Taking Mr. Álvarez’s place will be Giovanni Meoni, who will be making his Met debut. Mr. Meoni has sung at the Teatro la Fenice in Venice and the Teatro dell’Opera in Rome and has sung the role of Ezio in Bari, Italy, the Met said. Riccardo Muti, the former music director and conductor of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, will be making his own Met debut with this production, as will the opera itself.
1609 2010-02-23 “We used to think that touch only served to intensify communicated emotions,” Dr. Hertenstein said. Now it turns out to be “a much more differentiated signaling system than we had imagined.”

To see whether a rich vocabulary of supportive touch is in fact related to performance, scientists at Berkeley recently analyzed interactions in one of the most physically expressive arenas on earth: professional basketball. Michael W. Kraus led a research team that coded every bump, hug and high five in a single game played by each team in the National Basketball Association early last season.

In a paper due out this year in the journal Emotion, Mr. Kraus and his co-authors, Cassy Huang and Dr. Keltner, report that with a few exceptions, good teams tended to be touchier than bad ones. The most touch-bonded teams were the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers, currently two of the league’s top teams; at the bottom were the mediocre Sacramento Kings and Charlotte Bobcats.

The same was true, more or less, for players. The touchiest player was Kevin Garnett, the Celtics’ star big man, followed by star forwards Chris Bosh of the Toronto Raptors and Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz. “Within 600 milliseconds of shooting a free throw, Garnett has reached out and touched four guys,” Dr. Keltner said.

To correct for the possibility that the better teams touch more often simply because they are winning, the researchers rated performance based not on points or victories but on a sophisticated measure of how efficiently players and teams managed the ball — their ratio of assists to giveaways, for example. And even after the high expectations surrounding the more talented teams were taken into account, the correlation persisted. Players who made contact with teammates most consistently and longest tended to rate highest on measures of performance, and the teams with those players seemed to get the most out of their talent.

The study fell short of showing that touch caused the better performance, Dr. Kraus acknowledged. “We still have to test this in a controlled lab environment,” he said.

If a high five or an equivalent can in fact enhance performance, on the field or in the office, that may be because it reduces stress. A warm touch seems to set off the release of oxytocin, a hormone that helps create a sensation of trust, and to reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

In the brain, prefrontal areas, which help regulate emotion, can relax, freeing them for another of their primary purposes: problem solving. In effect, the body interprets a supportive touch as “I’ll share the load.”

“We think that humans build relationships precisely for this reason, to distribute problem solving across brains,” said James A. Coan, a a psychologist at the University of Virginia. “We are wired to literally share the processing load, and this is the signal we’re getting when we receive support through touch.”

The same is certainly true of partnerships, and especially the romantic kind, psychologists say. In a recent experiment, researchers led by Christopher Oveis of Harvard conducted five-minute interviews with 69 couples, prompting each pair to discuss difficult periods in their relationship.

The investigators scored the frequency and length of touching that each couple, seated side by side, engaged in. In an interview, Dr. Oveis said that the results were preliminary.

“But it looks so far like the couples who touch more are reporting more satisfaction in the relationship,” he said.

Again, it’s not clear which came first, the touching or the satisfaction. But in romantic relationships, one has been known to lead to the other. Or at least, so the anecdotal evidence suggests.
1610 2010-02-23 KABUL, Afghanistan  Hajji Zaman Ghamsharik, the Afghan warlord accused of helping Osama bin Laden escape from the Americans at Tora Bora, had so many enemies that his assassination on Monday came as no particular surprise.

What was a surprise was the manner of Hajji Zaman’s death: by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest, who killed him and 14 others as they gathered at a ceremony to distribute land to returning refugees at a village in his tribal stomping grounds near the eastern city of Jalalabad.

His enemies were not just the ideological kind. There was also a blood feud between him and the family of another warlord, which blamed Hajji Zaman for his assassination in 2002. There were rivals to his large and powerful Khugiani tribe in Nangahar Province, and rivals within the tribe. And there were furious American Special Forces and C.I.A. operatives who believed he was a mercenary who took money to join the fight against Al Qaeda but then helping arrange Mr. bin Laden’s escape.

Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan are usually quick to take responsibility for suicide bombings. Not in this case; when asked about Hajji Zaman’s killing, the usually garrulous Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said he did not know who did it.

The police in Nangarhar Province said the killing took place in the village of Dasht-e-Chamtala, about 10 miles west of Jalalabad, during a ceremony for local residents lured by land grants to return from camps for the displaced, according to a police official, Gen. Mohammad Ayob Salangi. At 3:45 p.m., the bomber entered the midst of a crowd of officials, including the returnees and repatriation department chief, Shams ul-Rahman Shams. In addition to the 15 killed, 20 people were wounded, many of them critically, the general said.

“We don’t know exactly who the target was, but we think it was either Hajji Zaman Ghamsharik or the head of the refugee department,” said General Salangi. Mr. Shams, however, was only wounded so presumably not as close to the bomber.

“He was a warlord, and he was fighting since 1980,” said Mirwais Yasini, a member of the Afghan Parliament from Nangarhar. “He was bitterly disliked by very many people. And then there were business interests too.”

During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, he was a mujahideen leader, and later fought both for and against the Taliban. When the Taliban regime collapsed, President Hamid Karzai appointed him military commander of Jalalabad and a large part of eastern Afghanistan, including Tora Bora.

That put him at odds with another warlord in the area, Hajji Qadir, who later ousted him in Jalalabad. When Mr. bin Laden and his Qaeda followers took refuge in the Tora Bora mountains south of Jalalabad in late 2001, Hajji Zaman and another warlord, Hazrat Ali, offered the services of their armed followers to help the Americans flush them out.

Instead, Mr. bin Laden and his group escaped. Many American officials were convinced they could not have done so without collusion from the Afghan warlords.

Hajji Zaman “had a very adventurous life,” said Babrak Shinwari, another member of Parliament from Nangahar. “But there was always a lot of intertribal fighting, even fighting within his tribe, and he had a lot of enemies.”

The uproar over Mr. bin Laden’s escape led to Hajji Zaman’s flight and exile to France and Pakistan for most of the next eight years. During that time, he was accused of engineering the assassination in Kabul of Hajji Qadir, who by then had become a vice president in Mr. Karzai’s government. Hajji Zaman’s brother was detained in connection with the case for several years but never convicted.

Finally Hajji Zaman announced that he would return last year to take part in the election campaign as a Karzai supporter. When he crossed the Torkhum border from Pakistan, a huge motorcade and throngs of cheering supporters greeted for him. Many were from his Khugiani tribe, whose support Mr. Karzai was courting. Hajji Zaman was whisked to Kabul in a government helicopter.

“He came back just a few months ago, it’s really tragic,” said Anwar al-Haq Ahadi, a former finance minister in Mr. Karzai’s government. “He was going to play quite a larger role in the future.”

There are a number of former warlords in the Karzai government and in Parliament. Hazrat Ali, the other Tora Bora commander, is a member of Parliament.

Recently, President Karzai has been hosting a tribal jirga, or council, to try to resolve the issue of whether Hajji Zaman had been responsible for the assassination of Hajji Qadir, but their families and tribal followers had been unable to reach the required consensus.

Despite the cloud over his head, Hajji Zaman was apparently invited to the land distribution ceremony as a tribal elder. Several other tribal leaders were among the dead.

Mr. Yasini said he did not necessarily believe that the assassination was motivated by ideology. “Now some suiciders can be bought and sold,” he said. “You go to the Taliban and pay them a lot of money, and the suicider never knows what the reason for his mission is.”
1611 2010-02-23 Volatility returned to Wall Street on Monday, ending a four-day winning streak for stocks, as worries over the energy sector overshadowed hopes that banks would continue to bring in generous profits.

With little on the economic calendar, the attention turned to Washington and the political struggles underpinning the debate over monetary policy.

Investors spent Monday trying to divine what the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, would say when he testified before a House committee on Wednesday. With unemployment high and many parts of the economy still depending on government support, investors were betting that Mr. Bernanke would reiterate his pledge to keep interest rates near zero in the immediate future.

“It certainly seems like the tone of what he says about the recovery is going to be a lot better,” said Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. “But the private sector is not self-sustaining just yet, and it is too early for the Fed to engage in a broad policy normalization.”

That consensus was enough to spur a rally for banking stocks, with JPMorgan Chase rising 2 percent, Wells Fargo climbing 2.34 percent and Citigroup gaining 1.17 percent. Low interest rates have translated into extraordinary profits for banks, allowing them to borrow cheaply and lend at higher rates.
1612 2010-02-23 In an effort at self-humanization, Mr. Brown has occasionally positioned his mouth into a smile. He has revealed little personal details, like his habit of eating as many as nine bananas a day in an effort to lay off the chocolate and to lose weight.

“They’ve been trying to make him seem like a softer, more emotional character,” said Tony Travers, director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics. “In that sense this story could not have been worse.”

How many of the new details are true is anybody’s guess. Downing Street and a bevy of cabinet officials rushed to deny that Mr. Brown was a bully. The prime minister himself was moved to declare that no, he did not strike his workers.

“I do not do these sorts of things,” Mr. Brown told Channel 4 news. “Any allegations that have been made about hitting people are completely untrue.”

In a strange development, the National Bullying Helpline, a charity where the aggrieved seek confidential advice, said that it was so infuriated by Downing Street’s denials that it felt compelled to disclose that it had had “several inquiries from staff within Gordon Brown’s office.”

“We are not suggesting that Gordon Brown is a bully; what we are saying is staff in his office, working directly with him, have issues and have concerns and have contacted our helpline,” Christine Pratt, the line’s director, told the BBC. Labour officials said the group had ties to the Conservative Party.

In Mr. Rawnsley’s account, Mr. Brown at one point became so incensed at the loss by the government of a computer disk containing 20 million people’s personal banking details that he leaped across his office, seized the lapels of Downing Street’s deputy chief of staff and snarled, “They’re out to get me!” This is a far cry from the cozy image that Mr. Brown tried to project last week in an interview on a celebrity talk show.

Mr. Brown reminisced about his days as a beer-swilling, long-haired student. He made some jocular remarks. He said he proposed to his wife on a Scottish beach by announcing, “I want to get married soon,” and spoke movingly of his pain at the death of their infant daughter, Jennifer.

But it is not working out so well. Just the way President was forever seen as clumsy, so Mr. Brown is invariably seen as someone who can snatch public relations disaster from the jaws of easy triumph.

A question-and-answer session last fall on the influential mothers’ Web site Mumsnet, for instance, ended in embarrassment when Mr. Brown appeared unwilling to reveal the identity of his favorite cookie. (He claimed he had not seen the question, and later said it was chocolate digestives.)

And he was roundly lampooned last year for posting an uncharacteristically smiley message on . (Someone quickly set it to techno and called it “Dance of the Comedian by Gordon ‘Vote Me Out’ Brown.”) “This is an example of how not to use a social media tool,” Charlie Osmond, a British entrepreneur, wrote on a marketing Web site.

Meanwhile, the coup that should have been ’s visit last year featured an unscripted moment of pure Brownian gaucheness.

As they entered Downing Street, Mr. Obama paused at the doorstep to spontaneously shake hands with a police officer. It would follow that Mr. Brown might have liked to do the same thing. But after making a brief, awkward lurch toward the officer, Mr. Brown turned and went inside — just as the officer stuck out his hand.

What is to be done?

No one is sure.

“He has a very bad public image — it’s really negative in almost every way,” said Roger Mortimore, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, a British polling company. “The worse he’s doing, the more morose he’s going to look.”
1613 2010-02-23 Air passengers with peanut allergies often have to make special arrangements before flying, but as airlines have started allowing pets in the passenger cabin, many more travelers are being exposed to unnecessary health risks, several Canadian doctors maintain.

In an editorial last week in The Canadian Medical Association Journal, the physicians called for banning pets from airplane passenger cabins, warning that exposure to animals can set off discomfort, asthma attacks or even life-threatening reactions.

“Pets can be accommodated comfortably and safely in airplane cargo holds, which is where they belong,” the doctors wrote.

One in 10 people have allergies to animals, and for some, exposure to dogs and cats can set off an asthma attack or a life-threatening reaction like anaphylaxis, said Dr. Matthew B. Stanbrook, the journal’s deputy scientific editor and an asthma specialist.

The editorial was in response to Air Canada’s decision last summer to start allowing small pets, including cats, dogs and birds, to travel in the passenger cabin. Many United States airlines have similar policies.

“The thing about allergies is they’re unpredictable,” Dr. Stanbrook said. “You can have mild reactions for a long time and then have a severe one — it’s hard to predict.”

1632 2010-02-24 The personal assistant of Linda S. Stein, who had managed the Ramones and was a real estate agent for celebrities, was convicted on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the bludgeoning death of Ms. Stein in October 2007.

The jurors reached their verdict against the personal assistant, Natavia S. Lowery, about five hours after they began deliberations in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Ms. Lowery, 28, was also convicted of charges that she stole tens of thousands of dollars from Ms. Stein.

Ms. Lowery, who faces 25 years to life in prison, is scheduled to be sentenced March 22 by Justice Richard D. Carruthers, who presided over the trial.

The case drew widespread attention because of both Ms. Stein’s celebrity and the brutality of the killing. Ms. Stein, 62, was found on the floor of her Upper East Side apartment in a pool of blood, her body marked with about two dozen wounds. Prosecutors said she was bludgeoned by a blunt object, but no murder weapon was ever recovered.

As the verdict was read, one of Ms. Stein’s daughters, Mandy Stein, stared straight ahead and breathed heavily as she clasped her hands in a fist below her chin.
1633 2010-02-24 The only way to view the event is on horseback or by leapfrogging ahead in trucks on dirt roads and waiting for a glimpse of the dogs as they run by at a trail crossing. Mounted spectators can number as many 500, all following the judges, dog owners and handlers, who themselves trail the dogs through the damp winter farm country.

The competition this year was hammered by storms, with snow crusting into paw-slashing ice that made the 6,000-acre course unsafe, setting the schedule back more than three days. After the weather cleared, dogs ran through melting snow and mud.

One day last week, Sheldon Twer, a trainer from Oakdale, Calif., waited for the dogs to come through at a crossing point. He competes in about 25 field trials a year and, for him, Ames is the only place to be in February. "The dogs that make it to this level are exceptional,” Twer said. “It’s really an honor to be here. You can sell a dog for $50,000 that’s made it to this level. It costs about $6,000 to $7,000 a year to develop one. You get four or five years in them.”

One purpose of field trialing is to identify the top bloodlines and to pass along the DNA of the dogs with an indomitable drive to hunt. Through breeding, the characteristics of a champion will eventually transfer into the general population of bird dogs that are companions to the average upland bird hunter.

Two dogs emerged through the bramble: Elhew Sinbad, a white-coated pointer, and Highground Jax Jabba, a spotted setter. Their flanks were slathered with mud and they loped by, tongues agape.

The mounted spectators, approximately 200, passed the people parked at the crossing point. Everyone seemed to know one another. Some hollered out to Twer and he waved back.

“We work together,” Twer said. “Like any sport there are some guys that don’t like each other — some animosity — but for the most part, it’s a pretty close-knit group. It’s worse than a cult. It’s an addiction.”

Two days earlier, In the Shadow set the high mark by finding 10 quail. When a dog smells quail, it freezes, steady and statuelike, and remains locked on three legs with one forepaw tucked under its chest. With the dog on point, the handler wades into the brush, flushes the covey of quail and fires a starter pistol. The birds are not killed, but counted as a “find.” The dog must not flinch as the birds take flight and must stand staunch until released by the handler.

Penalties are given for “unproductives,” referring to when a dog points to a quail that does not exist, or points to another creature. This year, cottontail rabbits and armadillos were pointed.

If two dogs are hunting in close proximity and one goes on point, the other dog must freeze behind the pointing dog (the dog receives credit for doing so).

“There’s an old saying — you’ll never win a field trial with a back, but if your dog fails to back, you could lose one,” said Ken Blackman, a field trialer who helps videotape the event.

In most field trials, dogs run only for an hour, but at Ames they run for three and are expected to finish with surplus vigor. Judges look for big-running dogs that quarter forward through the brush hungering for quail. At the end of the competition, In the Shadow was declared judged the champion. For the other dogs, there is always next year, but they still have to qualify in other field trials to make it back to Ames.

“I told the old gentleman who started me in this sport 40 years ago that it probably would have been better to give me a gram of cocaine because then I could have done my time in prison,” said Larry Garner, an amateur bird dog field trialer from Dallas. “I could have gone through rehab and become a productive citizen again instead of being addicted to bird dogs and chasing them all over the United States and Canada.”
1634 2010-02-24 Not all of the banks on the F.D.I.C.’s list will be seized. Many banks work their way through difficulties, raise private capital or are taken over by healthier rivals. And the F.D.I.C. can levy another special assessment on banks before asking the taxpayer to pitch in. Add it all up, and the F.D.I.C. has no financial excuse to avoid cleaning up the mess.

Yet the pace of bank seizures — up by half so far this year — hasn’t kept pace with the growth of the problem bank list. The worry is that zombie banks will suck up deposits and hoard capital that might otherwise be lent out by healthy institutions.

The winter storms that closed down Washington this month complicated travel plans for F.D.I.C. staff members. But the main lesson from the savings-and-loan debacle of the 1980s and 1990s was that delays in closing insolvent banks increase resolution costs for the F.D.I.C. and, ultimately, taxpayers.

With spring around the corner, Ms. Bair needs to set her sights on a big zombie hunting trip.

The conventional wisdom is that Japan has never really recovered from the bursting of the stock market and real estate bubbles in 1990. That view is basically wrong.

Sure, prices have not recovered. The stock market is still almost 75 percent below its peak, and land prices are down 60 percent. After two decades of nearly stable consumer prices, the Japanese government is once again badgering the central bank to do something to create a bit of inflation.

This appeal, like so many before it, is likely to end inconclusively. Japan will continue with its longstanding pattern of near-stable prices, slow growth and gargantuan government deficits. But the economy is basically in pretty good shape.

While the economic growth — about 1 percent a year since 1990 — seems unimpressive, the number of people below retirement age has been shrinking by 0.4 percent a year. Annual growth in per capita gross domestic product in the United States over the same period was 1.4 percent — not much different from Japan’s.

Other economic indicators suggest Japan is managing pretty well. Even midrecession, car sales are only 20 percent less than at the 1990 peak.

Housing starts are down 50 percent, but the population was rising then and is declining now. The 5 percent unemployment rate is modest by Western standards. And the 1.4 percent yield on the 10-year government bond hardly seems a vote of no confidence in the government or the country.

The country’s financial burden — gross government debt at 200 percent of G.D.P. — could yet prove too much to bear for a rapidly aging and steadily declining Japanese population. But for now, Japan should be more a sign of hope than gloom for the United States, Britain and euro zone countries that have endured a severe financial collapse.

Japan had advantages in dealing with its financial collapse. It has a high savings rate, a big trade surplus and a powerful tradition of cultural and political unity. Few Western countries have all of these. Most also face almost Japanese-style demographic challenges. They will be fortunate to do as well as Japan.
1635 2010-02-24 IN an empty fluorescent-lighted hallway on the second floor of Smith Hall here at Carnegie Mellon University, Prof. Paul Rybski and a pair of graduate students showed off their most advanced creation.

The culmination of two years of research and the collective expertise of 17 faculty members, undergraduates and doctoral students in the Human Robot Interaction Group, it is a robot outfitted with a $20,000 laser navigation system, sonar sensors and a Point Grey Bumblebee 2 stereo camera that functions as its eyes, which stare out from its clay-colored plastic, gender-neutral face.

With Dr. Rybski looking on like a proud parent, a bearded graduate student clacked away at a laptop on a roving service cart, and the robot rolled forward to fulfill its primary function: the delivery of one foil-wrapped Nature Valley trail-mix flavor granola bar.

“Hello, I’m the Snackbot,” it said in a voice not unlike that of HAL 9000, from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” as its rectangular LED “mouth” pulsated to form the words. “I’ve come to deliver snacks to Ian. Is Ian here?”

I responded affirmatively. “Oh, hello, Ian,” it said. “Here is your order. I believe it was a granola bar, right?”

Yes, it was. “All right, go ahead and take your snack. I’m sure it would be good, but I wouldn’t know. I prefer a snack of electricity.”

Designed to gather information on how robots interact with people (and how to improve homo-robo relations), the Snackbot has been carefully considered for maximum approachability in every detail, from its height to its color. The snack, not surprisingly, is the central component of that approachability.

“We figured, what better way to get people to interact with a robot than have something that offers them food?” Dr. Rybski said.

The Snackbot is but one soldier in a veritable army of new robots designed to serve and cook food and, in the process, act as good-will ambassadors, and salesmen, for a more automated future.

In 2006, after four years of research and more than a quarter-million-dollar investment, Fanxing Science and Technology, a company in Shenzhen, China, unveiled what was called the “world’s first cooking robot”  AIC-AI Cooking Robot  able, at the touch of a button, to fry, bake, boil and steam its way through thousands of Chinese delicacies from at least three culinary regions.

AIC-AI needs a special stove for cooking, but many of the mechanized culinary wizards developed since then can work on almost any kind of stove, as long as the robot is either shown ahead of time how a particular stove works or the stove’s characteristics are programmed into the robot’s software.

In 2008, scientists at the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland, came out with one such teachable chef, the Chief Cook Robot, which can make omelets (ham and Gruyère were in its first) and bears a resemblance to the Pillsbury Doughboy. That same year, at the Osaka Museum of Creative Industries in Japan, a programmable robot began preparing takoyaki (octopus balls) from scratch, a chef’s bandana wrapped jauntily around its upper module.

Last June, at the International Food Machinery and Technology Expo in Tokyo, a broad-shouldered Motoman SDA-10 robot with spatulas for arms made okonomiyaki (savory pancakes) for attendees; another robot grabbed sushi with an eerily realistic hand; and still another, the Dynamizer, sliced cucumbers at inhumanly fast speeds and occasionally complained about being tired and wanting to go home.

Then, a month later in Nagoya, Japan, the Famen restaurant opened, with two giant yellow robot arms preparing up to 800 bowls of ramen a day. When it’s slow, the robots act out a scripted comedy routine and spar with knives.

“The concept of this restaurant is that Robot No. 1 is the manager, which boils the noodles, and Robot No. 2 is the deputy manager, which prepares for soup and puts toppings,” said Famen’s owner, Kenji Nagaya. “Human staffs are working for the two robots.”

In the throes of an economic downturn, with unemployment rates mounting, the very idea of a robot chef might seem indulgent at best  at worst, downright offensive. But these robots aren’t likely to be running the grill stations or bringing you chowder anytime soon  and the bad economy might be part of the reason. At $100,000 a pair, Mr. Nagaya said, the cost of his robots is “too high to make bowls of ramen.”
1636 2010-02-24 One theme of the Alpine schedule at Whistler remained consistent — the once dominant men’s Austrian ski team did not win a medal. Austrians had won the previous three Olympic men’s giant slalom races. Tuesday, they placed three racers near the top. To their chagrin — as the Swiss, their longtime rivals, celebrated — the Austrian threesome of Marcel Hirscher, Romed Baumann and Benjamin Raich finished fourth, fifth and sixth.

The Austrian men have not won a medal at these Games. The women’s team has a gold and a bronze.

Janka, who led after the first run, had a winning combined time of 2 minutes 37.83 seconds, which was 0.39 of a second ahead of the 24-year-old Jansrud. Svindal was 0.22 of a second behind Jansrud.

Janka actually admitted after the race to being what he is never expected to be: nervous. “I felt the pressure in between the first and second runs because I knew it would be a big thing to win for the Swiss team,” Janka said. “And I was a little bothered that I had not won a medal earlier.”

Two days earlier, Janka was fourth in the super-combined, missing the bronze medal by 0.22. In the super-G, he was eighth, although just 0.18 of a second from third place. In the downhill, he underperformed, finishing 11th.

“He was really disappointed, really down,” the Swiss coach Jorg Roten said of Janka. “We tried to lift his morale a bit yesterday, but even this morning I was not 100 percent sure that it was going to work. What definitely helped him was the course setting and the course condition itself, which was more snow than ice.”

As the Iceman said, he does not like ice.

“Carlo has a light touch and can find speed on snow like this,” Roten said. “The angles he takes are small and in conditions like this it’s the way to ski the fastest.”

Janka’s smooth efficient style is often called boring. He is rarely out of control with arms flailing, like Miller, and though he is 6 feet and 195 pounds, he does not typically charge like a power ski racer.

“He is his own,” his teammate Didier Cuche said. “He is not like anyone else.”

The American Ted Ligety, who finished ninth, said of Janka: “He just makes it look easy. But of course it’s not easy. He does it with tight lines and unbelievable balance over his skis.”

Jansrud came back from 11th in the first run to vault onto the podium. “I was just trying to get anywhere near the podium,” said Jansrud, who has never won a major international race.

Svindal, who was third after the first run, will go for a fourth medal in a showdown of sorts with Miller on Saturday. No men’s Alpine skier has won four medals in one Olympics.

“I’ll let everyone else do the counting,” Svindal said when asked about chasing a fourth medal. “And I’ll think about it Saturday night.”

Miller skied well in the opening portion of the race and trailed Janka by just 0.12 of a second, but he quickly had trouble with the technical, quick-paced course. He made a late pass at a gate that caused him to slip until his hip was touching the snow. And though he recovered, his hand clipped another gate, which had him off-balance and fighting to stay on the course again.

Miller righted himself, but by the next timed interval was more than a second off Janka’s pace.

About 10 seconds later, Miller skittered through a succession of S-shaped turns — unsteady and starting his turns later and later — until he skied out of the race course, unable to negotiate a right-footed turn to the left.

The outcome was almost to be expected. Miller had entered just two previous giant slalom races in the current World Cup season and could not get to the second run in either. After exiting the course, Miller did not ski to the finish area, where reporters waited.

“Bode skied great up top and then went down on his hip, made a recovery like only Bode can but came in late to the next panel and hooked a gate with his hand,” Sasha Rearick, the United States ski team men’s head coach, said. “He then made another spectacular recovery. He was pushing to make up time. He was happy and would have liked to be in there, but he was skiing with passion.”
1637 2010-02-24 As the crisis has unfolded over the past months, Iran said it had begun processing uranium to the higher level of enrichment — 20 percent — required for the Tehran medical reactor, bringing it a major technical step closer to the ability to enrich fuel to the 90-percent level required for weapon-grade fuel. In public, Iranian officials have frequently asserted their readiness for a simultaneous exchange of low-enriched uranium for fuel rods.

On Monday, Tehran also let it be known that it planned to build 10 more nuclear enrichment facilities, two of them within the next year, although its technical capacity to build the plants was unclear.

In a letter on Tuesday, Iran’s ambassador to the atomic agency, Ali Ashgar Soltanieh, told the agency that Iran was “still ready to purchase the fuel it needs for Tehran’s research reactor,” the state-run Press TV broadcaster said. A Western official with knowledge of the negotiations said the letter was the first written, formal response by Iran to the October proposal.

“Iran is ready to simultaneously exchange the fuel required for the Tehran research reactor with its low-enriched uranium within Iranian territory if the I.A.E.A. lacks the ability to fulfill its duties,” the letter was quoted as saying. The Western official said the Iranian letter amounted to a rejection of the October proposal. The official spoke in return for anonymity because he was not authorized to be quoted by name.

Since October, Tehran’s rhetoric has grown more strident, possibly a tactic to distract attention from profound unrest following last June’s disputed presidential election that has offered the Iranian government its most sustained political crisis since the Islamic Revolution 31 years ago.

In a speech on Tuesday broadcast live on Iranian television, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said any attack on Iran would meet with a crushing response, Press TV reported.

“We will welcome a hand which has sincerely reached out for friendship, but if a hand is extended for aggression, the nation will cut it from the arm,” he said in the northeastern town of Birjand, according to Press TV.

His language mirrored the words of President Obama just over one year ago when he said his incoming administration was ready to “extend a hand” to those willing “to unclench your fist.”

Mr. Ahmadinejad repeated a frequent protestation by himself and other Iranian leaders that Tehran was not seeking to build a nuclear bomb. He said Iran still “welcomed a nuclear fuel swap deal without any preconditions inside the Iranian territory,” Press TV said.

Some analysts have said that, effectively, the I.A.E.A. proposal from last October has collapsed. But, with the West demanding tougher sanctions while China, in particular, resists such penalties, the dictates of international diplomacy dictate that neither side is prepared to formally pronounce it dead.
1638 2010-02-24 Five million people are now at or beyond that point, First American estimates, up from 4.5 million in the third quarter.

The research firm recalibrated its data in the third quarter, which means earlier negative equity numbers are not comparable. But it said that the number of severely underwater borrowers was growing even faster than it expected a few weeks ago.

“Home prices in the worst areas — Florida, Nevada and Arizona — fell more than we had expected, increasing the amount of negative equity,” a First American senior economist, Sam Khater, said.

First American’s home price index, released last week, fell for both December and the fourth quarter. That contrasted with the improving Case-Shiller numbers.

The two firms measure different groups of homeowners using different methodologies. The disparate results indicate how difficult it is at the moment to get a fix on the housing market.

There is a widespread feeling among analysts that the market is being kept afloat by the government’s emergency measures, especially the tax credit for buyers. The market’s true level will become apparent only after the tax credit ends in the spring — assuming it is not renewed as it was in the fall.

Prices in the West Coast cities tracked by Case-Shiller, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Diego, increased the most in December. Laggards were Chicago, New York and Tampa, Fla.

“The recovery has slowed since the summer months, but it has not completely fallen apart,” Maureen Maitland, S.& P.’s vice president for index services, said. “We’re in a bit of a flat period.”

Las Vegas, the worst hit of all the major housing markets, managed its second consecutive monthly gain. “Vegas was so battered there is now a tiny bit of hope,” Ms. Maitland said. “You can only fall so much.”

In the case of Las Vegas, that was apparently a drop of 57 percent from its peak. Seven of 10 homeowners with mortgages in Nevada owe more on their properties than they are worth, according to the First American data. In Arizona and Florida, about half the owners are underwater.

Further price declines could give many of these owners the impetus to walk away. If interest rates rise and the tax credit is not renewed, another slump is expected. Nationally, prices are already about where they were in summer 2003. Further declines could add up to a lost decade for housing prices.

Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., said he expected the market to drop after the tax credit expired. At that point, he said, “more of the true fundamentals will come through on pricing.”

In the spring, the seasonal adjustment factors will tend to weigh on Case-Shiller prices, rather than bolster them as they do now. Without the adjustments, most of the cities in the index fell in December. The composite dropped 0.2 percent for the second consecutive month.

On an annual basis, the 20-city index was down 3.1 percent. That figure has improved consistently for a year. Only three cities — Detroit, Tampa and Las Vegas — are still showing double-digit annual declines.

The quarterly return for the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of national home prices, which incorporates data from a broader slice of the country, was also released on Tuesday. That index fell 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2008.

1651 2010-02-25 The image of that boy and of the dangling homemade noose comes rushing back whenever I meet another victim or read about the grim mortality statistics associated with this so-called game. But one thing has haunted me even more in the years since that night. As a doctor who counts adolescents among her patients, I knew nothing about the choking game before I cared for a child who had died “playing” it.

Until recently, there has been little attention among health care professionals to this particular form of youthful thrill-seeking. What has been known, however, is that children ages 7 to 21 participate in such activities alone or in groups, holding their breath, strangling one another or dangling in a noose in the hopes of attaining a legal high.

Two years ago the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 82 deaths attributable to the choking game and related activities. This year the C.D.C. released the results of the first statewide survey and found that one in three eighth graders in Oregon had heard of the choking game, while more than one in 20 had participated.

The popularity of the choking game may boil down to one fact: adolescents believe it is safe. In one recent study, almost half of the youths surveyed believed there was no risk associated with the game. And unlike other risk-taking behaviors like alcohol or drug abuse where doctors and parents can counsel teenagers on the dangers involved, no one is countering this gross misperception regarding the safety of near strangulation.

Why? Because like me that night in the operating room, many of my colleagues have no clue that such a game even exists.

This month in the journal Pediatrics, researchers from the Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland reported that almost a third of physicians surveyed were unaware of the choking game. These doctors could not describe any of the 11 warning signs, which include bloodshot eyes and frequent and often severe headaches. And they failed to identify any one of the 10 alternative names for the choking game, startlingly benign monikers like Rush, Space Monkey, Purple Dragon and Funky Chicken.

“Doctors have a unique opportunity to see and prevent this,” said Dr. Nancy E. Bass, an associate professor of pediatrics and neurology at Case Western Reserve University and senior author of the study. “But how are they going to educate parents and patients if they don’t know about it?”

In situations where a patient may be contemplating or already participating in choking activities, frank discussions about the warning signs can be particularly powerful. “The sad thing about these cases,” Dr. Bass observed, “is that every parent says, ‘If we had known what to look for, we probably could have prevented this.’ ” One set of parents told Dr. Bass that they had noticed knotted scarves and ties and a bowing closet rod in their son’s room weeks before his death.

“They had the telltale signs,” Dr. Bass said, “but they never knew what to look for.”

Nonetheless, broaching the topic can be difficult for both parents and doctors. Some parents worry that talking about such activities will paradoxically encourage adolescents to participate. “But that’s kind of a naïve thought,” Dr. Bass countered. “Children can go to the Internet and YouTube to learn about the choking game.” In another study published last year, for example, Canadian researchers found 65 videos of the choking game from postings to YouTube over an 11-day period. The videos showed various techniques of strangulation and were viewed almost 175,000 times. But, Dr. Bass added, “these videos don’t say that kids can die from doing this.”

Still, few doctors discuss these types of activities with their adolescent patients. Only two doctors in Dr. Bass’s study reported ever having tackled the topic because of a lack of time. “Talking about difficult topics is really hard to do,” Dr. Bass noted, “when you just have 15 minutes to follow up.”

But it is even harder when neither doctor nor patient has any idea of what the activity is or of its lethal consequences.

Based on the results of their study, Dr. Bass and her co-investigators have started programs that educate doctors, particularly those in training, about the warning signs and dangers of strangulation activities. “The choking game may not be as prominent as some of the other topics we cover when we talk with patients,” Dr. Bass said, “but it results in death.”

And, she added, “If we don’t talk to doctors about this issue, they won’t know about the choking game until one of their patients dies.”

1660 2010-02-25 WASHINGTON — As part of an effort to save a financial regulation bill, the Obama administration is prepared to agree that an existing agency, rather than a new agency, could take responsibility for consumer protections as long as the regulators have substantive powers.

“We think an independent consumer regulator, with rule-making and enforcement powers, is critical, and our position hasn’t changed one iota,” an administration official said late Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid disrupting negotiations over the bill.

The official said the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was committed to such a proposal.

Mr. Geithner met with two senators leading the negotiations, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee and Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee and a committee member, on Wednesday night in a last-ditch effort to arrive at a bipartisan bill.

Aides to the three men declined to provide details of their discussion other than to say they all hoped a compromise could be reached.

The Obama administration last June proposed the creation of a new agency to oversee consumer financial products like mortgages, credit cards and payday loans, and the House passed a regulatory overhaul in December that included the proposal.

But the idea has met with resistance from some parts of the banking industry, and for weeks, members of the Senate Banking Committee had been deadlocked over the idea.
1661 2010-02-25 The overdoses at CoxHealth occurred in a state where there is little or no government oversight of radiation therapy, a fact that Robert H. Bezanson, the hospital’s president and chief executive, chose to emphasize.

On Wednesday, he released a letter that he wrote to the Food and Drug Administration, saying that its recent decision to toughen oversight of diagnostic radiation did not go far enough.

“The initiative should be broadened to include regulation of medical radiation therapy as well,” he wrote. “We have also learned that the incident here at CoxHealth is, unfortunately, not an isolated occurrence. Rather, similar instances of medical overradiation have occurred at other hospitals throughout the country. Without increased regulation and oversight, these instances of medical overradiation will likely continue.”

The hospital promised to work with state legislators on ways to better regulate radiation therapy.

Last month, The New York Times documented the harm that can result from radiation errors when basic safety rules are not followed. It also found that in a variety of ways, the pace of technology had outpaced the ability of the medical profession and regulators to keep up.

The overdoses in Springfield echoed what occurred at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla., where a similar commissioning error resulted in 77 brain cancer patients’ receiving 50 percent more radiation than prescribed in 2004 and 2005. The failure of medical facilities to properly commission new radiological equipment was cited as a concern last November by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

A testing service for institutions participating in National Cancer Institute trials recommends that certain newly installed radiotherapy equipment undergo an external, independent review before patients are treated. That did not occur at either Moffitt or CoxHealth.

CoxHealth said that so far it had not found any patients who had been harmed beyond the complications of routine radiation therapy. But patients are still being contacted. Some patients, who were seriously ill, have died, and the hospital is looking into those cases.

“The review of their charts and situation is still ongoing,” said Dr. John Duff, senior vice president for hospital operations. “It would be premature to speculate whether the overexposure was a contributing factor to their death.”

Dr. Duff said he did not know why the BrainLAB employee who was present while the new equipment was being installed had not caught the mistake. He said that the hospital did not have any reports from BrainLAB indicating a problem.

The physicist who incorrectly installed the equipment no longer works at the hospital. Officials there declined to explain the circumstances of his departure.

“It’s unacceptable to us that an error like this occurred, and we are taking steps to make sure that an error like this doesn’t happen again,” Mr. Bezanson said.

The hospital said its stereotactic system “remains suspended indefinitely while we are auditing the entire program.”

Kate Franco, a spokeswoman for BrainLAB, issued a statement Wednesday that said the company had assisted CoxHealth in figuring out what went wrong. “Reviews determined that BrainLAB equipment performed as designed and did not malfunction,” the statement said.
1662 2010-02-25 The mall operator General Growth Properties said on Wednesday that it would split into two companies as part of a plan to lift itself out of one of the largest real estate bankruptcy cases in corporate history. Under the plan, Brookfield Asset Management, a large real estate investment firm, would invest $2.63 billion.

The complex proposal is aimed at fending off an unsolicited $10 billion takeover bid by the country’s largest mall operator, the Simon Property Group. General Growth has rejected that bid as too low. Under its own plan, General Growth would remain independent, with Brookfield as one of its largest shareholders.

The announcement is the latest escalation in the clash between General Growth and Simon.

Simon, in its statement, derided General Growth’s plan as “a complex piece of financial engineering that is so highly conditional as to be illusory.”

The proposal will also pit General Growth investors against one another. One of the proposal’s main architects is the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who sits on General Growth’s board and owns big stakes in the company’s equity and debt, but the company’s unsecured creditors’ committee has raised objections to the plan.

It is unclear whether Simon will raise its offer, though it has been holding talks with potential partners like the Blackstone Group and sovereign wealth funds about co-investing in a joint deal, people briefed on the matter said.
1663 2010-02-25 A hedge fund manager in Florida who bilked millions of dollars from investors, then briefly disappeared as investigators closed in, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to securities fraud.

The fund manager, Arthur Nadel, 77, apologized for his conduct as he entered the plea before Judge John G. Koeltl of Federal District Court in Manhattan.

“I am profoundly sorry for what I have done,” he told the judge. He said he understood the rage of his victims, who had lost $162 million. “I want them all to know I will carry this burden with me every day for the rest of my life.”

Federal sentencing guidelines call for Mr. Nadel to serve as much as 24 years in prison. Sentencing is schedule for June.

Mr. Nadel has been in a federal jail since his arrest, unable to make bail, which was revoked Wednesday after he pleaded guilty.
1664 2010-02-25 Mr. McConnell, a five-term senator from Kentucky, has made an art form of backhandedly commending the president for his interpersonal skills — not unlike describing an unattractive date as having a “good personality.” Or, in the case of Mr. Obama, “an A-plus personality,” according to a recent gush from Mr. McConnell, who has also described the president as “fun to be around.” When asked for examples of “fun,” Mr. McConnell’s spokesman, Don Stewart, offered a cellphone call between Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell, who was shopping at a Kroger’s in Louisville (“They chatted about entitlements and the debt commission,” Mr. Stewart said.).

In turn, White House officials accuse Republicans of not listening to the president anyway. “They seem more interested in playing a role than actually establishing a dialogue,” said David Axelrod, a White House senior adviser.

Mr. Obama, who barely knew the leaders of the other party when he served in the Senate, seems to have lost any expectation that investing a lot of quality time with Republican leaders would help build a better relationship. (To wit: when asked in an interview what he would say to the president in a private meeting, Mr. Cantor said, “I would take the opportunity to press the president on why he thinks it’s better to ignore the public.”)

While no one believes that more movie nights at the White House could spur, say, Mr. Cantor to support the Obama health bill, there is a long political precedent for social interaction between adversaries greasing substantive alliances.

“The founders’ work was grounded in personal chemistry,” said Ted Widmer, a presidential historian at Brown University and former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. “They spent endless time together. They lived near each other in Philadelphia. They disagreed profoundly on things, but they all knew each other, and that helped.”

In the early days of his administration, Mr. Obama seemed committed to building camaraderie with Republicans. He initiated bipartisan “cocktail parties” a week after his inauguration, though none appeared on the president’s schedule after Feb. 4, 2009, according to the unofficial keeper of such data, Mark Knoller of CBS News. The president was host to four Republican lawmakers at a Super Bowl Party last year (but just one this year, Representative Ahn Cao of Louisiana, the only Republican in either chamber to support the health care bill).

Mr. Axelrod said the president was more than willing to engage the other party in both casual settings and policy discussions. According to the White House press office, 132 Republican members of Congress have attended White House social events with Mr. Obama, and more than 50 have had either group or individual sessions with him. Republican members have made more than 300 visits to the White House.

Top staff members and cabinet officials, including the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, routinely interact with top Republicans on the Hill, although the degree to which they do is also a point of dispute.

Mr. Boehner said last month that he had not spoken “in a year” to Mr. Emanuel, a former House colleague, to which the White House immediately responded by saying the men had spoken three times since November.

“Which means they say ‘Hi’ at the outset of a meeting,” quipped Mr. Boehner’s spokesman, Michael Steel.

Whatever. Mr. Obama and today’s Republican chiefs are a long way from the relative buddy act of Mr. Reagan and Mr. O’Neill, headstrong ideological opposites operating in the bitterly partisan swamp of the 1980s. Their harsh rhetoric might have suggested that they could not stand each other, but in fact, the congenial Irishmen spent significant private time together — and ultimately achieved a crucial bipartisan compromise on Social Security.

Even the publicly contentious relationship between President Clinton and the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, in the 1990s yielded regular private conversations — and eased the passage of a bill to overhaul the welfare system.

It is worth noting that both Mr. O’Neill and Mr. Gingrich led majorities in their respective houses — and thus enjoyed leverage that Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell do not. Even so, for whatever reason, Mr. Obama has yet to find such an across-the-aisle partner. It is not for lack of precedent in his case. He has often spoken of his close relations with the Republican Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, whom he worked with while in the Senate. Mr. Axelrod singled out Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as a potential ally and noted that the president has spoken extensively to Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, especially in trying to win her support for last year’s economic stimulus bill (successful) and health care legislation (not).

“The president himself has good chemistry with almost everyone,” said Mr. Axelrod, who pointed out that while Mr. Obama served in the Illinois State Senate, he played in a weekly poker game with mostly Republicans, “and not just because he wanted to take their money.”

Mr. Axelrod adds that the White House will continue to extend social invitations to Republicans, and that he would not foreclose on the possibility of a golf invitation one day to Mr. Boehner, a scratch player. If he does, Mr. Boehner would be the first Republican public official to join a presidential foursome since Mr. Obama took office, according to Mr. Knoller.

Scott Brown, the new Republican senator from Massachusetts, challenged Mr. Obama to a basketball game at the White House, to which the president seemed amenable. (The White House invited two Republican House members to participate in a much-hyped hoops game last October.) And there are indications that the White House — which just got 13 Republican votes to help pass a jobs bill — might be reinvigorating its efforts at bipartisan team-building since Mr. Brown’s election deprived Democrats of their 60-vote super-majority.

Mr. Coburn received a call from the president earlier this month about the possibility of working on a bill to adjust a disparity in sentencing between people who are arrested for possession of crack and those for crack-cocaine.

“We’re going to get this done,” Mr. Coburn said, noting that he never received a call about health care proposals. The president then invited him to come by the White House in the near future, “just to visit,” Mr. Coburn said.

1666 2010-02-25 Mr. Tepper said that he did not want to take over the complexes so much as he wanted to stop CW Capital from acting in a “reckless” manner.

It was unclear, Appaloosa said, whether debt holders would be liable for more than $200 million in rent rebates. Last year, New York’s highest court ruled that the owners had improperly converted 4,400 apartments to market rates.

The sale of Stuyvesant Town, as well as hundreds of other “meat-and-potato” apartment buildings in the city, set off a hue and cry during the residential housing boom from tenants and elected officials about the loss of affordable housing. That loss has become even more palpable as many of these highly leveraged deals unraveled when property values plummeted.

“The fact that these investors so grossly overleveraged these buildings is a symptom of the larger economic crisis that we’re all dealing with now,” said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development. “The fact that some of these players are trying to further maximize their profit, again at the expense of affordable housing in the city, is pretty horrifying.”

Although rents at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village only covered about two-thirds of the debt service on the $3 billion mortgage, Tishman Speyer and BlackRock had planned on increasing profits by converting rent stabilized apartments to market rates. But their plan failed, and the property is now worth an estimated $1.8 billion.

“The tenants are not in favor of prolonged legal wrangling,” said Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who has lived in the complexes all his life. “We don’t think it will be helpful to extend the process here by fighting among the creditor parties.”

Appaloosa, which has asked the court to allow it to intervene in the matter, also claims that CW Capital has “irreconcilable conflicts of interest” because it is both the “servicer” for the mortgage and a key debt holder.

The $3 billion Stuyvesant Town mortgage was combined with mortgages from other properties and sold to many investors as a commercial mortgage-backed security. But some debt holders have a higher standing for getting paid than others, which can become a major point of contention if the property is worth less than the mortgage.

Mr. Tepper, whose company has acquired control of more than $750 million of $3 billion in mortgages held by five separate trusts, said in an interview Wednesday that he wanted CW Capital to fulfill its fiduciary interest to debt holders to maximize recovery of the mortgage. He said his company was surprised by CW Capital’s sudden decision to foreclose.

“We actually want them to do what they’re supposed to do,” Mr. Tepper said of CW Capital. “We’re trying to uphold our rights.”

Appaloosa made a profit of about $7 billion last year, including $2.5 billion for Mr. Tepper. His firm has been recently focused on buying debt at a steep discount that is backed by loans on properties like Stuyvesant Town, although he said he had first acquired some of the Stuyvesant Town debt in 2008. The more money that debt holders get for the property in a resale, the bigger his profit.

Mr. Tepper said his interests were not “at odds” with those of tenants. “We recognize the fact that at some point, there needs to be some degree of rent controlled apartments there,” he said.

While the most recent appraisal put the value of the complexes at about $1.8 billion, many analysts and investors say that over time the complexes, which contain more than 11,000 apartments, will be worth far more.

Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has been active on behalf of the tenants, said Wednesday: “We must avoid going back to the future and having any new buyer overpay for the complex that leaves tenants with an uncertain future, and we can’t have that. The bottom line is we must protect current and future tenants and preserve Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village as havens for the middle class.”

The Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association is pursuing a plan that would allow some tenants to buy their apartments, while ensuring that thousands of other units stay affordable under the state’s rent rules.
1667 2010-02-25 Justice Scalia said the main reason to forbid repeated attempts at questioning was to prevent badgering of a suspect held in custody while a crime was under investigation. He added that voluntary confessions were “an unmitigated good” and that suspects were always free to invoke their Miranda rights again when approached for further questioning.

Taken to an extreme, Justice Scalia added, the prohibition on further attempts at questioning would confer a sort of immunity on suspects who had once invoked their rights — even if the subsequent questioning concerned another crime in another jurisdiction.

The court could have answered only the question directly presented in Mr. Shatzer’s case — whether a gap of more than two years was sufficient to allow further efforts at questioning. In a concurrence endorsing the result but declining to adopt the majority’s reasoning, Justice John Paul Stevens said that was the route he would have taken.

But in a move that Justice Scalia conceded was “certainly unusual,” the justices in the majority picked a specific time period — 14 days after release from custody — after which the police could restart their efforts.

That ruling did not dispose of the case, Maryland v. Shatzer, No. 08-680, because Mr. Shatzer was, in one sense, in custody throughout. The majority ruled that a prison sentence was not custody in the relevant sense and that a return to the general prison population after questioning amounted to a break in custody for the purposes of Miranda and Edwards.

Justice Clarence Thomas joined only that last part of the decision. In his concurrence, Justice Thomas called the 14-day time limit arbitrary, saying that “0, 10 or 100 days” would have been equally plausible. He suggested that any break in custody was enough to let attempts at questioning resume.

Justice Scalia said that a bright-line 14-day rule provided valuable guidance to law enforcement officials. He added that two weeks provided “plenty of time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody.”

Justice Stevens, in his concurrence, was skeptical about those assertions. “The court gives no reason for that speculation,” he wrote, adding that it “may well prove inaccurate in many circumstances.”

The court also issued a Miranda-related decision on Tuesday. In Florida v. Powell, No. 08-1175, justices ruled that the police in Tampa, Fla., were entitled to give Miranda warnings that varied from the formula familiar to fans of television crime dramas. The alternative warnings used in Tampa told suspects about their right to consult a lawyer before questioning but did not in so many words tell them that they had a right to have the lawyer present during the questioning.
1668 2010-02-25 When the concerts began, Mr. Glass said in an interview at Tibet House’s headquarters in Manhattan, Tibet was far below the radar of most Americans, and Tibetan refugees had trouble assimilating into American society. “You had men who had spent their lives studying religious texts wrapping packages at Macy’s,” he said.

Since then the Tibetan cause has become a regular topic of American public discourse, and the Dalai Lama a familiar face around the world. In 1989 he won the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a regular presence in the mainstream news media; this week he was interviewed on NPR and on “Larry King Live” on CNN. He may be dressed in robes and sandals, but his organization is tech-savvy: on Monday an official Dalai Lama Twitter account began sending out regular news updates.

The concerts, which celebrate the Tibetan New Year (Feb. 14 this year), raise $100,000 to $250,000 each year, according to Tibet House, a nonprofit group founded at the Dalai Lama’s request in 1987. Most of that money supports Tibet House, but some of it is also sent to other Tibetan groups in the United States.

As Professor Thurman sees it, the visibility of the concerts and the Dalai Lama’s example of nonviolence have drawn worldwide sympathy for the Tibetan cause and put pressure on the Chinese government to reconcile.

“The Chinese desperately need spirituality,” he said. “They would benefit from the Dalai Lama’s representations and his walking the talk of Buddhist ethics. So as a peacemaker and as a religious leader he likes to have a hand in China.”

Mr. Glass is not as sanguine about the political solution, and he points out that the mission of Tibet House is strictly cultural. Its small office is filled with centuries-old tapestries and contemporary paintings and sculptures that have been donated by artists and collectors. Ganden Thurman, Tibet House US’s executive director and a son of Robert Thurman, said the organization relied on donations from artists and collectors because corporations eager for Chinese trade are often skittish about publicly supporting a Tibetan cause. (Tibet House is a Thurman family enterprise: Professor Thurman’s wife, Nena, and one of his daughters, the actress Uma Thurman, are on its board.)

Instead, Mr. Glass said the concerts represented the survival of Tibetan culture in a changed world and its gradual embrace as part of the fabric of American society.

“It might be a slightly cruel thing to say,” he said, “but we’ve been the beneficiaries of an exiled community, as we have been with the Italians, and with the Ukrainians, or the Jewish people, or the African cultures that came here through slavery. America is a very dynamic and vital place and partly because of our ability to absorb these kinds of things.”

The concerts “began as a kind of beacon — ‘Here we are, don’t forget us,’ ” he added. “Now it’s like a celebration of a culture which is surviving in a way no one expected it would.”
1669 2010-02-25 LONDON — A parliamentary committee on Wednesday accused News International of having exhibited “collective amnesia” in an inquiry about how its News of the World tabloid hacked into the telephones of members of the royal family, celebrities and other public figures.

“We have repeatedly encountered an unwillingness to provide the detailed information that we sought, claims of ignorance or lack of recall, and deliberate obfuscation,” the panel, known as the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said in a report.

News International, the main British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which also publishes The Times of London and the tabloid The Sun, condemned the report as biased and said the committee was following a “party-political agenda.”

The report, “Press Standards, Privacy and Libel,” is a broad examination of issues relating to the way the British news media operate. But it reserves a large chunk of opprobrium for executives from The News of the World and News International, many of whom gave evidence as the committee sought to investigate the hacking charges.

The inquiry stemmed from an episode in 2007 in which Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, and Clive Goodman, the royal correspondent for The News of the World, were convicted of unlawfully intercepting messages from a number of people’s telephones. Victims included aides to the royal family, the model Elle MacPherson, the publicist Max Clifford and the Liberal Democratic politician Simon Hughes.
1670 2010-02-25 A delightful first act gives way to a muddled Act II in “Yank!,” a musical about a gay romance during World War II. But if the overall package doesn’t quite work, this stuffed-to-the-brim show certainly goes out of its way to include something for everybody: two tap numbers, a ballet, rousing songs of camaraderie, sentimental ballads, bare backsides, guys in formal gowns. With all that’s going on, you hardly even notice the accidental topicality.

“Yank!,” first seen at the New York Musical Theater Festival in 2005, is being staged this time around by the York Theater Company, which has assembled a solid cast led by Bobby Steggert as Stu, who enters the Army at 18, still uncertain of his sexuality. He goes to work for the Army magazine Yank, but not before meeting Mitch (Ivan Hernandez), a hunky fellow soldier who befriends him and ultimately becomes more than a friend (though remaining in denial even as their relationship heats up).

“Yank!,” with music by Joseph Zellnik and book and lyrics by David Zellnik, his brother, of course has an added resonance because of the current debate over whether to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. But this is hardly a political show. Its subtitle, “A WWII Love Story,” encapsulates its main aspiration: to depict a same-sex couple as so many heterosexual couples have been shown over the years, struggling to capture the elusive thing called love against a backdrop of grand events.

In pursuit of that goal, the writers deliberately traffic in clichés, following the blueprint of countless musicals and war movies of the 1940s or thereabouts. The gimmick works well for most of the way, especially when the cast’s lone woman, the versatile Nancy Anderson in an absurdity of multiple roles, sings the kind of slow number that many screen and stage heterosexual couples have kissed to. Here, it’s Stu and Mitch doing the kissing; the effect is sublime.

Ultimately, though, the commitment to emulating those old musicals derails a show that had been moving along nicely: a dreamlike ballet is thrown in near the end, killing the momentum. A few other poor choices in the final act are also disruptive. It begins to feel as if the writers and the director, Igor Goldin, had some kind of grab bag they needed to empty before they could wrap things up.

Until these missteps, the show has a fine mix of humor and simmering drama and decent enough songs to keep you anticipating the next one. Probably a few too many themes are introduced and left underexplored — fidelity in gay relationships, for example, and personal loyalty versus respect for military codes. The show would be better if it were less ambitious.
1671 2010-02-25 The increases in premiums are driven by prices charged by doctors, hospitals, drug companies and other suppliers, and by increases in the use of health care by an aging population, Ms. Braly said.

“For 2010,” Ms. Braly said, “we expect hospital inpatient and outpatient costs in California to grow by over 10 percent, driven primarily by hospital reimbursement rates. Additionally, we expect pharmacy costs in California to grow by over 13 percent.”

Ms. Braly said health care providers were charging more to the private sector, “including our members,” because payments from Medicare and Medicaid did not fully cover providers’ costs.

Families with commercial insurance pay almost $1,800 a year more for coverage as a result of this cost shift, Ms. Braly said.

She criticized health care bills passed by the House and the Senate, with strong support from Mr. Obama. The bills would require insurers to accept all applicants and would require most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty.

But Ms. Braly said the “personal coverage requirement” would not be fully effective, because millions of people would be exempted and others would make a “logical choice” to pay the penalty rather than buy insurance, unless they needed health care.

“The result,” she said, “will be a national health insurance market that is similar to New York, where the average individual market premium is over twice the average individual premium in California.”

Ms. Braly said the legislation pending in Congress “would increase California individual market premiums for the young and healthy by as much as 106 percent, before premium subsidies for certain eligible individuals” are taken into account.

Democrats have said insurers are raking in large profits while raising premiums. But Ms. Braly said profits accounted for “a very small percentage of a member’s premium.”

Another witness invited to the hearing, Lauren Meister of West Hollywood, Calif., said she was told in January that her Anthem Blue Cross premium was being increased 38 percent, to $516 a month, from $373.

Ms. Meister said she was offered the option of switching to a lower-cost Anthem plan that covered only generic versions of prescription drugs. But she said that was not feasible because she took several brand-name drugs for asthma.

In her prepared testimony, Ms. Meister called for more regulation.

“We saw what deregulation did to the cost of utilities in California,” Ms. Meister said. “We saw what the lack of regulation has done on a national level to our financial and banking system. Well, it’s doing the same thing to our health care system.”

Ms. Meister added: “The City of West Hollywood, where I live, regulates how much landlords can raise the rent each year to keep rents stabilized. Why can’t the federal government regulate how much health insurance companies can raise their rates per year, in order to stabilize premiums?”
1672 2010-02-25 A pledge from the chairman of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low helped galvanize the equity markets on Wednesday, soothing concerns that the economy would be deprived of a critical crutch as it struggled to recover.

For all the politics accompanying Ben S. Bernanke’s semiannual report to Congress, the ears of the financial world were largely attuned to one point: the forecast on interest rates. Mr. Bernanke lived up to expectations, assuring lawmakers repeatedly that short-term rates would remain near zero “for an extended period.”

In response, stocks surged, with the Dow Jones industrial average briefly posting triple-digit gains.

“There was always this lingering doubt, but now we know it’s nowhere near — not even close to — the beginning of the tightening,” said Douglas S. Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. “It was a sigh of relief.”

The enthusiasm was enough to overcome a disappointing report on the housing market.

Investors had been nervous that the Fed’s recent move to raise the rate that it charges banks on short-term loans — known as the discount rate — might be a prelude to tighter monetary policy.

1687 2010-02-26 VANCOUVER, British Columbia - After months of playing it cool, saying the pressure to win the Olympic gold medal had not weighed on her, Kim Yu-na of South Korea finally let her emotion show on Thursday.

For the first time, she stood on the ice after her performance and felt her lips start to quiver. As flowers and stuffed toys rained down from the stands, her tears began to flow.

“I can’t believe this day has finally come for me,” said Kim, who was taken aback by her own crying.

That emotional release, so long in the making, quickly ended as soon as Kim, the reigning world champion in women’s figure skating, got a glimpse of her score.

When the numbers 150.06 popped up on the scoreboard, her mouth dropped open in delight. It was a world record, which had broken her old record by a whopping 16.11 points. Though her longtime rival Mao Asada had yet to skate, Kim had all but clinched the gold medal. She had made herself untouchable.

For her two unforgettable, nearly perfect performances at these Olympics, the 19-year-old Kim had scored a record total of 228.56 points, more than 23 points ahead of her nearest pursuer.

As the eyes of her home country focused on her, Kim, the most famous celebrity there, became South Korea’s first Olympic champion in figure skating. Before Kim’s victory, her country hadn’t won a medal in any Winter Olympic event but speedskating.

“I still can’t believe the score that I received,” Kim said. “I’m really surprised. It’s almost as close as the men’s score.”

Asada, the 2008 world champion, won the silver, with 205.50 over all. Joannie Rochette, skating just four days after her mother’s sudden death, won the bronze. She received 202.64 points over all.

Mirai Nagasu, the 2008 United States national champion, was fourth, with 190.15 points. Rachael Flatt, the reigning national champion, was seventh, with 182.49.

While each of those skaters had moments of brilliance, Kim - who skated to Gershwin’s “Concerto in F” - was the only one to have an entire four minutes of it.

Wearing a royal blue dressed that fluttered in the wind, she sped atop the ice, seamlessly incorporating triple jumps into her complex routine, as if it were as natural as breathing. Her complicated footwork left gigantic, loopy scribbles all over the ice, but as she moved, she appeared to be floating. She punctuated the entire routine with a sweet smile.

At the end, the crowd leaped to its feet to celebrate her, drowning out the announcer’s every word. And Asada was the unfortunate skater who had to follow that.

Performing right after Kim’s monumental marks appeared, Asada tried to hold herself together, but her focus began to chip away as each note of Rachmaninoff’s “Bells of Moscow” played. One of her jumps - the triple flip - received a downgrade, meaning she failed to complete enough of the rotation. Then, as she prepared for a triple toe loop, her skate nicked the ice. She singled that jump. She had landed two triple axels, but even those jumps, which are rare for women, could not help her.

When she was done, her face appeared blank. She and Kim had been rivals since they were junior skaters, with all their previous performances building up to these Games. Here, Asada was thought to be the only skater who could challenge Kim for the gold medal.

“I did everything I can,” Asada said. “To complete both triple axels well at the Olympics was one good thing about my performance. But I am not happy with the rest of my performance. I do feel regretful.”

Rochette, the 2009 silver medalist at the world championships, was expected to contend for the silver or bronze. She was hoping to become the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic medal since Elizabeth Manley won the silver at the 1988 Calgary Games.

Her quest for a spot on the podium, however, was overshadowed by the events that unfolded in the wee hours of Sunday morning when her mother, Therese Rochette, died of a massive heart attack. Therese Rochette, whom Joannie called her “No. 1 fan,” was 55.

Skating to “Samson and Delilah” and with the crowd behind her, Joannie Rochette had some troubles on her triple flip, triple lutz and a double axel combination. She had come close to winning the silver medal, but took a bronze after a week of raw emotion and grief.

“I feel so proud, and the result didn’t matter,” Rochette said. “But I’m happy to be on the podium. That was my goal here. It’s been a lifetime project with my mom, and we achieved that.”

As the flags of the medal winners rose high above the ice during the victory ceremony, one was conspicuously missing: the American flag. For the first time since 1964, an American woman did not win a figure skating medal at the Winter Games.

The expectations were low for the team’s two competitors here, Flatt and Nagasu, because no American female skater has won a medal at the past three world championships. But the two tried their best to keep the medal streak going.
1688 2010-02-26 Eighty percent believed they were prepared to make ethical decisions when they joined the work force. Of that group, nearly half said that lying to parents or guardians was O.K., and 61 percent said they had done so in the last year. More than a third of respondents thought that “you have to break the rules at school to succeed.”

“Where does Blago differ from these kids?” Mr. Kidder asked. “That, of course, is the risk.”

Paraphrasing the political sage created by the late cartoonist Walt Kelly, Pogo, Mr. Kidder said we have met the enemy, and he is our children.

Jeffrey Seglin, a columnist who writes about ethics, acerbically wondered if Mr. Blagojevich considered himself more of a Kantian, Aristotelian or Utilitarian in his approach to ethical decisions. And, then, Mr. Seglin asked, “This is the best they could do?”

Mr. Seglin said he shared Northwestern’s announcement with colleagues, one of whom responded, “I suppose Eliot Spitzer speaking at Harvard’s Safra Foundation Center for Ethics will be next. Oh wait, that happened last fall.”

But there was a contrarian view from Larry Miller, a comic who occasionally writes about politics.

“There are so many shatteringly immoral thieves and cutthroats in government today, yesterday and tomorrow, so many in Chicago and Illinois and New York and Texas and Montana, so many galloping egomaniacs who just haven’t been caught yet, so many roaches zipping around the kitchen floor before someone turns out the light, why not Blagojevich,” said Mr. Miller, who recently appeared in Las Vegas with his chum Jerry Seinfeld.

Mr. Miller, who as an actor has played some awful, ethically challenged souls on “Law and Order,” rather hyperbolically said: “You and I don’t want to live like this, but it’s not too cynical to say, ‘They are all like this.’ In theory, O.K., there’s one guy here, and one woman there, who are actually trustworthy. But isn’t it axiomatic that as soon as one of these horrible egomaniacs first decides to run for something, anything, that it’s irrefutable proof-positive the guy’s a complete lunatic and thug?”

His grand finale: “Why not Blagojevich speaking on ethics? At least that has humor. Is it not far worse and creepy to have Hugo Chávez or Ahmadinejad welcome at the United Nations? These are seriously bad people, and we all stand and applaud and nod as if we were about to listen to U Thant,” the former U.N. secretary general.

Mr. Miller said he would rather take his moral lessons from the former governor.

“At least he’s a homegrown, American thief,” he said. “Plus, he’s smart enough to never stop dancing until they drag him away. Hell, good for him. As long as the truly horrible people of the world strut onto world stages like a decent person, let Rod be Rod.”

The “Death of Irony” will presumably continue with the imminent arrival of the NBC series “Celebrity Apprentice,” on which Mr. Blagojevich is a desperately willing co-star.

And sometime after that, the federal courthouse in Chicago will turn into a daily reality series, with our born-again ethicist in the dock, facing the prospect of trading his well-tailored threads for a prison jumpsuit.

One hopes the Northwestern students read all about it.
1689 2010-02-26 The Cubs, as we know, have not won a World Series in 101 years or played in one in 65. Yet the team keeps asking its fans to invest in hope and dig deeper while they are stretched to cover the necessities of real life.

Ricketts, a Cubs fan long before he was an owner, said that his own ticket-buying experience involved plying his brother with beer and pizza to get him to stand in line for bleacher seats. But as the sons of a billionaire, they never had to sweat the cost.

He has said all the right things about respecting Cubs history and tradition and honoring the almost sacred trust. He hears from fans who wistfully recall when they were 8 years old, attending their first game with their grandfathers, mesmerized by the lush green setting and the majestic scoreboard and getting hooked on the Cubs forever.

Ricketts understands that the ballpark experience is essential to cultivating loyalty. But beer and sunshine and socializing are no longer enough — not at these prices. For all their success at the gate, the Cubs are chronic underachievers on the field, and it’s no longer cute or funny. Not at these prices.

Marc Whitney, 44, is a Chicago native, a lifelong Cubs fan who indulged his youthful passion by working as an Andy Frain usher at Wrigley Field and seeing 40-plus games a year. Now living in Milwaukee, he is trying to raise his son in the religion and has been making two or three Cubs trips a year. But, after paying $215.67 online for three right-field-corner, upper-deck box seats to a Friday afternoon game against the Phillies in July, the Whitney family will be making only one Wrigley trip this year. The face value of those tickets is $156; the additional cost comes from taxes and the “convenience fee” the Cubs charged in the pre-sale.

Similar seats would also cost $156 at a Fenway Park ticket booth, and no wonder — the Red Sox are the Ricketts’s role model for their baseball business. There are similarities between the Cubs and the Red Sox, beginning with their cozy, neighborhood ballparks, each a shrine-like attraction unto itself as a symbol of history, of baseball as it was meant to be played.

There are also significant differences, beginning with on-field performance. The Red Sox have been to the playoffs in seven of the last eight years and won the World Series in 2004 and 2007. The Cubs are poster guys for baseball futility, with a 1-6 record in postseason series since their last pennant in 1945 and with a nine-game playoff losing streak. And they have a thriving, less expensive rival just eight miles to the south that would be primed to steal market share if baseball loyalty weren’t so deeply ingrained in Chicago.

“This has always mystified me: The White Sox play in a newer, nicer park with better amenities, more parking and frequently a better team,” said Marc Ganis, a sports marketing consultant. “Yet they draw, on average, 40 percent fewer fans. That’s the power of Wrigley Field.”

That power comes at an increasingly steep price. Maybe too steep.
1690 2010-02-26 The Maryland Senate on Thursday approved a ban on the chemical bisphenol A in bottles and cups for children under 4. In a 46-to-0 vote, the Senate passed legislation identical to a bill that already has cleared the House of Delegates. The measures were amended so the ban would not apply to toys and teething rings. The ban will take effect in 2012, a year later than initially proposed. Shaun Adamec, a spokesman for Gov. Martin O’Malley, said the governor planned to sign the legislation. Connecticut and Minnesota passed similar laws last year.
1691 2010-02-26 A former Ku Klux Klansman convicted in the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers has sued the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mississippi’s attorney general, claiming they conspired to suppress his rights to “defend his society and culture.” Edgar Ray Killen, a former saw mill operator and onetime preacher, is serving a 60-year sentence after his 2005 manslaughter convictions in the deaths of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman. The federal lawsuit, filed Wednesday, seeks millions of dollars in damages and a declaration that his rights were violated when the F.B.I. allegedly used a gangster during its investigation. An F.B.I. spokeswoman had no comment.
1692 2010-02-26 Pepsi is planning to give more than $20 million to charities through a contest called Pepsi Refresh, the most ambitious so far among a number of similar contests that have used social networks on the Internet to raise money and recognition for nonprofit groups and social causes.

But, like some of its predecessors, Pepsi Refresh has stumbled over its own rules.

The tiny charity currently atop the rankings in one category of the contest accidentally got a little help from Pepsi itself.

Materials submitted by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a charity started by Mariska Hargitay, one of the stars of “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” to help victims of sexual assault, were updated by the staff at Pepsi after the submission deadline, which is against the contest rules.

That upset some of the contestants who wondered whether Pepsi was doing favors for a celebrity. “I can’t edit my own submission, so how did she do it?” said one contestant, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his chances of winning.

Just an honest mistake, says Pepsi. “We didn’t follow our guidelines to the letter,” said Jill Beraud, chief marketing officer for the American beverages unit at Pepsi. “The bottom line is that we’ve learned from this and we’re moving on.”
1693 2010-02-26 TORONTO (AP) — The newsprint manufacturer White Birch Paper Company has filed for bankruptcy protection, citing declining demand for newspapers and the strength of the Canadian dollar.

The company’s United States unit, the Bear Island Paper Company, filed a Chapter 11 petition in Richmond, Va., on Wednesday. It listed assets of $100 million to $500 million and debt of $500 million to $1 billion in the court documents.

The parent company filed its papers in Quebec, under Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, in an attempt, it says, to preserve the value of its business and improve its capital structure.

The Canadian companies are also filing petitions for protection in the United States under Chapter 15, which deals with cross-border insolvency.

The company, one of the largest newsprint manufacturers in North America, is seeking approval in Canada and the United States for 140 million Canadian dollars ($132 million) in financing while in bankruptcy that it has already secured from lenders.
1694 2010-02-26 And we have a winner! Apple announced on Thursday that Louie Sulcer of Woodstock, Ga., clicked the “Buy Song” button at an opportune time, downloading the 10 billionth song from the company’s iTunes Store since the site went active in April 2003. Mr. Sulcer will receive a $10,000 iTunes gift card for his fortuitous purchase of Johnny Cash’s “Guess Things Happen That Way.” Mr. Sulcer, a 71-year-old retired real estate broker, said in an interview that he learned about his achievement when Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, called on Wednesday night. On Thursday he heard from Rosanne Cash, Johnny Cash’s daughter, who thanked him for buying one of her father’s tunes. She then put her husband, the musician John Leventhal, on the phone to play the winning song. Mr. Sulcer said he hadn’t had much time to think about how he would spend the winnings. “That’s the $10,000 question,” he said, though he said he expects that his three children and nine grandchildren would most likely benefit. “I don’t think I’ll have to worry about buying birthday and Christmas presents anytime soon.”
1695 2010-02-26 He comes honestly by both. Born in Johannesburg in 1955, he grew up under the corrosive pall of apartheid, the son of two lawyers who were prominent opponents of the system. Although he studied art, he first worked in theater, as a writer, director, set designer, puppeteer and actor. By the late 1970s he was making prints and drawings; the earliest work at the Modern is a 1979 monotype from a series titled “Pit” — a word that connotes both theater architecture and torture. Nonetheless, in the early 1980s, he spent a year in Paris studying mime.

Mr. Kentridge’s eureka moment arrived late in that decade. At a time when Neo-Expressionists like Anselm Kiefer and Jörg Immendorff were stirring up the ghosts of Nazism, Mr. Kentridge devised his signature brand of animation — a kind of filmic Neo-Expressionism — and aimed it at apartheid. Between 1989 and 2003 he made a series of nine short films that he eventually gathered under the title “9 Drawings for Projection.” They are being screened continuously in three large galleries. (The sixth of these films, “History of the Main Complaint,” from 1996, was seen at Documenta X the following year and set Mr. Kentridge on the path to international art stardom.)

In the “9 Drawings” series, image making and storytelling, the personal and the political combine and recombine, often to cataclysmic effect, dazzling the eye with flurries of charcoal marks and erasures. All is mutation, metamorphosis, change and upheaval. Nothing is still, not land, objects, faces or emotions, and not the artist’s presence, which is never seen but is felt everywhere.

As the images coalesce and disintegrate, the tortured story of Soho Eckstein — a wealthy industrialist who resembles Mr. Kentridge more than faintly and often appears as a pinstriped mountain of gluttony, greed and guilt — unfolds against a tumultuous backdrop. Crowds protest, bombs explode, water rises, buildings fall, miners descend into mines followed by the plunger from Soho’s French-press coffee maker; people mourn or pine or embrace.

In “Stereoscope,” the series’s eighth and possibly strongest film, Soho sits at his desk looking at a framed photograph of his wife, who comes to life and couples with her lover, Felix Teitelbaum, all within the frame. Crowds gather outside Eckstein House, his office building, which eventually disintegrates in a cloud of charcoal dust. At the end Soho stands alone in a room, head bowed. He cries himself a bright blue river that rises to his knees. The message fuses hope and despair: Nothing is stable, all that is done can be undone.

This exhibition has nice succinctness. It does not attempt to account for the full range of Mr. Kentridge’s output, but it traces a kind of progression away from and back to political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio.

The show begins with two sections of antiapartheid works. “Ubu and the Procession” centers on two short dark nightmarish films made in a rush in the late ’90s and is accompanied by some of the show’s best works on paper from that time. Inspired by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that South Africa established to sort out the crimes of the apartheid era, the films highlight Mr. Kentridge’s improvisational skills.

For “Ubu Tells the Truth” (1997) he brings the demented despot of Alfred Jarry’s plays to vivid life using both hand-drawn animation and an actor shown in black silhouette. “Shadow Procession” (1999) features all kinds of people on the move, displaced refugees or hopeful emigrants, plus glimpses of the Kentridge family cat. Some figures are real, others are rendered in continually rearranged bits of torn black paper — a kind of unhinged collage process — that is remarkably realistic.

The “9 Drawings for Projection” are the focus of “Thick Time: Soho and Felix,” the show’s second section. They are the strongest film works in the show, although today their existential angst seems more pressing than their political anger.

The show’s third section, “The Artist in the Studio,” stars Mr. Kentridge as a sometimes melancholy sorcerer, withdrawn from politics and demonstrating one bit of drawing-into-film magic after another. What is at hand is pressed into service: an espresso pot, for example, as the spaceship in a homage to the pioneering filmmaker Georges Méliès and his 1902 film “A Trip to the Moon.” Running film in reverse yields several art-making jokes. A negative image of ants lured before the camera with sugar reads like a teaming galaxy of white specks on black.

The enthralling effects continue in the gallery dominated by two puppet-theater film installations derived from Mr. Kentridge’s work on the “Magic Flute,” as the musical scores, good throughout the show, ramp up with Mozart. The larger installation, “Black Box,” is a dark yet almost lyrical indictment of colonialism, with wrenching use made of drawings, vintage film of white hunters and of mechanized puppets that move with eerie resonance. On the walls several large drawings of landscapes framed by prosceniums suggest that Mr. Kentridge might do well to give the figure a rest.

The show’s final gallery is devoted to “I Am Not Me, the Horse Is Not Mine,” a seven-projection installation inspired by “The Nose” and accompanied by Philip Miller’s blaring, sardonic music. It is an unkempt work turning on devastating passages from the show trial of Nikolai Bukharin during the Stalinist purges of the late 1930s. It feels like a work in progress, and not nearly as finished as a live version performed by Mr. Kentridge as part of Performa 09 last fall that will be staged on Thursday at the Modern. But the mixture of styles and historic references leaves Mr. Kentridge in a good place, reconnecting with the urgency of real events and very much in motion.
1696 2010-02-26 While such legal tangles would surely have ended political careers elsewhere, Mr. Berlusconi has always managed to stay one step ahead of his trials. Many Italians agree with his frequent accusations that magistrates are left-wing and on a witch hunt against him.

Analysts said the latest ruling took pressure off the center-right leader to push through Parliament a series of justice reforms that he has been championing since October, when Italy’s highest court declared unconstitutional a law granting him immunity from prosecution.

While a majority of Italians believe Italy’s sclerotic judicial system is in dire need of reform, many see Mr. Berlusconi’s proposals as aimed more at protecting his own personal and political fortunes.

On Thursday, a leading opposition politician, Antonio Di Pietro, called the ruling by the Supreme Court, whose formal name is the Court of Cassation, “a disgrace.” Mr. Di Pietro added that if someone was bribed, “then there’s also a briber,” according to the ANSA news agency.

“In a normal country, the prime minister would have already resigned,” he said.

In a statement, Mr. Mills, 65, the estranged husband of the British Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, said he was “relieved that this saga has finally now come to an end.” He has always said he is innocent.

While Mr. Mills will not have to serve his sentence of four years and six months, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling requiring him to pay $337,000 in damages.

The original prosecutors in the case contended that the clock on the statute of limitations began running in February 2000, when Mr. Mills received the money, while lawyers for Mr. Mills and Mr. Berlusconi argued that it started in 1999, when Mr. Mills agreed to receive the money.

In a trial that began in 2006, prosecutors said Mr. Mills had failed to tell a court that two offshore companies involved in buying United States film rights had links to Mr. Berlusconi. They also said Mr. Mills failed to mention a 1995 telephone call with Mr. Berlusconi in which they say the two discussed payments from Mr. Berlusconi to the Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who died in 2000.

Italian prosecutors began investigating Mr. Mills in 2004 after a tip from the authorities in London, where Mr. Mills’s accountant had raised concerns.

Mr. Mills had earlier written to the accountant, Bob Drennan, about the tax status of a payment he received. “I told no lies, but I turned some very tricky corners, to put it mildly, and so kept Mr. B. out of a great deal of trouble he would have been in had I said all I knew,” he said, according to a widely published copy of the letter.

Mr. Mills first told prosecutors that the letter was accurate. He later retracted his statement.
1697 2010-02-26 MOSCOW — A lead investigator in the murder of Natalya Estemirova, a human rights worker who was abducted and shot to death in Chechnya last July, said on Thursday that the authorities know who shot her but that they have been unable to arrest the suspect.

Igor Sobol, head of investigations at the investigative committee for the Southern Federal District prosecutor’s office, confirmed an account given anonymously to the Interfax news service on Thursday. He said the gun used to kill Ms. Estemirova had been found in a weapons cache, and that there are “objective grounds to identify a group of people” behind her killing.

He said the authorities could not arrest the suspect because he was in hiding, and said he could give no more information out of fear of harming the investigation. An employee at the prosecutor general’s office in Moscow said there would be no comment on the matter.

The murder of Ms. Estemirova, one of the most respected human rights workers in the North Caucasus, drew international condemnation. Seven months have passed with no arrest, and foreign leaders have repeatedly pressed Moscow to find her killers.

1705 2010-02-27 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee on Friday proposed creating a Bureau of Financial Protection inside the Treasury Department to regulate mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and other consumer products.

The proposal, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times, represents an attempt at compromise by the chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, on the issue that has been the greatest source of discord over the regulatory overhaul. It was not clear whether the Republicans on the committee would go along, and aides to Mr. Dodd could not be reached for comment Friday evening.

According to the proposal, Mr. Dodd has agreed to house the new bureau within the Treasury — as opposed to creating a standalone agency, as the Obama administration had sought — but insisted that the bureau have a director appointed by the president, a dedicated budget comprised of assessments on large banks and nonbank lenders, and authority to adopt regulations.

Banking groups have lobbied against the proposal for the agency, which was part of the House version of the regulatory package, adopted in December. Opponents say the agency would interfere with the duty of regulators to ensure the “safety and soundness” of banks.

The Dodd proposal would require the bureau to consult with other regulators before issuing rules and to make public any objections raised by those regulators, along with an explanation of how the bureau addressed the concerns. Those regulators also could appeal the proposed rule to a new interagency council tasked with detecting systemic risks.

The proposal would exempt banks and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or less. It would give the bureau the power to enforce regulations on large banks and nonbank lenders, in conjunction with other regulators, but would largely have to defer to other regulators in the case of smaller banks.
1706 2010-02-27 A Pakistani court on Friday barred the government from sending captured Afghan Taliban leaders abroad, a day after Afghanistan said Pakistan had agreed in principle to hand over a militant commander. Pakistan has captured at least four top Taliban members in recent weeks, including the No. 2 leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Afghanistan said Thursday that Pakistan had agreed to hand over Mullah Baradar. But an Islamist activist filed a petition in a Lahore court expressing concern that the captives would be extradited to the United States. The court blocked the extradition of five people, including Mullah Baradar.
1707 2010-02-27 As the mother of a teenage leukemia survivor, I have witnessed firsthand the frightening proliferation of certain cancers in children, as mentioned by Mr. Kristof. I’m convinced that if Capitol Hill took a personal tour of a pediatric oncology clinic, and observed the terrified parents struggling with strollers, pacifiers, I.V. poles and critically ill children, our government would legislate chemical safety more aggressively in a heartbeat.

My pediatrician hangs a provocative lithograph in his office with the banner phrase “The Health of Our Children Is the Power of Our Nation.” What are we waiting for?

Nicholas D. Kristof’s column provides an important insight into the broader topic of chemicals and health.

For example, a recent report by the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coalition estimates that reducing exposure to toxic chemicals by even a small fraction could shave more than $5 billion a year off the nation’s health care costs for learning disabilities, childhood cancer, asthma and other chronic illnesses.

Preventing unnecessary use of toxic chemicals is smart public health policy, but it can also improve our international competitiveness. The European Union, home to the world’s largest chemical industry and 500 million consumers, is already tightening its regulations on chemicals.

Similarly, American consumers are demanding products that incorporate safer alternatives to toxic chemicals. By strengthening the Toxic Substances Control Act, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg’s bill can ensure that American products meet the highest standards worldwide, and spur innovation in healthier jobs and products here at home.
1708 2010-02-27 The result was a two-way tie for the lead at 11-under-par 131 halfway through the Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Wilson birdied the last four holes Friday for a five-under 66, and Villegas bogeyed No. 18 when he missed a 14-foot putt for par. Villegas settled for a 69 after tying the tournament first-round record with a nine-under 62 on Thursday.

Eleven players were within two shots of the lead at T.P.C. Scottsdale, where a crowd estimated at 101,709 attended the second round under thinly overcast conditions.

Anthony Kim (65), Ryan Moore (66) and Rickie Fowler (67) were 10 under.

Tom Lehman, nine days shy of his 51st birthday, had a 67 to top a group of six at nine under. Play was suspended because of darkness with one player, Matt Every, still on the course. He had a 3-footer for a birdie that would put him at nine under.

Wilson, who said he was ill early in the week after returning from the Mayakoba Golf Classic in Cancun, Mexico, considers himself the bland one among those at the top of the leader board.
1709 2010-02-27 Cuba’s critics place responsibility for Mr. Zapata’s death on the Castro government, with his mother, Reina Luisa Tamayo, accusing government officials of murder. Mr. Zapata, 42, had been denied water during his hunger strike for an extended period while being held at a maximum security prison in the eastern province of Camagüey, causing kidney failure, Cuban human rights officials have said. He later developed pneumonia at a Camagüey hospital before being sent to a prison hospital in Havana, where he died, activists say.

“The only way he would die is if the order was to let him die,” said one former political prisoner, Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo, adding that the authorities had forced nutrients on him during his own hunger strike and that they could have done the same for Mr. Zapata. “In my 22 years, I had to do more than a dozen hunger strikes. The only form of protest you had was a hunger strike.”

President Raúl Castro said Wednesday that he regretted the death but that it was the United States government, not Cuba, that bore responsibility. Mr. Zapata was arrested in 2003 with 75 others whom Cuba considered mercenaries working for Washington. Mr. Zapata was initially charged with “disrespect,” “public disorder” and “resistance,” but he later received decades of additional jail time for what the authorities described as disruptive behavior behind bars.

“We took him to Cuba’s best hospitals, and he died; we very much regret it,” Mr. Castro said during a joint appearance with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Castro added that the only torture being carried out in Cuba was that performed by the American military at the base in Guantánamo Bay, where detainees have conducted hunger strikes as well. “The day the United States decides to live in peace with us, all these problems will end,” Mr. Castro said.

Granma, the state newspaper, did not mention Mr. Zapata’s death, but it featured an article on Friday that deplored prison conditions in the United States.

Mr. Zapata’s declining health was widely known as his hunger strike extended into its 11th week, and American officials said they raised the issue with their Cuban counterparts at previously scheduled talks over immigration held in Havana on Feb. 19, just four days before he died.

Hunger strikes, which are not uncommon in Cuban prisons, typically prompt reprisals by the authorities, said Human Rights Watch, citing the case of Yordis García Fournier, who stopped eating for more than a month in 2008 and was placed in solitary confinement and prevented from receiving family visits.

“Left with no other remedy for abuses, political prisoners routinely undertake hunger strikes and other drastic measures to call attention to their treatment,” the organization said in a report released late last year that criticized Raúl Castro as being as aggressive toward political prisoners as his predecessor and brother, Fidel Castro.

Other recent hunger strikers include Alexander Santos Hernánez, a longtime activist, who went on a 23-day hunger strike in 2006 to put pressure on prison officials to grant him medical attention; and two detained journalists, Victor Rolando Arroyo Carmona and Juan Adolfo Fernández Sainez, who have stopped eating to protest prison conditions.

In 2009, after a long imprisonment, Jorge Luis García Pérez, who is known as Antúnez, began a hunger strike in his home to call for an end to abuses against political prisoners. While serving his 17-year sentence, he had founded a political prisoner group named after Pedro Luis Boitel, who undertook his fatal hunger strike while behind bars for criticizing the Castro government.

The most frequent Cuban hunger striker may be Guillermo Fariñas, who stopped eating for several months in 2006 to press for unrestricted access to the Internet. At the time, it was reported that he had carried out 20 hunger strikes since 1995.

Mr. da Silva was criticized back home in Brazil for not speaking out against Cuba’s treatment of Mr. Zapata during his talks with the island’s leadership, including a face-to-face meeting with Fidel Castro. Mr. da Silva expressed sorrow for Mr. Zapata’s death but also criticized his use of a hunger strike, noting that he once started one, but suspended it, while he was imprisoned as trade-union leader decades ago. “I am against hunger strikes,” he said.
1710 2010-02-27 ZURICH — A Swiss court ordered tax officials to drop two more cases involving account holders of the banking giant UBS, adding urgency to the government’s effort to find a political solution that would preserve a data-sharing agreement with American regulators.

The Federal Administrative Court, in a decision published on Friday, told Switzerland’s tax authority to comply with an earlier ruling that blocked it from sending American regulators information on 26 UBS customers. The court, located in Bern, said Switzerland could lift bank secrecy rules only when there was evidence of tax fraud.

The decision increases pressure to find a way to salvage the agreement to hand over data on as many as 4,450 UBS account holders as part of an American crackdown on tax evasion. Parliament, however, may be asked to approve the settlement to get around the court rulings.

With parliamentary approval, the court will not be able to “regard the UBS agreement as merely a mutual agreement” as it will have the same legal weight as a treaty, the government said.

The two UBS clients involved in the latest decision are among 26 covered by last month’s ruling. The court said that the account holders’ conduct — failing to complete tax forms or declare income — was tax evasion rather than tax fraud. Under Swiss law, tax fraud is a criminal offense, while evasion is a civil matter.

Officials with UBS, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and the Internal Revenue Service all declined to comment.
1711 2010-02-27 Now skaters accrue points according to the difficulty of technical moves; judges are a click away from slow-motion replay allowing them to review, say, the amount of time a skater holds a spiral or the landing position on a jump. If standards are not met, penalties ensue. Each step is an opportunity to accumulate more points.

In this environment there’s no such thing as spontaneity, which is the spice of art; rather, skating is more a competition than ever.

Another sad result of the new system is that techniques that score well don’t necessarily encourage innovative choreography, unless a skater is as skilled as Ms. Kim. As skaters go through the motions of their programs, it’s easy to imagine their frantic thoughts: “Double axel, double toe, double loop — check, check, check. Now smile.”

Instead of emphasizing technical ability, which strips the form of its soul, skating should take a page from the American skater Johnny Weir. True, he ended up in sixth place — hurt by a spin mishap in his long program — but otherwise skated beautifully. Skaters need more of the bravery he shows.

Mr. Weir is unusual, and not because of his flamboyance — he famously garnishes his costumes with feathers and tassels, and his skate guards are encrusted with rhinestones — but because he approaches skating from a choreographic sensibility. As so many skaters bend to the system, Mr. Weir refuses to become a slave to its rules, even if that means coming in sixth.

The sport lost an edge when compulsory or school figures, including basic figure eights, were eliminated from competition in 1990. (They have been replaced by a different set of tests called Moves in the Field, which are similar in some respects, but not part of competition.) Compulsory figures may have been monotonous for most to watch — part of their demise had to do with their inability to draw television viewers — but having to trace patterns onto the ice, embellishing them with brackets and loops, fostered control, precision and agility.

There is always a kind of freedom found in discipline, and, like a daily ballet barre for a dancer, the school figures embodied the essence of what a blade could achieve on the ice. Now there is so much jumping that it’s beginning to seem as if skaters spent more time in the air than on the ice, while the skating itself is relegated to breath-catching transition moves.

Ice dancing is different: with three stages of competition — compulsory, original and free dance — it comes the closest to what figure skating used to be, before the stunts found a way to overshadow nuance. In dancing you see edges and footwork; your eyes are drawn to the feet and to the way the arms extend from the back because, finally, skating is being presented as a whole-body experience.

Of course, in skating, nothing is safe from aesthetic assault. In the original dance category — the hapless theme for all was “country/folk dance”— the Russian couple Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin presented their infamous Aboriginal number, offensive on so many levels that I believe they must not have truly realized what the problem was.

Didn’t they want to win? Wearing tan body stockings with bits of green foliage stuck in strategic spots, Ms. Domnina and Mr. Shabalin skulked around the ice like cavemen. (It looked like a skit for a 4-H group.)

Later Alexandra and Roman Zaretsky, the Israeli brother-and-sister team, donned costumes too close to Orthodox Jewish garb to be effective theatrically for a clumsy program set to the Hebrew folk song “Hava Nagila.”

Why, in skating, is sophistication such a turnoff? Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, the Canadian pair who deservedly ended up with the gold medal, were the exception, not the rule, showing the world that gliding on ice could add up to more than athleticism. As Ms. Virtue and Mr. Moir skated, they seemed two bodies expelling one long, sensuous breath.

Figure skating may not be an art, but in such moments, it’s also not about winning: it’s about flying, and for three memorable nights in Vancouver, that’s just what Ms. Virtue and Mr. Moir did.
1712 2010-02-27 Also deleted were a month’s worth of e-mail files from the summer of 2002 for Patrick Philbin, another Justice Department lawyer who worked on the interrogation opinions. Those missing e-mail messages came during a period when two of the critical interrogation memos were being prepared.

Mr. Yoo’s lawyer, Miguel Estrada, said Mr. Yoo had left the Justice Department by the time the Office of Professional Responsibility had begun its review and “has no basis for knowing whether e-mails are gone or why.” In pursuing the matter, Mr. Leahy is “simply chasing his tail and feeding far-left conspiracy theories,” Mr. Estrada said.

Mr. Philbin did not respond to requests for comment Friday.

Mr. Leahy said the disappearance of the e-mail messages raised “serious concerns about government transparency and whether the Office of Professional Responsibility had access to all the information relevant to the inquiries.”

The original interrogation memos “were intended to provide a golden shield to commit torture and get away with it,” Mr. Leahy argued, but he said questions about how the memos were developed and what role the White House played may go unanswered.

Mr. Leahy also noted that 22 million missing e-mail messages from the Bush White House were recovered just two months ago, including batches of communications that had been sought by the judiciary committee as part of its oversight work into the 2007 firings of United States attorneys and other matters.

Gary Grindler, the acting deputy attorney general who represented the Justice Department at Friday’s hearing, said he did not think there was “anything nefarious” about the deletion of the e-mail messages, but he could not explain what happened to them.

He said he had directed administrative personnel at the Justice Department to review the situation and determine whether there were problems in the department’s system for automatically archiving internal documents. He said the review would also seek to recover the missing e-mail messages if possible.

In its final report, the Office for Professional Responsibility concluded that Mr. Yoo and his former boss, Jay S. Bybee, demonstrated professional misconduct in preparing the legal opinions that justified waterboarding and other interrogation tactics on Al Qaeda suspects in American custody.

The office’s findings were overruled, however, in another report released the same day by David Margolis, the associate deputy attorney general, who said Mr. Yoo and Mr. Bybee demonstrated flawed reasoning but not misconduct. Mr. Margolis rejected the Office of Professional Responsibility’s attempt to refer Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at Berkeley, and Mr. Bybee, a federal appellate judge, to state bar officials for possible disciplinary action.

Republicans on the Judiciary Committee appeared unconcerned about the missing e-mail messages and said that if the Justice Department were to continue investigating anything involving the interrogation memos, it should be whether officials at the Office of Professional Responsibility or elsewhere at the Justice Department improperly leaked details of the ethics inquiry to the news media over the last year.

Senator Jon Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said Mr. Yoo and Mr. Bybee deserved “the thanks of a grateful nation for their service,” not accusations, and that the leaks had done “irreparable damage” to their reputations.
1713 2010-02-27 Lindsey Vonn’s Olympics, which started so triumphantly with a gold medal in the women’s downhill, sputtered to a close on Friday as she missed a gate on the slalom course at Whistler Mountain and failed to finish for the third time in five races.

While Vonn was sidelined in the first run, her good friend Maria Riesch of Germany won her second gold medal of the Vancouver Games, skiing two smooth runs despite a soft course continually dusted with new snow. The conditions were a far cry from the usual icy track that top-level ski races are competed on, but Riesch made all the necessary adjustments.

“I was happy with my first gold medal and the second one is just incredible,” Riesch said. “The course was tricky and the snow made it hard to see at times but we ski slalom in that kind of stuff all the time. It didn’t really affect me. When you get that close to a gold medal, maybe nothing affects you.”

Marlies Schild of Austria won the silver and Sarka Zahrobska of the Czech Republic won bronze.

Vonn was racing despite crashing in the giant slalom on Wednesday and breaking a finger. Slalom is far from her strongest event — she is most dominant in the speed events, not the technical ones — and she has trained at it very little this season and especially since she sustained her shin injury in early February. But she has won two World Cup races in the discipline and hoped to shake off her various maladies and contend for an unlikely medal.

Instead, her skis got separated — her right one flying wide — on a gate about 16 seconds into her first run, and she could not pull them together in time for the next gate, which she straddled. She skied off, head down in disappointment.
1714 2010-02-27 BANGKOK — The Supreme Court in Myanmar refused an appeal on Friday to abbreviate the current term of house arrest of the country’s long-detained leading dissident, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.

A lawyer representing her, Nyan Win, said he was preparing a final, “special” appeal, but the prospects of success seemed dim.

The current term — an extension of 18 months — was handed down after the authorities contended that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar’s beleaguered democracy movement, violated the terms of her previous house arrest by allowing an uninvited American visitor to enter her waterfront home after he swam across a lake to it last year.

The extended term ends in November, but her release even then is uncertain in a country where the military wields near-absolute power, and where Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained under various pretexts for most of the past 20 years.

“She is now under detention by order of Gen. Than Shwe,” said Mr. Nyan Win, who is also spokesman for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, the National League for Democracy. “He can release her anytime.”
1715 2010-02-27 It ruled unanimously that Mr. Thaksin and his former wife, Pojaman, falsely claimed to have transferred their shares of his telecommunications company, Shin Corporation, to family members because he was not allowed to hold them while prime minister.

The court said that Mr. Thaksin, a telecommunications billionaire who was ousted in a coup in 2006, had abused power by tailoring government policies to benefit Shin Corporation and related businesses.

“The accused unscrupulously received money from selling shares through the use of his political powers,” a judge said.

The paradox of Mr. Thaksin’s political movement — that a billionaire telecommunications tycoon has inspired a large number of poor, disaffected voters with populist policies like inexpensive health care and financial assistance — was on display Friday at the headquarters of the main opposition party, where his followers gathered to hear the verdict.

“It’s not fair; there’s no justice any longer in Thailand,” said Sunaree Siraseehakul, 72, a clothing trader in Bangkok.

Calm at first, the crowd at the opposition headquarters angrily shouted obscenities as the judges read the verdict. They broke into a chant: “Thaksin, fight! Fight!”

By late in the evening, there were no reports of the violent reaction that the government had warned about. Thousands of police officers and soldiers had been placed on alert around Bangkok to guard against protests by Mr. Thaksin’s supporters.

Riot police officers with shields and helmets guarded the courthouse as the nine justices spent more than seven hours reading out the arguments and their ruling.

Mr. Thaksin’s supporters, known as the red shirts for the outfits they wear at rallies, have been violent in the past. But they denied that they had planned demonstrations on Friday. Instead, they said, they are organizing a mass rally in Bangkok for mid-March.

“We will not do anything today,” said Sit Kitanon, 58, a businessman in a red shirt, as he stood in front of the courthouse. “Today is not our day. But our day will come.”

He added: “If the court destroys Thaksin, the court is destroying democracy. I am not here for Thaksin, but I care about justice.”

Mr. Thaksin sold Shin Corporation to a Singaporean holding company in January 2006, a transaction that evaded taxes, aroused anger and prompted street demonstrations that set the stage for the coup nine months later.

When the generals who staged the coup gave up power in a new election a little more than a year later, a party backing Mr. Thaksin was overwhelmingly elected.

Protests resumed, and in August 2008, thousands of anti-Thaksin demonstrators, known as yellow shirts, barricaded the prime minister’s compound, setting up a tent city and demanding that the government be dissolved.

In late November 2008, they took over Bangkok’s two airports for a week, stranding thousands of passengers.

They ended their protests in December, when a court found the pro-Thaksin governing party guilty of electoral fraud, forcing its dissolution.

The current government, led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, took office in a parliamentary vote. Since then, it has been the pro-Thaksin protesters who have been demanding the dissolution of what they call an unelected government.

In April 2009, they forced the closing of a regional summit meeting in Pattaya, a resort town southeast of Bangkok, and shortly afterward paralyzed the capital with riots that left two people dead.

Many in Bangkok took the government’s warnings to heart and stayed off the streets on Friday, some of them following the court proceedings on radio and on voice feeds to television. Some people said that in the charged atmosphere, they were avoiding wearing the colors red or yellow for fear of starting an argument.

“It is a sensitive day,” said Weena Sirithinpayak, a saleswoman in a shopping mall in central Bangkok.

But it seems to be a given here now that Thailand’s acrimonious divide will not be resolved easily, or perhaps even peacefully.

“It’s becoming more of a class thing, and I’m worried about that,” said Rainy Phrompechrut, a writer for a golf magazine.

In a running blog on the court session, Thanong Khanthong, a columnist for the English-language newspaper The Nation, wrote, “The potential clash looks inevitable, as any political compromise is out of the question.”

Mr. Thaksin has been living out of the country since August 2007, after jumping bail and fleeing a two-year sentence for violating conflict of interest rules in connection with the purchase of land in Bangkok while he was prime minister.

But Mr. Thaksin has remained a political force in Thailand as he has traveled the world from his base in Dubai and apparently retains enough wealth to finance a nationwide political machine.

1720 2010-02-28 “USING these instruments in a way that intentionally destabilizes a company or a country is  is counterproductive, and I’m sure the S.E.C. will be looking into that.”

That’s what Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week when lawmakers asked him about credit default swaps during his Congressional testimony. Concerns are growing about such swaps  securities that offer insurance-like protection and helped tip over the American International Group in 2008 when it couldn’t pay mounting claims on the contracts.

Now, there are fears that the use of these swaps may also help propel entire countries  think Greece  to the precipice.

First, Greece employed swaps to mask its true debt picture, with the help of Wall Street bankers, of course. And now it appears that some traders are using swaps to bet that Greece won’t be able to meet its debt payments and will face a possible default.

Mr. Bernanke is undoubtedly an intelligent man. But his view that it’s “counterproductive” to use credit default swaps to crash an institution or a nation exhibits a certain naïveté about how the titans of finance operate now.

High-octane trading may be counterproductive to taxpayers, for sure. But not to the speculators who win big when such transactions pay off. And in the case of A.I.G., the speculators got their winnings from the taxpayers.

The certainty that Mr. Bernanke expressed about the S.E.C.’s inquiry into credit default swaps is quaint as well. If the past is prologue, we might see a case or two emerge from that inquiry five years from now. The fact is that credit default swaps and other complex derivatives that have proved to be instruments of mass destruction still remain entrenched in our financial system three years after our economy was almost brought to its knees.

DERIVATIVES are responsible for much of the interconnectedness between banks and other institutions that made the financial collapse accelerate in the way that it did, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions in bailouts. Yet credit default swaps have been largely untouched by financial reform efforts.

This is not surprising. Given how much money is generated by the big institutions trading these instruments, these entities are showering money on Washington to protect their profits. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reported that revenue generated by United States banks in their credit derivatives trading totaled $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009.

Congressional “reform” plans for credit default swaps are full of loopholes, guaranteeing that another derivatives-fueled financial crisis awaits us. According to the Bank for International Settlements, credit default swaps with a face value of $36 trillion were outstanding in the second quarter of 2009, the most recent figures available.

Credit default swaps are “a way to increase the leverage in the system, and the people who were doing it knew that they were doing something on the edge of fraudulent,” said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and author of 37 books, many of them on banking. “They were not well-motivated.”

Mr. Mayer has been critical of credit default swaps almost since they arrived on the scene. In 1999, for example, he wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal entitled “The Dangers of Derivatives.”

“These ‘over the counter’ derivatives  created, sold and serviced behind closed doors by consenting adults who don’t tell anybody what they’re doing  are also a major source of the almost unlimited leverage that brought the world financial system to the brink of disaster last fall,” he wrote, referring to the market turmoil of 1998. “The derivatives dealers’ demands for liquidity far exceed what the markets can provide on difficult days, and may exceed the abilities of the central banks to maintain orderly conditions.”

Calling credit derivatives “the most dangerous instrument yet,” Mr. Mayer concluded in his article that neither banks nor bank examiners have any idea how to handle them. “The system is easily gamed, and it sacrifices the great strength of banks as financial intermediaries  their knowledge of their borrowers, and their incentive to police the status of the loan,” he wrote.

Pointing to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he said: “In the presence of moral hazard  the likelihood that sloughing the bad loans into a swap will be profitable  the growth of a market for default risks could lead to bank insolvencies.”

His predictions having come true, I asked Mr. Mayer for solutions to the problems that credit default swaps have created. He had several.

First, he said, those trading in swaps must be forced to put up more capital to back them so that if a client asks for payment, the issuer actually has the funds on hand to do so.
1721 2010-02-28 BANGKOK (AP) — The former determination after a court ordered the seizure of $1.4 billion of his assets.

But analysts and editorials speculated that the Supreme Court’s decision not to seize all $2.3 billion of Mr. Thaksin’s frozen assets would at least temporarily ease political conflicts that have plagued the country for the past four years.

The court ruled Friday that Mr. Thaksin, who made a fortune in telecommunications, abused his power to enrich himself and his family while in office.

In a statement issued Saturday, Mr. Thaksin, who is in self-imposed exile in Dubai, said the ruling would not stop him from trying to lead a nonviolent struggle against the government.

In possible fallout from the court’s decision, a small explosive shattered the glass doors of a branch of Bangkok Bank in the Thai capital on Saturday night, but it caused no casualties.
1722 2010-02-28 Mr. Price is not the only one defying conventional journalism wisdom. Palo Alto, a highly wired Silicon Valley community, is, too.

At a time when many cities struggle to support one newspaper, Palo Alto has three: The Daily Post, The Daily News, which began publishing in 1995, and The Palo Alto Weekly, which has a daily online edition and has been around since 1979.

This month, in the days after the crash of a small plane caused a 10-hour blackout in Palo Alto and killed three employees of Tesla Motors, the three papers, combined, published some 30 articles examining everything from the city’s response to the power grid’s connection with the city-run electric utility.

And in a city where laptops, iPhones and Kindles are standard issue, many residents still walk a block or two to pick up one of the city’s newspapers, all of which are free.

“It is phenomenal to go into a coffee shop in the morning and see people reading local newspapers,” said Ted Glasser, a professor of communications at Stanford. “These are manageable newspapers. You can read them in 15 or 20 minutes.”

Whether the competition amounts to an old-fashioned newspaper war or a skirmish between struggling outfits with bare-bones staffs is a matter of debate.

“This newspaper war is probably being conducted with very low-caliber ammunition,” said Alan Mutter, a newspaper consultant who writes a blog about the industry called Reflections of a Newsosaur.

The three newspapers are small. The Daily Post, the smallest, has a newsroom staff of five, and works out of a cramped warehouse space near downtown that Mr. Price likes to call the most efficient use of 800 square feet in the city.

The Daily News, like many other papers, has been forced to cut its staff, and some residents say it is struggling to fill a hole left by the 2007 closing of the Palo Alto bureau of The San Jose Mercury News, which is also owned by MediaNews Group. The two papers now share articles. (MediaNews Group is currently in bankruptcy, but the publisher of The Daily News said the paper’s operations would not be affected.)

The Palo Alto Weekly also cut a few positions, mostly through attrition, and reduced its print publication to one day a week in 2008, from two.

Still, all three newspapers say that they are profitable and that they are here to stay.

There are many reasons Palo Alto enjoys such a relative wealth of news coverage. It is affluent and has a highly educated, civically engaged population. Its pricey real-estate market and other high-end businesses provide a relatively strong advertising base, even during a recession.

But the competition is also the result of the characters involved, and in particular the outsized personality of Mr. Price.

“The market hasn’t demanded three newspapers,” said Bill Johnson, the publisher of The Palo Alto Weekly, whose Web site, which attracts 130,000 visitors each month, is a virtual gathering spot for the community. “It is circumstantial.”

The circumstances Mr. Johnson refers to are spelled out on The Daily Post’s Web site, which summarizes the story of Mr. Price and Jim Pavelich, the co-owner.

The two men helped to start and run The Daily News in 1995. The paper quickly became known for a confrontational style critical of City Hall and government in general. It routinely printed the salaries of all government employees. The paper quickly increased its advertising base by offering discounts to advertisers. In 2005, Knight Ridder, the owner of The Mercury News, bought The Daily News. Mr. Price said the sale price was $25 million.

The purchase “was really not for the journalism,” said Anthony P. Ridder, who was then chief executive of Knight Ridder. “It was to provide additional ways for our advertisers to reach their customers.”

The following year Knight Ridder was sold and split, and The Daily News ended up in the hands of MediaNews Group, which also owns most other Bay Area newspapers except for The San Francisco Chronicle. The tone of The Daily News became more traditional.

“Most people in the community think it is vastly improved,” said Mr. Johnson, of The Palo Alto Weekly, which often publishes longer, in-depth articles, like a four-month investigation into high school sports.

But the changes at The Daily News were not to Mr. Price’s liking. He called its reporting “namby-pamby.”

Mario Dianda, the editor of The Daily News, said, “Our stories are fair and timely.” He said a lengthy article last week on the impact of a 22-year-old school desegregation program illustrated the paper’s mission “to provide quality community journalism.”

When Mr. Price and Mr. Pavelich sold The Daily News, they signed an agreement not to compete with it for three years. They started The Daily Post weeks after the agreement expired, and quickly resumed their old approach with its motif of salary lists. The approach may have had impact: Last year, Mr. Price wrote two dozen consecutive editorials sharply criticizing a proposed business tax. The proposal failed at the polls.

“The Daily Post has a pretty consistent negativism about anything that is going on in the city,” said Larry Klein, a member of the Palo Alto City Council.

Peter Carpenter, who has held various government positions, said he recently helped organize a meeting between residents and police officials in Atherton. Mr. Carpenter said The Daily News coverage was balanced, but The Daily Post’s headline read “Atherton Slams Cops,” which, he said, “says it all.”

Mr. Price said critics objected because The Daily Post was tougher than its rivals.

It is unclear whether multiple newspapers create a more informed citizenry.

“I think we have both more informed, and on occasion more inflamed, citizens,” said Mayor Pat Burt of Palo Alto.

But, he said, “it is a challenge if good segments of the community are getting much of their information from a source that is predominantly critical.”

Mr. Burt and others say, however, that it is good for the city to have a diversity of news outlets.

“I am really happy that we have all these papers,” said Esther Wojcicki, who heads the Palo Alto High School journalism program, the largest such program in the country. “I wish that kind of choice were available to more people in more areas.”
1723 2010-02-28 Though critics of the Chicago Transit Authority’s recent cuts in service contend that the reductions disproportionately affect low-income and minority areas, a Chicago News Cooperative analysis of transit, racial and economic data paints a more even-handed, and milder, picture.

A measurement of wait times and reductions of late-night service shows that the cuts do not have a bigger affect on those sections of the city.

Critics argue that minorities, particularly on the South and West Sides, are hurt worse by the service cuts because they rely more on buses than trains to get to work, and because the C.T.A. trimmed more buses than trains.

“Those neighborhoods, with the most users who have the farthest to go for their jobs, are the most impacted by this,” the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in a phone interview last week. “That you can document.”

But an analysis of the C.T.A.’s service cuts against ethnic and economic data found no relationship between the reductions and race or poverty — whether wait times or late-night decreases. Nor did the data show a relationship between the cuts and income.
1724 2010-02-28 ROME (Reuters) — An Italian court on Saturday rejected a request to suspend a corruption trial against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Mr. Berlusconi is charged with bribing his former lawyer, David Mills, to withhold incriminating details of his business dealings. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.

Italy’s top court last week threw out a related case against Mr. Mills because it said the statute of limitations had expired. While the court did not issue a detailed explanation of its reasoning, the ruling raised the possibility that Mr. Berlusconi could argue his trial should be dropped on the same grounds.

On Saturday, Mr. Berlusconi’s lawyers argued for a suspension of his trial until the Supreme Court issued its explanation in the Mills case.

A judge in Milan refused the request, but he adjourned the proceedings that started Saturday until March 26.

The prime minister, who also faces another trial on charges of tax fraud, said this week that he was being hounded by magistrates, who are a like “band of Talibans.” He had repeatedly said that liberal judges were against his center-right government.
1725 2010-02-28 AUSTIN, Tex. (AP) —The Texas Longhorns began spring practice Friday, with Garrett Gilbert stepping in to replace Colt McCoy at quarterback. Coach Mack Brown is already saying he expects Gilbert to be “really good.”

It is easy to see why.

Less than two months ago, Gilbert, a former national high school player of the year, was pressed into duty five plays into the Bowl Championship Series title game against Alabama when McCoy was injured.

Gilbert, a freshman with little experience, struggled early as Texas fell behind, 24-6.

But he rallied the Longhorns with two touchdown passes in the second half before two late scores sealed the Crimson Tide’s 37-21 win.

Brown said playing on a big stage prepared Gilbert to take over the Texas offense.

“If he had not played in that game and had not played well like he did,” Brown said, pausing before adding: “I think the team probably wouldn’t know what they had going into the spring. Now they know. This guy can be good.

“We hope he gets back on that stage. He’ll never be on a bigger one.”

Brown said Gilbert was hurt by the loss to Alabama despite being thrust into a difficult situation, one in which few would have expected him to succeed.

Gilbert was 15 of 40 passing with 4 interceptions, but those numbers do not show how much better he played in the second half.
1726 2010-02-28 That means that those nonprofit groups, which are not required to disclose their donors, can now use corporate contributions to buy political commercials, and the corporations can potentially operate behind the anonymity of their donations.“Clearly, that’s where the action’s going to be,” said Kenneth A. Gross, a Washington lawyer who advises corporations on political law.

While last month’s decision allows corporations to spend without limit on advertising for or against candidates, if they do so directly, they will have to report their expenditures and identify their donors. Mr. Gross said corporations are often loath to have their names attached to such advertisements. The nonprofit groups, with their legal ability to withhold donors’ names, offer an attractive alternative, he said.

Democratic Congressional leaders called the loophole dangerous, and they have proposed legislation that would require nonprofit groups to identify publicly the sources of financing for their political advertisements.

Mr. Gross, a former associate general counsel for the Federal Election Commission, said he generally supported disclosure requirements, though he said some of them might be hard to enforce. He also questioned whether some of the legislation’s other provisions would hold up in court.

The McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, passed in 2002, sought to limit the use of attack advertising late in election campaigns. It imposed restrictions on the types of broadcast, cable and satellite advertisements that could appear within 30 days of a federal primary or within 60 days of a federal general election.

“Electioneering communications,” as the McCain-Feingold act calls the advertising, are required to focus on issues rather than candidates. They can name candidates in regard to a political issue, like a particular bill, but they cannot call for a candidate’s election or defeat.

McCain-Feingold barred corporations and unions from financing electioneering communications. In 2006, however, the Supreme Court, in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, held that it is unconstitutional to bar corporations from spending their money on electioneering communications.

Election commission rules require that organizations and individuals placing advocacy advertising or electioneering communications report their expenditures and identify donors who gave them money for those purposes. Many nonprofit groups, however, have taken the position that their donors and dues-paying members did not give them money specifically for political uses. Therefore, the groups have maintained, they are not obligated to name contributors.

It is impossible to know whether corporations or unions are taking advantage of the new freedom to funnel pro- or anti-candidate money through nonprofit organizations. Election commission data on electioneering spending may offer a glimpse of the future, though.

After the 2006 Wisconsin Right to Life decision, there was no sudden surge in direct corporate spending on issue advertising. Electioneering communications spending by nonprofit groups that did not identify their donors, however, increased sharply. Of the $98.7 million in electioneering communications reported in the 2004 cycle, virtually all was accompanied by identification of at least some donors. In the 2008 cycle, over one-third of the $116.5 million reported was not accompanied by donor identification.

The United States Chamber of Commerce was the biggest spender on electioneering communications not to identify any donors.

Among provisions in a bill proposed this month by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, both Democrats, is a requirement that nonprofit groups engaging in political advertising set up accounts specifically for that purpose. The bill would require that the nonprofit organizations identify people and groups who contribute directly to those accounts, or whose dues or other donations are transferred from other accounts into the political accounts.

The bill would also require organizations that raise outside money for political advertisements to list their top five contributors at the end of a commercial. In addition, an advertisement would have to display a statement from its No. 1 donor accepting responsibility for its content.

Mr. Gross questioned whether the legislation would face constitutional questions.

The bill would prohibit companies that received federal bailout money — as well as companies that hold federal contracts and companies that are more than 20 percent owned by foreign entities — from making political expenditures. It would also bar a company from doing so if a majority of its board consists of foreign principals, or if its operations in the United States or its political decision-making is controlled by a foreign entity.

Mr. Schumer expressed confidence that the bill could withstand court scrutiny.

“We think everything in this bill will stand constitutional muster, and we drafted it with that in mind,” he said.
1727 2010-02-28 Stephanie Renée Bressler and Blake Weissberg were married Saturday evening at the Rockleigh Country Club in Rockleigh, N.J. Rabbi Dennis Tobin officiated.

Mrs. Weissberg, 28, is a strategic planning analyst for CNN.com in New York, where she analyzes the advertisements that run on the Web site. She graduated from Syracuse University.

She is the daughter of Esther Bressler and Neil J. Bressler of Old Bridge, N.J. Her father is the managing partner of Skwiersky, Alpert & Bressler, an accounting firm in New York.

The bridegroom, 27, is a real estate sales associate for Corcoran Sunshine in New York. He graduated from the University of Arizona.

He is the son of Laura Weissberg and Jan N. Weissberg of Long Beach, N.Y. His mother is a sales consultant in the handbag department at Bergdorf Goodman in New York. His father is an owner of Angelo & Maxie’s Steakhouse and Maxie’s Bar and Grill in New York.
1728 2010-02-28 DAMARA LYNN GREENE was pinup-girl gorgeous in a tight black bodysuit and feather-fringed boots as she shimmied across the stage at Sugar Bar. She pouted. She twirled. She kicked her leg so high she nearly nicked a man in the front row with her heel. When she launched into a kinetic rendition of the Janet Jackson anthem “What Have You Done For Me Lately?” the crowd roared, one voice booming above the rest.

“I love her,” yelled André Leon Talley, Vogue’s editor at large and a regular at Sugar Bar, the Upper West Side club owned by the singing duo Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. Mr. Talley waved his arms, the ground vibrating as his feet pounded the floor. “Tell it,” he shouted. “Get it out, girl.”

It was the last night of Fashion Week, and the industry had been sucking in its collective stomach for too long. Mr. Talley, like many of his peers, was cutting loose after days of catwalk air kisses and behind-the-curtain theatrics. Sugar Bar is an R&B refuge on an otherwise bland stretch of West 72nd Street, and he can be found there most Thursdays for open-mike night.

This time he brought his good friend Whoopi Goldberg, the other half of what has become fashion’s newest odd couple. The two friends had been seated side by side at the Calvin Klein show, had wandered together backstage at events for Laura Smalls and Chado Ralph Rucci, and had shared a dinner of pan-baked bread, shrimp and cod at Monkey Bar that night, before heading uptown.

Curious patrons snaked through the aisle to catch a glimpse of the two while CeCe Peniston, best known for the 1990s dance hit “Finally,” sang onstage in a hip-hugging short dress. Three young women from West Virginia who were in town for Fashion Week debated whether to ask Mr. Talley for his autograph. Another fan asked Ms. Goldberg to be photographed holding a sign that read “Happy Birthday Gloria.”

But as captivated as the clubgoers were by the duo, so too were Mr. Talley and Ms. Goldberg of them. “You are great,” Ms. Goldberg shouted at an aspiring singer named Andre Henry after he performed a soulful version of Marvin Gaye’s “I Want You.”
1729 2010-02-28 Re “Play It Again, Broadway, and Again” by Stuart Miller [Feb. 21]:

While it is great to see some of the current revivals on Broadway like “A View From the Bridge” and “A Little Night Music,” it is disappointing that there are so few new works being produced. Unless you’re a well-known name, like David Mamet, your chances are smaller than small. Why can’t theaters do readings or productions and introduce their audiences to new and exciting authors? I hope that this changes, and that we get a new, young, enthusiastic audience for theaters.John Weldon
1730 2010-02-28 Yet despite its underdog status, the Forte cedes nothing to its brand-name rivals in styling, price, performance, fuel economy or features. For the value buyer — including parents whose patronage allows their offspring to drive a new car — Kia’s warranty is another comforting point.

The Forte comes with bumper-to-bumper protection for five years or 60,000 miles, powertrain coverage for 10 years or 100,000 miles and roadside assistance for five years or 60,000 miles. In comparison, the Honda Civic has bumper-to-bumper coverage of three years or 36,000 miles, a powertrain warranty of five years or 60,000 miles and no roadside assistance.

One goal of any economy car should be to look more expensive than it is. The Forte succeeds handsomely, with broad, tailored shoulders and the modern wedge shape of small cars in Europe. Credit for the confident shape goes to Kurt Kahl, a designer at Kia’s California studio.

As on the two-door version of the Forte, called the Koup, the exterior pays mild homage to the Civic. Yet inside, the Kia actually improves on the Honda’s too-precious futurism with a more straightforward ergonomic layout and more standard goodies. Materials, except for distressingly vinyl-esque leather that is, thankfully, an option, are average-to-better for the class. The back seat is spacious for two tall adults, with a center perch for a third that’s more useful than in some rivals. The trunk, with capacity of 14.7 cubic feet, is the roomiest in its competitive set.

Storage is generous, with bottle holders in the front doors, a deep center console and the kind of large, open central cubby that some larger cars overlook — the perfect resting place for keys, BlackBerries and what have you.

Standard hookups include a U.S.B. port for an iPod, an auxiliary jack and two 12-volt outlets. Even the least expensive sedan, the $14,390 LX, comes with a free three-month subscription to Sirius Satellite Radio.

Even the bargain-basement LX has six standard air bags, electronic traction and stability control; antilock brakes with brake assist and electronic force distribution; active front head restraints and seat belts in all five positions, with belt height adjusters up front. But air-conditioning is part of a $1,500 package that includes a split folding rear seat and a rear armrest with cup holders.

For any model, add $1,000 for an automatic transmission — either a 4-speed on the LX and EX or a 5-speed with manual-shift function on the SX. (The SX’s standard gearbox is a 6-speed manual rather than the 5-speed units on other versions.)

I first drove an EX automatic, which started at $17,690 and reached $19,490 with the $1,000 leather package (which included heated seats, steering wheel and shift knob) and an $800 sunroof.

A 2-liter 4-cylinder engine with variable valve timing gives the LX and EX models a solid 156 horsepower and 144 pound-feet of torque. The motor is workmanlike, though it doesn’t rev like Honda’s silken 4-cylinder engines. And it is good for 25 miles per gallon in the city and 34 on the highway with either transmission.

An optional $600 fuel economy package adds gas-saving tricks like electric power steering, an intermittent alternator, low-rolling-resistance tires and aerodynamic tweaks. It lifts the EX’s mileage to a class-leading 27/36 m.p.g.

But there’s an interesting player in the lineup: The SX, which brings a touch of sport to a largely plain-vanilla class, but costs thousands less than true performance-oriented compacts like the Mazda 3 s or Honda Civic Si.

The SX’s 2.4-liter engine spins out 173 horsepower and 168 pound-feet of torque, more juice than the Mazda’s optional 2.5-liter (167 horsepower), but less than Honda’s 2-liter (197).

That larger SX engine gets somewhat raspy in its highest registers, but the useful midrange torque and passing power more than make up for the added sound. The throttle feels sluggish off the line, but the engine will yank the Kia from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in 8.6 seconds, according to Edmunds.com, which is just 0.5 second behind the peppy Mazda. For its $18,190 base price, the SX also comes with a firmer suspension, larger front brakes and sportier 17-inch wheels and tires.

Edmunds also reported that the Forte SX ran through its slalom course at a surprisingly brisk 67.6 m.p.h., just 1 m.p.h. slower than the Mazda 3 s; the Kia also pulled an eye-opening 0.86 g’s of lateral cornering force on a skidpad.

But track numbers don’t necessarily translate into action on the street. In real-world driving, the SX is reasonably fun to toss around, but when speeds really climb the Forte’s chassis isn’t as impeccably composed as the Mazda’s.

But while the Kia can’t match the Mazda’s handling or the Civic Si’s high-revving refinement, those cars can run into the mid-$20,000s, a whole league above the Forte.

For budget shoppers, including generous parents, saving $500 here or $1,000 there can tip the scales in a car’s favor. If that budget demands a sedan in the sweet spot between $15,000 and $20,000, the Forte’s more-for-less strategy becomes especially compelling — unless you’re willing to pay more to polish a Honda or Toyota badge.

INSIDE TRACK: Running with the big dogs now.
1731 2010-02-28 According to the unwritten constitution that governs ordinary American life and makes possible a shared pop culture that even new immigrants can jump right into after a few movies and a trip to the mall, the senior year of public high school is less a climactic academic experience than an occasion for oafish goofing off, chronic truancy, random bullying, sloppy dancing in rented formalwear and interludes of moody, wan philosophizing (often at sunrise while still half-drunk and staring off at a misty river or the high-school parking lot) about the looming bummer of adulthood. In films like “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” “Dazed and Confused” and “High School Musical 3,” senior year is a do-little sabbatical from what is presented as the long dull labor of acquiring knowledge, honing skills and internalizing social norms. It’s a spree, senior year, that discharges built-up tensions. It’s an adolescent Mardi Gras. And it’s not an indulgence but an entitlement. Remember that line in your yearbook? Seniors rule! And they rule not because they’ve accomplished much, necessarily (aside from surviving to age 18 or so and not dropping out or running away from home), but because it’s tradition, and seniors crave tradition. They crave it because they know, deep down, they’re lost, and tradition helps them hide this fear. From juniors.

This year of licensed irresponsibility, this two-semester recurring national holiday, was threatened recently in Utah by a Republican legislator’s proposal to do away with 12th grade entirely. The idea was advanced as a budget-cutting measure — a way to shave millions from the cash-strapped state’s expense sheet — and it called forth the sort of instant, intense hostility that often signals that an inspired notion, truly innovative, truly new, has, by some miracle, entered politics. The proposal drew scorn from teachers and students alike (another tribute to its possible genius) and swiftly spread across the news wires, eliciting such hostility and controversy that its sponsor flinched. Aware, perhaps, that his offbeat plan was drawing unwelcome attention to a state that has spent the modern era in a permanent defensive crouch thanks to a Mormon religious culture that many view as joyless and eccentric, the lawmaker suggested that 12th grade — that ritual time out from the march of time itself — be made optional rather than nonexistent.

But did he compromise too readily? For many American high-school seniors, especially the soberest and most studious, senior year is a holding pattern, a redundancy, a way of running out the clock on a game that has already been won. When winter vacation rolls around, many of them, thanks to college early-admissions programs, know all they need to about their futures and have no more reason to hang around the schoolhouse than prehistoric fish had need for water once they grew limbs and could crawl out of the oceans. As for students who aren’t headed to four-year colleges but two-year community colleges or vocational schools, why not just get started early and read “Moby Dick” for pleasure, if they wish, rather than to earn a grade that they don’t need? Kids who plan to move right into the labor force are in the same position. They may as well spend the whole year in detention — which some of them, bored and restless, end up doing. Twelfth grade, for the sorts of students I’ve just described, amounts to a fidgety waiting period that practically begs for descents into debauchery and concludes in a big dumb party under a mirror ball that spins in place like the minds of those beneath it.

It’s not just one Utah lawmaker who has noticed this. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has, too, it seems. In the interest of speeding students on their way to productive, satisfying careers, the foundation intends to give a $1.5 million grant to a project organized by the nonprofit National Center on Education and the Economy. The goal is to help certain students leapfrog the keg party and go directly from 10th grade to community colleges after passing a battery of tests. The goal is not to save money but precious time, and the program is modeled on systems now in place in Denmark, Finland, France and Singapore — countries whose young folk, in many cases, speak English more grammatically than a lot of American high-school seniors do. One of the fledgling program’s backers, Terry Holliday, Kentucky’s commissioner of education, calls the program’s approach “move on when ready.” Compared with the prevailing current system, which might be termed “move on when all your friends do” or “move on when stir-crazy” or just “move on,” it seems both more pragmatic and humane, not to mention more likely to raise the G.D.P.

If senior year were to vanish from our high schools, either completely or in part, would its infamous excesses, feats of sloth, dances and stretches of absenteeism shift to junior year? To some degree. But what also might happen is that the education process, if it was shortened and compressed some, might help kids think more clearly about their paths in life and set out on them on the right foot instead of waiting to shape up later on. And what would they miss, really, under such a system? As someone who left high school a year early thanks to an offer from a progressive college that I didn’t seek but hungrily accepted (anything to escape those hours of “study hall” that we passed by folding sheets of paper until they couldn’t be folded any tighter, at which point we flicked them at one another’s heads), I guess I wouldn’t know. But I did learn from my visits home that my former classmates’ senior years did them few favors maturationwise, other than to make one an unwed mother and a couple of them into victims of major car collisions. That’s why, to my mind, Utah should feel free to ax senior year, bank the savings and see what happens. My hunch is that nothing will happen. Nothing much. Just the loss of a year when nothing much happens anyhow.
1732 2010-02-28 The persistence of this affliction — and the fact that it seemed to be heritable — posed a serious challenge to Darwin’s new evolutionary theory. If depression was a disorder, then evolution had made a tragic mistake, allowing an illness that impedes reproduction — it leads people to stop having sex and consider suicide — to spread throughout the population. For some unknown reason, the modern human mind is tilted toward sadness and, as we’ve now come to think, needs drugs to rescue itself.

The alternative, of course, is that depression has a secret purpose and our medical interventions are making a bad situation even worse. Like a fever that helps the immune system fight off infection — increased body temperature sends white blood cells into overdrive — depression might be an unpleasant yet adaptive response to affliction. Maybe Darwin was right. We suffer — we suffer terribly — but we don’t suffer in vain.

ANDY THOMSON IS a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia. He has a scruffy gray beard and steep cheekbones. When Thomson talks, he tends to close his eyes, as if he needs to concentrate on what he’s saying. But mostly what he does is listen: For the last 32 years, Thomson has been tending to his private practice in Charlottesville. “I tend to get the real hard cases,” Thomson told me recently. “A lot of the people I see have already tried multiple treatments. They arrive without much hope.” On one of the days I spent with Thomson earlier this winter, he checked his phone constantly for e-mail updates. A patient of his on “welfare watch” who was required to check in with him regularly had not done so, and Thomson was worried. “I’ve never gotten used to treating patients in mental pain,” he said. “Maybe it’s because every story is unique. You see one case of iron-deficiency anemia, you’ve seen them all. But the people who walk into my office are all hurting for a different reason.”

In the late 1990s, Thomson became interested in evolutionary psychology, which tries to explain the features of the human mind in terms of natural selection. The starting premise of the field is that the brain has a vast evolutionary history, and that this history shapes human nature. We are not a blank slate but a byproduct of imperfect adaptations, stuck with a mind that was designed to meet the needs of Pleistocene hunter-gatherers on the African savanna. While the specifics of evolutionary psychology remain controversial — it’s never easy proving theories about the distant past — its underlying assumption is largely accepted by mainstream scientists. There is no longer much debate over whether evolution sculptured the fleshy machine inside our head. Instead, researchers have moved on to new questions like when and how this sculpturing happened and which of our mental traits are adaptations and which are accidents.

In 2004, Thomson met Paul Andrews, an evolutionary psychologist at Virginia Commonwealth University, who had long been interested in the depression paradox — why a disorder that’s so costly is also so common. Andrews has long dark brown hair and an aquiline nose. Before he begins to talk, he often writes down an outline of his answer on scratch paper. “This is a very delicate subject,” he says. “I don’t want to say something reckless.”

Andrews and Thomson struck up an extended conversation on the evolutionary roots of depression. They began by focusing on the thought process that defines the disorder, which is known as rumination. (The verb is derived from the Latin word for “chewed over,” which describes the act of digestion in cattle, in which they swallow, regurgitate and then rechew their food.) In recent decades, psychiatry has come to see rumination as a dangerous mental habit, because it leads people to fixate on their flaws and problems, thus extending their negative moods. Consider “The Depressed Person,” a short story by David Foster Wallace, which chronicles a consciousness in the grip of the ruminative cycle. (Wallace struggled with severe depression for years before committing suicide in 2008.) The story is a long lament, a portrait of a mind hating itself, filled with sentences like this: “What terms might be used to describe such a solipsistic, self-consumed, bottomless emotional vacuum and sponge as she now appeared to herself to be?” The dark thoughts of “The Depressed Person” soon grow tedious and trying, but that’s precisely Wallace’s point. There is nothing profound about depressive rumination. There is just a recursive loop of woe.

The bleakness of this thought process helps explain why, according to the Yale psychologist Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, people with “ruminative tendencies” are more likely to become depressed. They’re also more likely to become unnerved by stressful events: for instance, Nolen-Hoeksema found that residents of San Francisco who self-identified as ruminators showed significantly more depressive symptoms after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. And then there are the cognitive deficits. Because rumination hijacks the stream of consciousness — we become exquisitely attentive to our pain — numerous studies have found that depressed subjects struggle to think about anything else, just like Wallace’s character. The end result is poor performance on tests for memory and executive function, especially when the task involves lots of information. (These deficits disappear when test subjects are first distracted from their depression and thus better able to focus on the exercise.) Such research has reinforced the view that rumination is a useless kind of pessimism, a perfect waste of mental energy.

That, at least, was the scientific consensus when Andrews and Thomson began exploring the depression paradox. Their evolutionary perspective, however — they see the mind as a fine-tuned machine that is not prone to pointless programming bugs — led them to wonder if rumination had a purpose. They started with the observation that rumination was often a response to a specific psychological blow, like the death of a loved one or the loss of a job. (Darwin was plunged into a debilitating grief after his 10-year-old daughter, Annie, died following a bout of scarlet fever.) Although the D.S.M. manual, the diagnostic bible for psychiatrists, does not take such stressors into account when diagnosing depressive disorder — the exception is grief caused by bereavement, as long as the grief doesn’t last longer than two months — it’s clear that the problems of everyday life play a huge role in causing mental illness. “Of course, rumination is unpleasant,” Andrews says. “But it’s usually a response to something real, a real setback. It didn’t seem right that the brain would go haywire just when we need it most.”

Imagine, for instance, a depression triggered by a bitter divorce. The ruminations might take the form of regret (“I should have been a better spouse”), recurring counterfactuals (“What if I hadn’t had my affair?”) and anxiety about the future (“How will the kids deal with it? Can I afford my alimony payments?”). While such thoughts reinforce the depression — that’s why therapists try to stop the ruminative cycle — Andrews and Thomson wondered if they might also help people prepare for bachelorhood or allow people to learn from their mistakes. “I started thinking about how, even if you are depressed for a few months, the depression might be worth it if it helps you better understand social relationships,” Andrews says. “Maybe you realize you need to be less rigid or more loving. Those are insights that can come out of depression, and they can be very valuable.”

This radical idea — the scientists were suggesting that depressive disorder came with a net mental benefit — has a long intellectual history. Aristotle was there first, stating in the fourth century B.C. “that all men who have attained excellence in philosophy, in poetry, in art and in politics, even Socrates and Plato, had a melancholic habitus; indeed some suffered even from melancholic disease.” This belief was revived during the Renaissance, leading Milton to exclaim, in his poem “Il Penseroso”: “Hail divinest Melancholy/Whose saintly visage is too bright/To hit the sense of human sight.” The Romantic poets took the veneration of sadness to its logical extreme and described suffering as a prerequisite for the literary life. As Keats wrote, “Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?”

But Andrews and Thomson weren’t interested in ancient aphorisms or poetic apologias. Their daunting challenge was to show how rumination might lead to improved outcomes, especially when it comes to solving life’s most difficult dilemmas. Their first speculations focused on the core features of depression, like the inability of depressed subjects to experience pleasure or their lack of interest in food, sex and social interactions. According to Andrews and Thomson, these awful symptoms came with a productive side effect, because they reduced the possibility of becoming distracted from the pressing problem.

The capacity for intense focus, they note, relies in large part on a brain area called the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), which is located a few inches behind the forehead. While this area has been associated with a wide variety of mental talents, like conceptual knowledge and verb conjugation, it seems to be especially important for maintaining attention. Experiments show that neurons in the VLPFC must fire continuously to keep us on task so that we don’t become sidetracked by irrelevant information. Furthermore, deficits in the VLPFC have been associated with attention-deficit disorder.

Several studies found an increase in brain activity (as measured indirectly by blood flow) in the VLPFC of depressed patients. Most recently, a paper to be published next month by neuroscientists in China found a spike in “functional connectivity” between the lateral prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain in depressed patients, with more severe depressions leading to more prefrontal activity. One explanation for this finding is that the hyperactive VLPFC underlies rumination, allowing people to stay focused on their problem. (Andrews and Thomson argue that this relentless fixation also explains the cognitive deficits of depressed subjects, as they are too busy thinking about their real-life problems to bother with an artificial lab exercise; their VLPFC can’t be bothered to care.) Human attention is a scarce resource — the neural effects of depression make sure the resource is efficiently allocated.

But the reliance on the VLPFC doesn’t just lead us to fixate on our depressing situation; it also leads to an extremely analytical style of thinking. That’s because rumination is largely rooted in working memory, a kind of mental scratchpad that allows us to “work” with all the information stuck in consciousness. When people rely on working memory — and it doesn’t matter if they’re doing long division or contemplating a relationship gone wrong — they tend to think in a more deliberate fashion, breaking down their complex problems into their simpler parts.

The bad news is that this deliberate thought process is slow, tiresome and prone to distraction; the prefrontal cortex soon grows exhausted and gives out. Andrews and Thomson see depression as a way of bolstering our feeble analytical skills, making it easier to pay continuous attention to a difficult dilemma. The downcast mood and activation of the VLPFC are part of a “coordinated system” that, Andrews and Thomson say, exists “for the specific purpose of effectively analyzing the complex life problem that triggered the depression.” If depression didn’t exist — if we didn’t react to stress and trauma with endless ruminations — then we would be less likely to solve our predicaments. Wisdom isn’t cheap, and we pay for it with pain.

Consider a young professor on tenure track who was treated by Thomson. The patient was having difficulties with his academic department. “This guy was used to success coming easy, but now it wasn’t,” Thomson says. “I made it clear that I thought he’d need some time to figure out his next step. His problem was like a splinter, and the pain wouldn’t go away until the splinter was removed.” Should the patient leave the department? Should he leave academia? Or should he try to resolve the disagreement? Over the next several weeks, Thomson helped the patient analyze his situation and carefully think through the alternatives. “We took it one variable at a time,” Thomson says. “And it eventually became clear to him that the departmental issues couldn’t be fixed. He needed to leave. Once he came to that conclusion, he started feeling better.”

The publication of Andrews and Thomson’s 36,000-word paper in the July 2009 issue of Psychological Review had a polarizing effect on the field. While some researchers, like Jerome Wakefield, a professor at New York University who specializes in the conceptual foundations of clinical theory, greeted the paper as “an extremely important first step toward the re-evaluation of depression,” other psychiatrists regarded it as little more than irresponsible speculation, a justification for human suffering. Peter Kramer, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, describes the paper as “a ladder with a series of weak rungs.” Kramer has long defended the use of antidepressants — his landmark work, “Listening to Prozac,” chronicled the profound improvements of patients taking the drugs — and criticized those who romanticized depression, which he compares to the glamorization of tuberculosis in the late 19th century. In a series of e-mail messages to me, Kramer suggested that Andrews and Thomson neglect the variants of depression that don’t fit their evolutionary theory. “This study says nothing about chronic depression and the sort of self-hating, paralyzing, hopeless, circular rumination it inspires,” Kramer wrote. And what about post-stroke depression? Late-life depression? Extreme depressive condition? Kramer argues that there’s a clear category difference between a healthy response to social stressors and the response of people with depressive disorder. “Depression is not really like sadness,” Kramer has written. “It’s more an oppressive flattening of feeling.”

Even scientists who are sympathetic to what Andrews and Thomson call the “analytic-rumination hypothesis” remain critical of its details. Ed Hagen, an anthropologist at Washington State University who is working on a book with Andrews, says that while the analytic-rumination hypothesis has persuaded him that some depressive symptoms might improve problem-solving skills, he remains unconvinced that it is a sufficient explanation for depression. “Individuals with major depression often don’t groom, bathe and sometimes don’t even use the toilet,” Hagen says. They also significantly “reduce investment in child care,” which could have detrimental effects on the survival of offspring. The steep fitness costs of these behaviors, Hagen says, would not be offset by “more uninterrupted time to think.”

Other scientists, including Randolph Nesse at the University of Michigan, say that complex psychiatric disorders like depression rarely have simple evolutionary explanations. In fact, the analytic-rumination hypothesis is merely the latest attempt to explain the prevalence of depression. There is, for example, the “plea for help” theory, which suggests that depression is a way of eliciting assistance from loved ones. There’s also the “signal of defeat” hypothesis, which argues that feelings of despair after a loss in social status help prevent unnecessary attacks; we’re too busy sulking to fight back. And then there’s “depressive realism”: several studies have found that people with depression have a more accurate view of reality and are better at predicting future outcomes. While each of these speculations has scientific support, none are sufficient to explain an illness that afflicts so many people. The moral, Nesse says, is that sadness, like happiness, has many functions.

Although Nesse says he admires the analytic-rumination hypothesis, he adds that it fails to capture the heterogeneity of depressive disorder. Andrews and Thomson compare depression to a fever helping to fight off infection, but Nesse says a more accurate metaphor is chronic pain, which can arise for innumerable reasons. “Sometimes, the pain is going to have an organic source,” he says. “Maybe you’ve slipped a disc or pinched a nerve, in which case you’ve got to solve that underlying problem. But much of the time there is no origin for the pain. The pain itself is the dysfunction.”

Andrews and Thomson respond to such criticisms by acknowledging that depression is a vast continuum, a catch-all term for a spectrum of symptoms. While the analytic-rumination hypothesis might explain those patients reacting to an “acute stressor,” it can’t account for those whose suffering has no discernible cause or whose sadness refuses to lift for years at a time. “To say that depression can be useful doesn’t mean it’s always going to be useful,” Thomson says. “Sometimes, the symptoms can spiral out of control. The problem, though, is that as a society, we’ve come to see depression as something that must always be avoided or medicated away. We’ve been so eager to remove the stigma from depression that we’ve ended up stigmatizing sadness.”

For Thomson, this new theory of depression has directly affected his medical practice. “That’s the litmus test for me,” he says. “Do these ideas help me treat my patients better?” In recent years, Thomson has cut back on antidepressant prescriptions, because, he says, he now believes that the drugs can sometimes interfere with genuine recovery, making it harder for people to resolve their social dilemmas. “I remember one patient who came in and said she needed to reduce her dosage,” he says. “I asked her if the antidepressants were working, and she said something I’ll never forget. ‘Yes, they’re working great,’ she told me. ‘I feel so much better. But I’m still married to the same alcoholic son of a bitch. It’s just now he’s tolerable.’ ”

The point is the woman was depressed for a reason; her pain was about something. While the drugs made her feel better, no real progress was ever made. Thomson’s skepticism about antidepressants is bolstered by recent studies questioning their benefits, at least for patients with moderate depression. Consider a 2005 paper led by Steven Hollon, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University: he found that people on antidepressants had a 76 percent chance of relapse within a year when the drugs were discontinued. In contrast, patients given a form of cognitive talk therapy had a relapse rate of 31 percent. And Hollon’s data aren’t unusual: several studies found that patients treated with medication were approximately twice as likely to relapse as patients treated with cognitive behavior therapy. “The high relapse rate suggests that the drugs aren’t really solving anything,” Thomson says. “In fact, they seem to be interfering with the solution, so that patients are discouraged from dealing with their problems. We end up having to keep people on the drugs forever. It was as if these people have a bodily infection, and modern psychiatry is just treating their fever.”

Thomson describes a college student who was referred to his practice. “It was clear that this patient was in a lot of pain,” Thomson says. “He couldn’t sleep, couldn’t study. He had some family issues” — his parents were recently divorced — “and his father was exerting a tremendous amount of pressure on him to go to graduate school. Because he’s got a family history of depression, the standard of care would be to put him on drugs right away. And a few years ago, that’s what I would have done.”

Instead, Thomson was determined to help the student solve his problem. “What you’re trying to do is speed along the rumination process,” Thomson says. “Once you show people the dilemma they need to solve, they almost always start feeling better.” He cites as evidence a recent study that found “expressive writing” — asking depressed subjects to write essays about their feelings — led to significantly shorter depressive episodes. The reason, Thomson suggests, is that writing is a form of thinking, which enhances our natural problem-solving abilities. “This doesn’t mean there’s some miracle cure,” he says. “In most cases, the recovery period is going to be long and difficult. And that’s what I told this young student. I said: ‘I know you’re hurting. I know these problems seem impossible. But they’re not. And I can help you solve them.’ ”

IT’S TOO SOON to judge the analytic-rumination hypothesis. Nobody knows if depression is an adaptation or if Andrews and Thomson have merely spun another “Just So” story, a clever evolutionary tale that lacks direct evidence. Nevertheless, their speculation is part of a larger scientific re-evaluation of negative moods, which have long been seen as emotional states to avoid. The dismissal of sadness and its synonyms is perhaps best exemplified by the rise of positive psychology, a scientific field devoted to the pursuit of happiness. In recent years, a number of positive psychologists have written popular self-help books, like “The How of Happiness” and “Authentic Happiness,” that try to outline the scientific principles behind “lasting fulfillment” and “getting the life we want.”

The new research on negative moods, however, suggests that sadness comes with its own set of benefits and that even our most unpleasant feelings serve an important purpose. Joe Forgas, a social psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia, has repeatedly demonstrated in experiments that negative moods lead to better decisions in complex situations. The reason, Forgas suggests, is rooted in the intertwined nature of mood and cognition: sadness promotes “information-processing strategies best suited to dealing with more-demanding situations.” This helps explain why test subjects who are melancholy — Forgas induces the mood with a short film about death and cancer — are better at judging the accuracy of rumors and recalling past events; they’re also much less likely to stereotype strangers.

Last year Forgas ventured beyond the lab and began conducting studies in a small stationery store in suburban Sydney, Australia. The experiment itself was simple: Forgas placed a variety of trinkets, like toy soldiers, plastic animals and miniature cars, near the checkout counter. As shoppers exited, Forgas tested their memory, asking them to list as many of the items as possible. To control for the effect of mood, Forgas conducted the survey on gray, rainy days — he accentuated the weather by playing Verdi’s “Requiem” — and on sunny days, using a soundtrack of Gilbert and Sullivan. The results were clear: shoppers in the “low mood” condition remembered nearly four times as many of the trinkets. The wet weather made them sad, and their sadness made them more aware and attentive.

The enhancement of these mental skills might also explain the striking correlation between creative production and depressive disorders. In a survey led by the neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen, 30 writers from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop were interviewed about their mental history. Eighty percent of the writers met the formal diagnostic criteria for some form of depression. A similar theme emerged from biographical studies of British writers and artists by Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, who found that successful individuals were eight times as likely as people in the general population to suffer from major depressive illness.

Why is mental illness so closely associated with creativity? Andreasen argues that depression is intertwined with a “cognitive style” that makes people more likely to produce successful works of art. In the creative process, Andreasen says, “one of the most important qualities is persistence.” Based on the Iowa sample, Andreasen found that “successful writers are like prizefighters who keep on getting hit but won’t go down. They’ll stick with it until it’s right.” While Andreasen acknowledges the burden of mental illness — she quotes Robert Lowell on depression not being a “gift of the Muse” and describes his reliance on lithium to escape the pain — she argues that many forms of creativity benefit from the relentless focus it makes possible. “Unfortunately, this type of thinking is often inseparable from the suffering,” she says. “If you’re at the cutting edge, then you’re going to bleed.”

And then there’s the virtue of self-loathing, which is one of the symptoms of depression. When people are stuck in the ruminative spiral, their achievements become invisible; the mind is only interested in what has gone wrong. While this condition is typically linked to withdrawal and silence — people become unwilling to communicate — there’s some suggestive evidence that states of unhappiness can actually improve our expressive abilities. Forgas said he has found that sadness correlates with clearer and more compelling sentences, and that negative moods “promote a more concrete, accommodative and ultimately more successful communication style.” Because we’re more critical of what we’re writing, we produce more refined prose, the sentences polished by our angst. As Roland Barthes observed, “A creative writer is one for whom writing is a problem.”

This line of research led Andrews to conduct his own experiment, as he sought to better understand the link between negative mood and improved analytical abilities. He gave 115 undergraduates an abstract-reasoning test known as Raven’s Progressive Matrices, which requires subjects to identify a missing segment in a larger pattern. (Performance on the task strongly predicts general intelligence.) The first thing Andrews found was that nondepressed students showed an increase in “depressed affect” after taking the test. In other words, the mere presence of a challenging problem — even an abstract puzzle — induced a kind of attentive trance, which led to feelings of sadness. It doesn’t matter if we’re working on a mathematical equation or working through a broken heart: the anatomy of focus is inseparable from the anatomy of melancholy. This suggests that depressive disorder is an extreme form of an ordinary thought process, part of the dismal machinery that draws us toward our problems, like a magnet to metal.

But is that closeness effective? Does the despondency help us solve anything? Andrews found a significant correlation between depressed affect and individual performance on the intelligence test, at least once the subjects were distracted from their pain: lower moods were associated with higher scores. “The results were clear,” Andrews says. “Depressed affect made people think better.” The challenge, of course, is persuading people to accept their misery, to embrace the tonic of despair. To say that depression has a purpose or that sadness makes us smarter says nothing about its awfulness. A fever, after all, might have benefits, but we still take pills to make it go away. This is the paradox of evolution: even if our pain is useful, the urge to escape from the pain remains the most powerful instinct of all.
