An agreement could be announced as soon as Sunday evening, one of these people said, while cautioning that the talks could still collapse.

If completed, the combination would unite two big makers of chips for industries ranging from automobiles to networking to mobile payments.

As of Friday evening, NXP had a market value of about $21 billion, while Freescale had a market capitalization of about $11 billion.

Both companies were previously parts of bigger corporations: NXP was formerly a division of Philips, while Freescale was a division of Motorola. Both were also owned by groups of private equity firms and returned to the public markets in rocky initial public offerings.

Representatives for NXP and Freescale were not immediately available for comment.

News of the discussions was reported earlier by Reuters.'"

"'15','2015-03-03','Bank of America Merrill Lynch has hired Lewis Steinberg, a senior banker from Credit Suisse, to serve as its in-house tax expert, the firm announced in an internal memorandum on Monday.

He will join in May as head of structured solutions for the American operations of the mergers business and will report to the co-heads of the unit, Patrick Ramsey and Jack MacDonald, according to the memo, which was reviewed by DealBook.

The hiring comes as tax considerations have played a big role in deal considerations. Some of the biggest attempted deals last year were so-called inversions, where United States companies sought foreign merger partners and then reincorporated abroad in a lower-tax country.

Mr. Steinberg, a lawyer by training, began his career in 1984 at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he became a co-head of the tax department. He then moved into banking, first at UBS and then at Credit Suisse, where he most recently was head of strategic advisory.

A spokesman for Merrill Lynch confirmed the contents of the memo.

The investment bank has made other prominent hirings over the last year, including Alastair Hunt, an industrials banker from Goldman Sachs, and John Griffifth, who rejoined the firm from Highwave Energy as a power and utilities specialist.

A message from Patrick Ramsey and Jack MacDonald, co-heads of Americas Mergers & Acquisitions We are pleased to announce that Lewis Steinberg will join our firm in May as a managing director and head of Structured Solutions in the Americas Mergers & Acquisitions group. With over 30 years of strategic advisory experience focused on tax, legal and accounting structuring on M&A and capital markets transactions, he brings deep expertise that will help further drive the growth of our M&A practice by delivering innovative solutions to our clients. Lew will be based in New York and report jointly to us. Lew joins our firm from Credit Suisse where he was a managing director and head of Strategic Advisory focused on structuring M&A transactions. Prior to that, he was a managing director and global head of the Strategic Solutions Group at UBS. Lew started his career in 1984 as an attorney at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP where he was a partner and co-head of the tax department. Please join us in welcoming Lew to our firm and in wishing him much success in his new role.'"

The resolution followed a report this year by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that chlorine bombs had been used in the conflict, even after the Syrian government had signed the global treaty banning such munitions and had agreed to the destruction of its arsenal, which was basically completed by June.

"'29','2015-03-08','Important segments of the health care system would be gravely damaged. As Stuart Butler, a leading conservative analyst, has noted, hospitals and insurance companies redesigned their business models to meet the needs and incentives of the Affordable Care Act on the assumption that they would be getting hordes of new patients who were once previously uninsured.

Hospitals that hired lots of health care workers to meet the anticipated demand would presumably have to lay them off. Insurers that set their rates on the assumption of high volume would have to recalibrate them and might leave the market. Trade groups for both hospitals and insurers have urged the Supreme Court to retain the subsidies.

State economies would suffer with the disappearance of the huge federal subsidies that help insure people; state governments would see reduced tax revenues when health care providers and insurers lose business. The two hardest-hit states would be , where the subsidies bring in about $400 million a month, and , which rakes in about $200 million a month, according to a senior economist at the RAND Corporation. That translates over the course of a year into billions of dollars in those two populous states.

In all 34 states combined, the Urban Institute estimates, health care spending in 2016 on behalf of those losing coverage would plummet from a projected $27.1 billion to $17.4 billion, leading to a loss of $112 billion over 10 years.

With people thrown off insurance, the states and their hard-pressed hospitals and doctors would also have to absorb much of the cost of uncompensated care. The , a gigantic health care system, estimates that uninsured patients are three times more likely than insured patients to use its emergency rooms, which are far more costly than outpatient clinics.

The Obama administration has said that it has no backup plan to cope with the loss of subsidies. The congressional Republicans who want to destroy Obamacare offer no meaningful plans to deal with the consequences.

Beyond economic damage, the lack of insurance almost always means that sick people get less care, with greater risk of death. The leading professional societies that battle , , heart disease, stroke and , in a brief to the court, cited extensive evidence that patients with adequate insurance are more likely to have their diseases managed or cured at an early stage, while uninsured patients tend to seek help only when the disease is advanced and treatment is ineffective and costly.

For instance, among patients with diabetes, 42 percent who lacked were undiagnosed compared with 26 percent for those with insurance, according to a 2008 study. A study using 2011-12 data put the numbers at 32 percent and 15 percent. The American Public Health Association and faculty members at schools of public health warned the court that ending the subsidies would result in more than 9,800 additional deaths a year.

The political opponents of Obamacare seem to think this fight is about ideology. What they refuse to acknowledge is the human toll and the economic devastation that destroying the heart of health reform will bring about.'"

"'57','2015-03-15','The Rev. Willie T. Barrow, who championed civil rights for minorities, women, gay people and consumers; opposed the war in Vietnam and apartheid; and mentored generations of community organizers, including a young Chicagoan named Barack Obama, died on Thursday at her home in Chicago. She was 90.

Her death was confirmed by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the alliance of two groups founded by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., of which she was chairwoman for a decade.

Ms. Barrow organized her first civil rights demonstration when she was 12, protesting the fact that she and her fellow black students had to walk to school in her hometown in Texas while whites could ride the school bus. She went on to conduct sit-ins and boycotts with luminaries of the movement, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, and joined in the 1963 March on Washington and the protests two years later in Selma, Ala. More recently she voiced concern over gun violence and dilution of the Voting Rights Act.

Willie Beatrice Taplin was born in Burton, Tex., on Dec. 7, 1924, to Nelson and Octava Taplin. Her father was a farmer and a Church of God minister. When she was 16 she moved to Oregon, where she studied theology, organized a Church of God group and worked as a welder in a shipyard, where she met Clyde Barrow, a fellow shipyard worker. They married and moved to Chicago in 1945.

In the early 1970s, she helped Mr. Jackson found Operation PUSH (the letters originally stood for People United to Save Humanity, later changed to Serve Humanity) and succeeded him as executive director when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s. She later served as chairwoman.'"
