BOBBE WAS BORN ON MAY 16, 1916, IN THE HARDSCRABBLE MINING TOWN OF BISBEE, AZ, AND MOVED WITH HER PARENTS TO BEVERLY HILLS WHEN SUNSET BOULEVARD HAD YET TO BE FULLY PAVED. SHE WAS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WOMAN IN THE 1940S, WHEN FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS WERE A RARE BREED, AND THROUGH THE 1980S, AS WOMEN INCREASINGLY ROSE TO PROMINENCE IN CORPORATE AMERICA.

WITH COLDWELL BANKER, BOBBE SOLD MANY OF THE MORE REMARKABLE LOS ANGELES HOMES OF HER TIME, REMARKABLE BOTH FOR THEIR LAVISHNESS AND THEIR RESIDENTS. BOBBE WAS ALSO AN OUTDOORS WOMAN AND ATHLETE, FISHING AND RIDING HORSES. SHE SKIED AND PLAYED TENNIS COMPETITIVELY, OFTEN AGAINST MEN. SHE RAISED AND TRAINED DOGS AND WAS A SPORTS CAR ENTHUSIAST, WELL, KNOWN FOR THE RAINBOW, PAINTED PORSCHE IN WHICH SHE MADE HER REAL ESTATE ROUNDS. BOBBE TRAVELED WIDELY THROUGHOUT EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA AND THE AMERICAS. AS A PATRON OF THE ARTS SHE GREATLY ENJOYED CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IN RECENT YEARS, LADY GAGA. HER RAPIER WIT AND PLAYFUL SENSE OF HUMOR WAS MATCHED BY HER CARE AND CONCERN FOR OTHERS. NEVER ONE TO TALK ABOUT HERSELF, BOBBE FOCUSED HER INCANDESCENT PERSONALITY ON WHOMEVER SHE WAS WITH; HER JOYFUL PRESENCE ABSORBED AS MUCH AS HER QUIET SMILE RADIATED. BOBBE LEAVES BEHIND FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES FROM BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL (1935, CLASS PRESIDENT), UC BERKELEY AND UCLA (1939, BA EUROPEAN HISTORY).

BOBBE WAS PREDECEASED BY HER YOUNGER BROTHERS BENNY (BEN JR.) (SAME DAY AS BOBBE, FEBRUARY 28, BUT 1973) AND MAYNARD FRANKLIN (2011). BENEFICIARIES OF BABETTE'S PROFOUNDLY PHILANTHROPIC NATURE INCLUDE SEVERAL HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES.
