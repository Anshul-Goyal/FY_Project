"'106','2015-05-29','Paid Notice: Memorials  GILBERT, S. PARKER. THE TRUSTEES AND STAFF OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART MOURN DEEPLY THE PASSING OF PARKER GILBERT, A DEVOTED LEADER AND FRIEND OF THE MUSEUM, AND ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE AND INFLUENTIAL TRUSTEES IN ITS HISTORY. HE SHARED HIS ADVICE AND BROAD EXPERTISE OVER MANY YEARS AS A TRUSTEE (1990, 2010), TRUSTEE EMERITUS (2010, 15), AND VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD (1999, 2010). HIS INVOLVEMENT ALSO EXTENDED TO CHAIRING THE MET'S NOMINATING AND INVESTMENT COMMITTEES, AND SERVING ACTIVELY AS A MEMBER OF ITS EXECUTIVE, COMPENSATION, FINANCE, BUDGET, ACQUISITIONS, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEES, AS WELL AS THE VISITING COMMITTEE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY ART. WITH HIS WIFE GAIL, HE MADE GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MUSEUM, INCLUDING A LANDMARK GIFT IN 2000 ESTABLISHING AN ENDOWMENT FUND THAT PROVIDES VITAL SUPPORT FOR A RANGE OF EXHIBITIONS. PARKER WAS A CALM, AUTHORITATIVE, AND REASSURING LEADER, PARTICULARLY DURING TIMES OF FISCAL STRAIN, AND HE WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO LOOK BEYOND THE HORIZON TO DEFINE AND CONTINUE TO BUILD A HEALTHIER MUSEUM. HE WAS A MENTOR TO STAFF AND FELLOW TRUSTEES, AND ALSO CONTRIBUTED GENEROUSLY IN THE TRADITION OF HIS FAMILY, THE MORGANS. ALWAYS HIGH, MINDED AND DETERMINED, WHILE DEEPLY HUMAN AND PHILANTHROPIC, HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLEAGUE WHOM WE WILL MISS GREATLY. WE EXTEND OUR HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO GAIL AND TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY. DANIEL BRODSKY, CHAIRMAN THOMAS P. CAMPBELL, DIRECTOR AND CEO EMILY K. RAFFERTY, PRESIDENT EMERITA 1'"
